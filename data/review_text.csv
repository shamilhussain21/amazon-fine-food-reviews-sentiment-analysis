"What the heck is going on with Lipton Darjeeling?  It disappeared from every one of the Indian shops in the S.F. Bay area about 6 months ago.  The tin you see above sold for about $11.  This tea was one of the best kept secrets I know.  Now the only tea approaching ... and I mean it is not as good ... it is Peet's Darjeeling, at $10 for 1/4 lb. tin.  The only other alternative for Darjeeling is to go to some of the Persian groceries and find it there.  They sell a brand that apparently has lower-quality Darjeeling that appears to be imported from India into Iran, then sent to U.S.  You could probably find other ethnic stores that have the same kind of thing.  Does anyone have an explanation for what is going on?"
"Like others have mentioned, yogurt made with this is much tastier than store bought.<br /><br />Be sure to use the right temperatures - heat to 180 degrees, the cool to 113 degrees<br />to add the starter. The high temperature changes the protein in the milk so the yogurt<br />sets better, just like when making custard from scratch.<br /><br />I use a yogoutmet model T yogurt maker, which is cool. and run it for 10 hours. This<br />converts most of the sugar, making the resulting yogurt nice and sour, the way I like it.<br />At this point you can use it in place of sour cream, and it will also stay intact better at<br />higher temperatures. If you thicken it bit more, by removing some of the whey, you<br />will have the thickness of Greek-style yogurt. You can also thicken it more to use in<br />place of cream cheese."
"These little toddler meals are simple, easy, and best of all, loved by my little munchkin (17 months old).  She lives two hours away with her mother, who is in college, so I send these meals to her apartment so that she has them there, as well as when she's with me (every other week).  They may be a little costly and not on a college student's budget, but I'm happy to ensure that my little munchkin has healthy meals that she loves and that make her feel independent (she can feed them to hershelf).  The size of the meat and carrots and green beans are perfect for a toddler to pick up with tiny fingers or a spoon and put in their mouth.  No ""choking"" incidents to date."
"This is a very neat gift for someone you know that is into cooking and eating.  It has a wide variety of exotic salt represented in the collection.<br /><br />There is a surprising amount of salt in the collection.  In other words, each tube holds about as much salt as would fill a small salt shaker."
"I ordered this for my step-children to give to their father for Father's Day.  It arrived exactly when it was supposed to, in a plain brown cardboard box so he had no idea what it was when he brought it in from the front steps.<br />It has been a huge hit!  He loves trying the different kinds of coffee each day.<br />While it was a little pricey for the size of the packets received, he has loved everyone of them so it was well worth the cost."
This is the easiest way to give your dog medicine. My dog prefers the chicken treats and she comes running everyday to take her meds. Terrific idea and I am only sorry I didn't know about it years ago.
My 10 year old daughter has alot of food allergies.  Two of them are gluten and milk.  This is as close to Mac and cheese that we have found.  We both thought it was very good.  We added tuna to it.  We will definitly be buying more.  Keep adding new products to your line.
"This coffee had two strikes against it: it was decaf, and it was already ground. I do use decaf, generally in a 50/50 mix with full strength caffeinated coffee, but I always like to grind my own beans to assure freshness. Still, I thought I'd give this Melitta coffee a shot (it was free from Vines, after all). I'm happy to say it surpassed expectations. I made a pot without mixing it with anything and drank it black, as I always do. It's surprisingly drinkable, if a little on the light side. Still, the taste is fairly rich and appealingly winey, though I do like a little more smoky aftertaste than this provides. (There's really not much aftertaste at all, truth be told.) It's as good if not better than nearly all the straight decaf coffee I've ever had, and having it ground as opposed to beans really doesn't seem to be an issue here. Ground coffee does tend to go stale more quickly than bean, so I'd suggest using it fairly quickly, but that's easy to do with a 10-ounce bag. If you're a decaf drinker and prefer not to have to grind beans, I'd highly recommend this brand..."
"Cutting sugar out of our diet,we went to splenda. Then finding that it was also unhealthy and baking with it made foods flat and dry. We went to stevia no calorie powder, after much research proved that stevia has been used for hundreds of years with no bad health effects. The trick to using stevia is to use tiny amounts and then taste it and add a bit more at a time to suit your taste. I also found that using a stevia that has an 80% ratio is the best tasting and this is the best that I have found. Because of using VERY SMALL amounts this jar lasts for months. This is also the best price ANYWHERE! Swanson is a trusted vendor as is Amazon."
"We've used this to make rolls, breadsticks and pizza - we think it makes a better pizza crust than their pizza crust mix (for kids especially). We'll continue to buy it."
"Taco Bell scores on this one. The flour tortillas are not too thin and not too thick, just right. Makes it easy to put a meal on the table really fast."
The best sauce on the market.  We use it on almost any food product but it is especially good on veggies.
"I have been getting these from Price Chopper in Paola, KS. However, I am afraid they will not be stocking them anymore.  They have reduced the price and I think I am the only one trying them!!I eat 7 crackers with a low calorie string cheese for breakfast every AM. Total 150 calories. You can put your breakfast in a baggie and go!"
"I bought cherry, lime and lemon flavors...all are wonderful. Not too hard and not too soft and with a perfect amount of sugar on them. I'll be back for more soon!"
"Saw this product online, looked over the reviews seemed favorable. I found this product to be extremely sweet; its main ingredient is sugar, it states that  right on the label. I wish was able to read the ingredients before I  purchased this product. I do not recommend this product to anyone who is trying to cut back on sugar in his or her diet."
"Used to subscribe to this item, as my dogs loved them, but I just found that they are made in china. I will never feed these to my dogs again or buy anything from the company."
I bought my first Primal Strips seitan jerky at the gym after a workout one day and since then I've been hooked. The mesquite lime is my favorite flavor. Super yummy and only 74 calories. It's a great non-soy protein-filled meatless snack. Plus it's totally portable so you can keep one in your desk drawer or your handbag for when you're stuck for a snack.
"I bought the packs after a trip to NYC -- and due to the long wait -- could not get into the restaurant.  It was pretty bad.  The chocolate had a weird after-taste.  I would have been better off making a chocolate milk shake.  In order to use up all of the packs, I am going to try to add coffee to the milk to try to mask that funny taste."
Items arrived in a timely manner and in excellent condition.  Will do business again with this vendor.
"A friend of mine brought these into work with the claim , ""these will change your life!""  While my life is fairly unchanged, I cannot get enough of these chips . . . . and I do not even like kettle chips.  For the most part, I find Kettle Chips to be too thick and greasy, but the flavor of these chips is amazing!  The are the type of hot that is refreshing.  If you do not enjoy spicy or hot things . . . try these anyway, they may convert you."
"I absolutely love these. A friend had found them in a random store down in Oklahoma a long time ago, and I thought they were awesome. But as I don't live in Oklahoma, and can't find these anywhere in the MN area, Amazon having them is awesome. They're low carb and taste pretty great."
"This is awful.  So, I got out the pots and pans and made a great no salt, little sugar and no butter fat tomato Soup using fresh tomatoes.  Tastes much, much better than this Tomato Soup!"
"So I have to start by saying I usually hate all hot drinks, including coffee and tea. But I tried this and LOVED it. I drink at least 2 or 3 cups every morning before breakfast. I add a little vanilla soy milk and splenda. Delicious treat!"
"Mixed with whipped cream and blueberries this lemon curd is a delicious, easy, quick summertime dessert that will delight any guests."
"There have been ongoing problems with dented and leaking cans with this product.  But my dogs HAVE to have it for their digestion, so I ordered a case somewhat reluctantly.<br /><br />In the first shipment I received, the cans were so badly dented that they looked like they had either been dropped from a considerable height or beaten with machetes.  One was actually leaking.  What's worse, the cans around the outside were apparently undamaged and had the damage turned to the INSIDE - and every badly damaged can was on the interior of the package.  That would seem to indicate that they were repacked to hide the damage -- otherwise the worst damage would be on the OUTSIDE.<br /><br />Good news:  Amazon cheerfully and without complaint replaced the bad cans, and while the replacement cans had a few dents they were not severe and nothing was leaking.<br /><br />That said, the pumpkin itself is not as good as Libby's solid pack.  It's very watery, and there are black flecks throughout.  I wouldn't use it for pies, but the dogs don't seem to care and it does them no harm."
"In my opinion, this is the best food for dogs.  My boyfriend is an avid researcher, and he concluded this is the bet food for dogs on all accounts - taste (the dogs love it), health-wise (it has healthy fats, and the first and main ingredient is meat as opposed to ingredients such as corn) and digestion-wise (the dogs get diarrhea when they eat human food or any other dog food).  We have two dogs we adopted from a shelter, and while at first, one of our dogs would not eat the food (he had worms though, so who knows what junk he was eating before), he soon began to understand that is what we were going to feed him and very soon, he came to love it.  Now they jump when it's dinner time!  Our dogs are happy, very healthy, have shiny coats, and a large part of this is due to this fantastic dog food.  We get it on Subscribe and Save and we usually go through 1 bag p/ month - for reference, we have one 15lb Bichon and one Alaskan husky."
I would not purchase this item again.  It has some sort of scent or perfume added which is not only very noticeable but unappetizing. No listing of any additive of that sort on the package except aromatic spices and I doubt there is anything in nature that smells like that. Packages are marked 'Product of China'.  I have had no problem with Lee Kum Kee sauces that I purchased in the past.
"This is wonderful food. I feed my lab a raw meat diet but you could easily add cooked beef or chicken as well. It's easy to make up a batch for the day or to make/freeze  in advance in case you'll be away or super-busy for awhile. My black lab Ally has been thriving on this food for over three years. She has  no skin irritations, appears to be allergy-free and has never had any kind of digestive problem. And her coat is really lovely...soft and glossy. This way of feeding is so much better than kibble. Hope you give it a try....."
"The spaces are interconnected under the blue top, hard sharp edges inside and on the mobile lining; and the dogs have a hard time getting to the food.  My little guy actually yelped, I suppose he got his tongue caught.  He did not go back to 'negative reinforcement....'  Not a good invention.........."
"I have tasted one too many different mustards which claim to be spicy, but fall short.  This spreads easy and is neither too thick, nor too thin.  It actually does have enough heat to taste, without being excessive.  This mustard would make a great addition to any sauces, marinades, salad dressings, or just for dipping!  I would recommend this product, for anyone who is looking for a mustard with some true heat."
"This is the closest thing I have found to a ""water cracker"" that's gluten free. There isn't any seasoning that would detract from or clash with whatever you put on this cracker, but for that same reason it doesn't really work well as a stand-alone, unless you just prefer a bland cracker. It's not at all salty. Texture...well, it breaks a little too easily, and when you chew it, it feels more powdery in your mouth than what you'd probably think of for a cracker, but it's not bad.  Of the Glutino crackers, we like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CWSK98"">Glutino Gluten Free Multigrain Crackers, 4.4 Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> best, because the fennel in the multigrain gives it a little more texture and taste.<br /><br />This is the only brand of GF cracker that my gluten-eating family will eat, other than <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00250HYA2"">Sesmark Ancient Grains Chips With Parmesan Herb, 3.5 Ounce Bags (pack of 12)[Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>] and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ET93N2"">Sesmark Savory Thins, Original, 3.2-Ounce Packages (Pack of 12)[Amazon Frustration-Free Packaging</a>] -- but Sesmark isn't marketed as GF, just as ""no gluten ingredients."" (I'm Celiac and never have reacted to Sesmark, but YMMV.)"
"If you like salt and vinegar chips and are looking for a healthier alternative, you have got to try these! They are absolutely addicting."
"I have just found out today that the gelatin in this product is coming from pork. I do not know why they would add gelatin in the first place. DHA from fish oil is fine, but the lady who answered my phone told me that all DHA Gerber baby food items have pork gelatin. Do infants need gelatin at this age?"
As with most of the reviews here my tins arrived with 75% or more of the wafers crushed. We ended up using a spoon to eat the crumbs of the 1st tin we opened. Outstandingly delicious but I cannot imagine serving these to guests as the chocolate had also melted and you cannot avoid getting chocolate on your fingers as you pick at the small remaining wafer tubes that are available. What a mess. If these had arrived whole they would get 5 stars instead of just 2.
"I buy mostly for vending, so the size of the bag is important. Kettle's 1 oz bag is a good size although it seems a bit less than full. Salt & Vinegar flavor is satisfying, about an 8 out of 10."
"My dog loves this food and it has really cut back on the tear staining issues.  The staining was a big problem and I did quite a bit of research to find a solution. I considered a few products that you add to the dog food or come in pill form and several of these apparently  work however many of them are actually antibiotics I am not sure it is a good idea to use very often.  My research  led me to antioxidants (like blueberries) and avoiding wheat to cut back on the tear stains and give him a healthier coat. This food is not only grain free but is also loaded with blueberries.<br /><br />Yes, the first ingredient is potato however in FirstMate's defense, most companies include several non-protein ingredients so that they can put them lower down on the list thus making it look like there is more protein than anything else.  Also, meat ""meal"" is a much more concentrated protein than regular meat (somewhere in the range of 300% more concentrated)."
The individual Pocky sticks are not separately packaged and melt and stick together while being shipped.
"I purchased two boxes of this because previously I had purchased Happy Baby Chick Chick and my daughter loved it.  When I opened this pouch up I couldn't believe the smell and texture of the ""food"".  It smells just like cat food because it's fish.  And the texture is just like canned cat food.  I have two boxes of this that I can't use because my daughter gags as soon as I bring the spoon up to her mouth.  I don't blame her, I'm gagging as soon as I tear the package open.  The nutritional facts are outstanding but they need to make it taste and look better.  The Happy Baby Chick Chick is an actual hearty puree with pieces of chicken and pasta.  This is not even close."
"The new recipe has more Dextrose than Salt -- who on earth would want a *sweet* fishy caviar? It makes no sense to anyone who loves the taste of light, salty caviar. Very disappointing, and I hope Romanoff gets rid of the person who had the brainwave to change caviar into candy-ar. Arrrrh!"
Its allergy season which usually means large amounts of sudafed.  I don't particularly like the side affects of sudafed and have tried tons of different decongestants.  This is the first thing other than sudafed to actually work!  I have not tried it during a sinus migraine yet but for moderate congestion it works wonders.  Smells a bit off but the taste is just fine.  Make sure to seep it for 10-15 mins or it won't work.  Give it about 10-20 mins to kick in.  Seems to last for 3-4 hrs.  No side affects that I can tell.  So glad to be rid of the racing heart side affect and dry mouth/ sore throat that comes with sudafed.  It works great paired with a sinus rinse or netty pot.
"I was really hoping to get a really great nutritious & delicious snack for my family when I ordered this product.  I was really disappointed.<br /><br />The packaging is really good looking and I had high hopes, so when I opened the package to my chips, I expected something great.  I ordered the Chili Lime flavor and, since, I have had higher-fat chili lime chips in the past, I'd knew that I would love them.<br />First, they don't really look like what they appear to be on the packaging (no big deal though).<br />I took a bite out of the first chip and it had a really funny texture and strange flavor.  So, I looked on the back where it showed the ingredients and I was pretty surprised--it had a LOT of chemicals in the product.  Also, AND THIS REALLY FREAKED ME OUT, the main ingredient is not a sliced potato, but, ""potato ingredients (potato flakes, potato starch)"".  In other words, it's made of instant mashed potatoes!<br /><br />I thought the taste was funny and the ingredients curious.  However, there are no transfats or saturated fats in the chips (that's why I gave it 2-stars).<br /><br />All in all, I would rather pack my kids lunches with a bag of Lay's or Kettle chips than give them these chips.<br /><br />All The Best."
"So I am the proud owner of an almost 80-lb. 1-year-old lab mix whose sole mission in life is to seek and destroy.  I have been looking for toys that would hold his interest longer than the 5 minutes it takes him to rip them to pieces, and saw this at my local pet store, but in the small size.  I was thrilled to see the larger size on Amazon, and ordered it.  This is a toy for smart dogs, and, of course, I like to think my dog is smart.  However, he may be too smart.  Gave it to my dog tonight.  It was interesting to watch him try to figure out how to get the treats out, and he seemed occupied.  I walked away to leave him to his work.  10 minutes later, he had chewed through the rope coming out of the top of the bottle.  He cheated.  This had potential to be an awesome, time-consuming toy to same some of my sanity.  Unfortunately, if you have a strong chewer, or a dog who can figure out the short cuts, save your money."
"This is the smoothest and best tasting Keurig coffee I've tried.  It's not bitter, not too weak, not too strong, just right!"
My husband Loves this coffee he says to so smooth.  He loves the extra zing it give him in the morning.
"I love Sumatra coffee and was excited to receive these K-Cups however was disappointed when I opened my Amazon box and found that the plastic wrap holding the two boxes of K-Cups was full of grinds meaning that there was a possible blowout of a cup... after carefully unwrapping the boxes and attempting to get as little coffee grinds everywhere as possible I opened the first box and all cups were fine, however the second box every kcup was covered in fine grinds and I had to clean each one and found that 3 of the cups were defective due to the top being stamped on at an angle and the grinds had spilled everywhere. I now see other reviews stating they had defective cups as well. However the taste of the coffee is good."
"I had high hopes for this product when I first opened the package because the noodles had a great texture and the sauce looked appealing.  The food was easy to prepare at my workplace.  However to me, the taste was very oily and flavorless.  I'm a big peanut satay fan and was expected more spice in the flavor."
"We have had it less than three months. We have to descale about once a week. Our water has 1 gram of hardness. Almost perfect. They have sent new water reservoir (which by the way Keurig has great help line). But, honestly for the money the Mr. Coffee is better.  You just have to add the water each time. But it works each time. It is very hard to get a consistent full cup of coffee out of this Keurig machine."
"Bits of ""Clam?"" (not sure) in water with something I assume is potatoes. Whose recipe is this? save your money get something worth having. How do so many like this?! It's awful! If you prefer REAL Clam Chowder and not seawater with something floating in it DO NOT buy this!"
"THis product (which i am not allowed to return) has ingrediants of salt, spices, hydrolysed soy protein, that last item is the common industry con for adding msg to your food. Every soup on your grocers shelf contains msg, but, i digress. So, the third ingrediant is a form of MSG, further down the ingrediant list is proudly displayed ... Monosodium Gludamate, ...MSG. This does not add spice to your food, it stimulats your tongue into feeling that the food tastes good, when IT DOES NOT. MSG can make dogfood taste like hamburger. anyone who thinks this is making their food taste cajun may be serving ALPO.  Tones and Durkee (sp) do not contain MSG, I prefer Tones!<br /><br />I have 8 eight ounce cans of this stuff.. would anybody like to buy some hamburger from me?"
"This is the moistest, most delicious cake in the world.  if you like almond tarts, marzipan, that kind of taste, you will be in love with this cake.  Normally I think packaged cake is awful, by the way.  This one is amazing."
"I bought a big bag of these and I don't mind the strong pepper taste. What I do mind is the bag implies these are Potato chips.<br /><br />There is absolutely no potato taste left in this snack; if you like eating extremely salty onion powder this snack is for you.<br /><br />Going by the bag I expected: REAL potatos, a little oil and baking, finally sprinkled with salt and pepper only? Not a long list with things like Cane Sugar, Rice flour, maltodextrin......list of ingredients goes on and on.<br /><br />If you're looking for BAKED POTATO, salt and pepper chips don't bother with these!<br /><br />--VS"
"In order for tea to be labeled ""decaff"" is must be under 0.4% caffeine when residue levels are tested.  A tea at 2% caffeine is not decaff.  Non-decaff tea is anywhere between 3-5% caffeine.  So ...  at 2% caffeine, this is a caffeinated tea, with caffeine slightly less than what is naturally present in the tea leaf."
Salt & vinegar chips are my favorite flavor so I think I've tried every brand out there.  These are by far the best.  I also like them because the sodium content is not very high like some of the others and they are not excessively greasy.  They seem to have the right balance of the salt and vinegar taste.
I really like this tea.  I have found it has more flavor than other decaf teas.  It has a great flavor.  I'm am glad Amzon has it because it is hard to find.  Great product.
Great taste no carbs (I am diabetic) and low cal also. Only drawback may be sodium content. When you need a cracker for a dip I use them. I just make the dip from fat free sour cream and onion soup mix. The dip has more cal than the pork rinds. I n short they are a cracker substitute for me.<br /><br />Most complaints are  improper  cooking  results. Hate to say this but it is your microwave not the product. There are microwave ovens that have a real bad hot spot and this burns them. I had an oven like this (older model)and the problem went away with  the new  microwave.<br /><br />But the biggest thing in their favor is the taste. Love both kinds.
"We switched or dog to the canned All Ages food. She has had diarrhea and vomiting for 2 days. She has never been ill and is a very healthy dog - 19 years old.<br /><br />Look online and investigate this product via consumer affairs. The story is very common, some dogs even dying from GI tract infections, siezures and horrible allergies.<br /><br />We'll be switching her back to the old standby, SOJO's. She's kind of tired of it, but we know it is good for her and won't hurt her."
"This starter was so easy to use. I don't use any sugar in my yogur and I was pleasently surprise how sweet and firm my yogurt came out, even though I use non fat milk. This is a good product and I would buy it again."
this is a fine example of mineral-rich himalayan salt. The packaging also keeps it fresh. It comes in a zip-seal pouch.
"I read a reference to these on Jillian Michaels's website, checked out the Popchips web page, and liked everything I read. But the proof is in the tasting, of course. They arrived today and the consensus here in this house is that Popchips are incredible. They taste SINFULLY good, crunchy and just yummy. I love sea salt and vinegar chips in general, and truly LOVED the popchips version. Anyone on Weight Watchers plus will be happy to know that a single serving bag is only 3 measly points. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!"
"Chewed a few of these and ate cheese, hot sauce and a bunch of citrus. Pretty neat stuff. If it was less expensive I could see this benefiting those who'd like to cut down on their sugar but still enjoy fruits."
"Now a days when  you think of Soda most people think of unhealthy, bad for your body, stains your teeth, and the list can go on and on. Not true with the lastest soft drink craze, Switch. This carbonated soft drink beverage is the perfect blend of healthy and fun! Definitely one to try out!"
"I bought a couple of flavors from Halo's, both were not a hit with my cats unfortunately. My cats would not touch it."
"I drank a single can of the Switch Orange Tangerine flavor today.  Upon first impression, the physical size of the can is a tiny -- 8oz or 250ml.  This in contrast to a regular can of soda size which is 12 ounces or 355 ml.  Therefore, only about 2/3 the content of a normal can of soda.  To say the least, this isn't enough liquid for me in one sitting.  I need more to drink than that to quench a tiny bit of thirst so I was quite disappointed without even opening the thing up.<br /><br />The taste of the drink itself was satisfying.  Since there is no added sugar (which is usually corn syrup in the US) the flavor was not too sweet nor was it too bland.  However, it wasn't anything like drinking a fresh bottle of 100% natural juice.  More on the side of mixed syrup with water.<br /><br />What kills this product is the high price.  Product right now comes out to about a buck a can.  I would be angry paying that out of a vending machine for its small size but for purchasing in bulk, it is an insult to say the least.  Not worth the money."
"What HAPPYBABY needs to realize is that when you have a steady customer base, you should not change the recipe of a product!  My daughter loved this original recipe, but this recipe is COMPLETELY different.  I tried giving it to her 3 times - she refused to eat it.  I then blended it with chicken broth and she does eat it now, so it turned out to be a texture thing.  HOWEVER, the whole reason that I purchase products such as these are for the convenience of having an organic product that can travel easily - so it is very impractical for me to travel with chicken broth and a blender!  I'll be cancelling my subscribe and save subscription to this product."
Every year for the holidays I buy my brother a pack of these chai tea packets for him to use at university. he loves them!
"It's too bitter (read: over-roasted), but a pinch of salt calms it down nicely, and it does have a good full flavor which, again, would be more noticeable if it weren't so burnt."
The bonsai I got looked nothing like the one I ordered.  I was very unhappy when I paid for something that I didn't want.
"Great for large and small breeds.  Fairly simple puzzle, but adds variety to other puzzles.  You can increase resistance on the bottom, to increase difficulty.  Good puzzle, no complaints."
Did not smell as fresh as I had hoped.  My cat was uninterested.  Trader Joe's has organic catnip that comes with a scratcher for $6.99 which smells much more potent.  Maybe try a different brand?
"What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets. I am also a big fan of Stash products, or rather of all the other stash products I have tried.<br />I purchased a case of all 4 varieties,  (when i say i drink iced tea, i am not kidding) and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my 16 ounces water bottle.<br />I finally found that i needed to dissolve 2 packets in a small bit of hot water first (if not the tea clumped on me), and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatable.<br />Over all I am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market."
the taste shocked me.....i instantly tasted it comparing it to the 2% i have been drinking all my life...and when you have those expectations it will let you down..when i got over it i noticed it just taste like liquid almonds and i love almonds so its very nice to me...and if you like almonds i don't see why you wouldn't like the taste
"I love this peanut butter.  It tastes incredible!  I wouldn't say that I feel like I'm eating a dessert.  To me, it's not THAT sweet.  The sweetness of the chocolate is more subtle, but delicious nonetheless.  I also don't use jelly with this, nor do my children feel like they need jelly with it."
"We have a 7 week old... He had gas and constipation problems for the first 5 weeks. We tried two different kinds of similac including for fussiness and gas and neither seemed to work. We switched to the organic a few weeks ago and saw quick improvement. I wish I could breast feed but I'm unable to, so for now this seems the best option especially since it was recommended we stick with a ready made formula for the gas problems.<br />Ive read a lot of the reviews and took into consideration the information about sucrose. I plan on talking to the pediatrician and my midwife for additional information beyond the article written about it, especially since that is from 2008. I realize the concern and I am doing research on making my own formula so I know exactly whats in it and that its organic, but in the mean time baby L eats great with this, is healthy, and has fewer stomach problems. It's middle of the road when it comes to $ - although Amazn is one of the more expensive places!!! Target has the best price. So for now it works and I recommend it!!"
"First, let's talk about the packaging.  I hate when coffee come packaged in bags like this.  They're quite cumbersome and in my opinion, do not keep the coffee fresh enough.<br /><br />As for the coffee itself, this was one of the better tasting decaf's I have had.  It has a very rich flavor that you do not normally find with decaffeinated coffee.  It has a wonderful aroma as well.  Very pleased with this product."
"I have been on Weight Watchers since June 24th of this year and have successfully lost 35 lbs. The one thing I missed was peanut butter!! It is very costly on the weight loss system that Weight Watchers established, Points Plus. When I saw it on Dr Phil's show, I was curious, ordered it and was I HAPPY. Mixing it with water, the recommended serving is 1 point, regular peanut butter can be as much as 5 points. When using sugar free jam or syrup to mix the powder in, the taste is wonderful and has the consistency of peanut butter, thanks to whom ever developed this product,for someone like myself, trying to get healthier,well this is just a blessing. I encourage anyone who is a peanut butter lover like me, and would like to have the taste without all of the fat and calories, GO FOR IT."
"We love these pretzels. They taste like normal white pretzels to me. My whole family eats them--baby on up. I never bought pretzels before because they were made with white flour, and I was so thrilled to find these."
"I wanted to solely breastfeed but was unable to keep up and had to supplement formula.  I chose Similac because they are a very reputable company and I had a ton of it from the hospital.  We have used both the powder and ready made and he likes both.  He got a little constipated at the beginning but has been on it now for 5 months and no problems.  I read some other reviews about sucrose...well, sucrose is just sugar and ALL formula has sugar in it.  Other companies just label it differently and since ths one is organic it has to contain a pure sugar.  As far as the hexane goes, I did my research, ALL formulas except one (Babys Only) use the hexane method.  Babys Only contains brown rice syrup that has been shown to have high levels of arsenic..uh, no thanks.  Also Similac has been tested and found to have no hexane present in the product.  Overall my baby is healthy and smart so I am very happy with this formula."
All three flavors have a nice aroma and rich chocolate taste. Peppermint is our favorite. We enjoy a cup after dinner 'flavored' with a bit of creme liquor nearly every night. It's become a tasty habit.
"I'm on my third bag of these, I've been using them for raw food prep.  They are consistently fresh and the price is great!"
"The initial aroma upon opening the package was decent, though subtle. Unfortunately, it quickly dissipated - I really couldn't smell anything after a minute, which I assume is due to it being pre-ground.<br /><br />I brewed this coffee in a French press as well as in a drip brewer. Both results tasted flat and boring, although there was a decent amount of body - at least it was inoffensive. Perhaps a notch up from bad diner coffee. For about the same price, you could get better tasting fresher beans from a cafe or natural foods store."
"Why the heck can't Townhouse just get crackers right for once? Remember that feeling of dread you got when you slept over a friend's house and they had brands/foods not part of your world? That's the feeling that these crackers arise. A little too crunchy, a little too ""fried"", a little too much olive oil/spice imbibed (yes, despite the olive oil and sea salt proclamation on the box, there is garlic and onion present). Hey, you see these at your next sleepover, make up a rambling excuse referencing obscure food allergies, and flee."
"I bought two bags of PopChips at Whole Foods (Original and Barbeque)and loved them.  When I went to Amazon to order lots more, I liked the idea of single serving bags rather than the larger ones, which I'd consume too quickly.  I knew I was taking a risk but when the order came, I really disliked about half of the flavors in the assortment.  In addition, only the Original and Barbeque nutritional values calculated at 2 pts; the others were all 3.  I still like PopChips but will only buy bags of the flavors I know I will enjoy eating and not have to choke down.  I recommend that you try a bag of each flavor before you spring for a volume order."
Almost no detectable coffee flavor below the raspberry aroma. Probably would go well for those that like flavored creamers. Mostly this is warm water that smells like raspberries. Very little detectable chocolate. I bought this as an alternative for my kids. It might work for them when the hot chocolate runs out.
"Kettle brand chips are probably the best potato chips I've tasted thus far. They are thick, has a bite to them and I love their creative flavors. My favorite Kettle chip happens to be the honey Dijon. I think it's a great combination sweet, salty and tangy, perfect for one of those snack attacks when you don't know exactly what you want. I especially love the curled up chips for extra texture and crunch. These 2-oz bags are perfect for anyone who has a problem controlling portions (like me!)."
If you expect this to taste like dr peppeper you will be very disappointed like I was. Sad to say but this product really needs a taste review before they offer it to the public. Do not bother with it.
"Sun Maid quality... cheaper than the grocer... nice flavour, but the smell takes getting used to as with all dried peaches."
"Twinings developed this tea last year (2006) for their 300th anniversary - a counterpart to their famous ""Earl Grey"" product.  ""Lady Grey"" has the distinctive Earl Grey flavor but with just a hint of floral.  It has become my family's favorite tea.  We can no longer get it in our stores but is easily available on-line from Twinings.  Buy it - maybe we'll get it back in our stores!  A wonderful product!"
"If you're in the same position as I am, and don't live near a Whole Foods or World Market, you might be paying lots of money per box at local or online boutiques. This is the second purchase of Amazon Barry's I've made, and it's been really good. The stuff is fresh, the price is right (especially if you get free shipping), and the tea is Barry's. If you can't drink 6 boxes of 80 bags all on your own, get a friend or two to go in with you"
"I have had real truffles only once that I can recall, and that very old memory is of a sublime taste.  The slippery terminology used for 'truffle' oil gave me pause, but I decided to take a chance.  To me, ""infused"" implies that something has been marinated in a liquid, not that a chemical has been simply mixed in.  Sure enough, the ingredient list on the bottle is limited to olive oil and truffle ""aroma.""<br /><br />When I opened the bottle, I could only detect a garlic-like aroma, pleasant but not sublime.  I first tried adding 1/4 teaspoon to a small serving of scrambled eggs, and could detect nothing.  Today I made a 'two egg' (1/2 cup of eggbeaters) omelet flavored with tarragon and filled with simple sauteed potatos, scallions, and mushrooms.  I drizzled on a full teaspoon of the 'truffle oil' after the omelet was set, immediately before filling and folding it.<br /><br />Again, I could discern no flavor or aroma other than the above ingredients.  I rated this at 2 stars rather than one on the charitable assumption that a younger nose might detect some sort of aroma."
"This has more calories than a regular coke. Even though it says 100% pure juice and no sugar/syrup added, it still tastes so sweet that I couldn't even finish one can.<br /><br />If this weren't so sugary tasting, I'd like it much more. Flavor-wise it's not bad, though. Maybe it's only fruit sugar and supposedly fruit sugar isn't as bad for the health, but still... way too sweet for something that's supposed to be ""healthy.""<br /><br />Maybe little kids would like it as a treat. Probably beats having candy."
When I placed my order it was for Hartz Pigskin 10 pack with sweet potato center.  When I received the order it was Hartz Pigskin 10 packs but it was all pigskin and this is not easy for my dog to chew.  I contacted the company and they were very nice about the hole thing as they refunded the money to my credit card and told me to take the pigskin packs to a local shelter or SPCA.  They were also very fast in sending out the original product.  They told me that they forgot to change the photo from sweet potato center to all wrapped pigskin and they would do that.
"My mom bought me this coffee maker for my birthday and I am in love with it.  Granted, this the first and only Keurig coffee maker I have had, it does everything it should.  And it makes excellent coffee.  I can have a warm cup of fantastic-quality coffee in about a minute, start to finish. I have had it for about 3 months now and haven't had any problems at all.  I am planning on buying one for my mom for Christmas."
"I ordered this cupcake mix because a coworker was having a birthday and our supervisor has Celiac Disease.  Needless to say, I wanted to make sure he got to eat a cupcake too, but I didn't want to buy a bunch of weird flours and get stuck with the excess.<br /><br />One box didn't make 12 cupcakes like the box said, although if you don't fill the cupcake cups up, i'm sure you could get 12 out of the mix.  I like to fill my cupcakes a little fuller though, for aesthetics, so I ended up using both boxes to make about 18 cupcakes.<br /><br />The flour mixture itself was very fluffy and well sifted, which always makes for a nice cake consistency.  I didn't use the box directions, and instead used the weight watchers reecipe using orange soda and egg whites instead of eggs and butter.  The vanilla flavor wasn't completed covered up by the soda, so I imagien in a vanilla preparation it would taste pretty good.  The only off-putting part was when the cupcakes came out of the oven, they smelled a bit liek corn muffins.  but by the time they were frosted and decoarted, I didn't notice the corn smell.<br /><br />For the frosting packet, I used the butter and milk as described, but added orange flavoring to go with the orange soda cupcakes.  I think the buttercream mix was basically just confectioner's sugar that was processed without gluten 9since I think alot of corn starch used in regular powdered sugar is processed with wheat).  It didn't make very much frosting though.  Both packets together wouldnt have covered 24 cupcakes, but since I only ended up with 18 it came out perfectly.<br /><br />I made the cupcakes the night before they'd be served,  and the next day they were a little gummy, but not really much worse for the wear.  If I made these again, I'd probably store them covered on the counter, then frost the day of to keep them from getting gummy in the fridge.<br /><br />All in all, they got the job done - without any reactions(!) and all the 'normal' eaters still liked them!"
"I got the coffee for 12.50 per box.  Ordered 4 boxes!!  Such a great deal, as the coffee is a great blend.<br /><br />If anyone is upset because of the website having issues when they were trying to buy it, they shouldn't review the product poorly, as it is not the product that is the problem.<br /><br />The problem is that you're jealous you didn't get such a great deal on the coffee.  Grow up kids, this coffee is great!!!  Will buy from Amazon.com, LLC again for more K-Cups for my Keurig.<br /><br />ALL OF MY COFFEE ARRIVED PACKAGED WELL AND IN NEW CONDITION, NOTHING WRONG WITH IT!!"
"My kid loves this stuff.  Since it comes 16 packages at a time, I have several packages leftover and now that he's almost 2, I still give it to my kid as a big appetizer while we order and wait for the food to come at restaurants.  He still loves it (despite being able to eat all sorts of ""regular"" food).  Much better than just loading up on tortilla chips at Mexican restaurants!"
"Our family has liked every other flavored we have tried (BBQ is the best). We like sweet potatoes so we assumed would like these pop chips.  I was wrong, no one in the family likes the sweet potato pops chips.<br /><br />I highly recommend you go to a store that sells the sweet potato before deciding on purchasing a large quantity."
"These are just the right size for a quick reward and as a treat for ""I'm sorry I was away so long - thank you for understanding"" or any other excuse you can find to treat your pet because you always have the happy tail wag afterwards! My dogs gave this treat 5 woofs!!!  So that must be good!"
"I'm amazed that people are happy with this product.  I'm not a drinker of the dark brews, French roast or anything, but even for a drinker of a milder cup of coffee, this is completely tasteless.  The initial scent is delicious, too bad none of it shows up in the actual coffee."
Sardines used to gross me out but these aren't mushy or too stinky like some sardines you can get. I like how neatly packed they are in their little can. I just throw some hotsauce on em and chow down. These are my favorite by far and told my grandfather about them.<br /><br />The other reviews say more about the reviewers than the product.
This is the buy of a lifetime.  $25 for about 50 beans instead of $10 for 2!  And the flavor was great.  Made ice cream that everyone raved about.  I vacuum sealed portions for future use to keep them as fresh as possible.
"Being a fan of Newman's Pineapple salsa for quite a while, I was looking for a comparable salsa.  This is one of the best tasting salsas I've ever had.  My daughters love it too.  They don't like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces.  The salsa is not too sweet, just sweet enough and although it's mild, it has a nice little kick to it.  At this price, it's a steal!"
"How about this idea? Even though we buy the non-hydrogenated ""natural"" peanut butter (Skippy, mainly)  sometimes it is still separated so there is oil on the top. Even though you can mix that oil back into the peanut butter, when you do the results are usually a fairly runny peanut butter unless you refrigerate it. Or, you could drain the oil off, but that's such a waste. So, we like to mix in some of this powdered peanut butter to thicken those runny non-hydrogenated peanut butters up! The flavor is never diluted, it is rich and delicious!"
"These popchips are a great alternative when you need a munchie, crunchie snack. They are much lower in calories/fat than regular chips and are portioned controlled. I especially like the barbeque flavor or the salt and pepper flavored popchips."
"I ordered 6 boxes of these crackers. The crackers are very good, however, all of the crackers (in all 6 boxes) were nothing but crumbs when I received them!"
This chocolate treat is a great gift and it arrived right when I expected it to. I gave it to my girlfriend as a surprise gift and she absolutely loved it.
"I drink a LOT of water.  I have my Thermos Intak bottle with me 24/7, even on my bedstand at night.  I've began referring to it as my security blanket.  But as people do, I wanted something a little different, natural, and portable.  ENTER CRYSTAL LIGHT PURE!<br /><br />This stuff is delicious!  A better alternative to sports drinks, better for the environment (cutting back on waste), and I'm assuming more cost effective.  The Tropical Blend is my favorite.  It's complex, sweet, but not too sweet, with a little tartness.  There's also the flexibility with these packets to make it as strong or as weak as you want it.<br /><br />I've even started mixing it with iced tea at restaurants!  Arnie Palmers, eat your heart out!<br /><br />All in all, great bang for your buck, go ahead and try it.  You know you're getting sick of all that high fructose stuff you put in your body anyway!"
"Can't live without these little jewels.  Not only is there a surprise in the middle, but it takes me right to the French countryside while enjoying them."
"Works great. Definitely worth the $21.38. I read another review that the drawer sticks. I ran into this problem also. Easy fix, just bend the sides of the pull out drawer in (with a little bit of pressure). I was afraid that I might break it, but it seems to be very sturdy. Like I said just a little bit of pressure & the drawer slides out no problem. Believe me if it had issues I would never hear the end of it from my wife. Also I have my Keurig B40 on top of it with no issues of bowing, & there is enough room on the side to fit some containers ""Creamer & Sugar"". Makes the counter top a lot more functional."
"I will no longer be giving these to my dog!! They caused my dog to have diarrhea and vomit! When I did some more research online, there were many many posts about how the treats caused their dogs to have similar and even much more severe health issues! My dog loves these treats. I have been giving these to her for about a year or two now. Every once in a while she would have diarrhea or start vomiting a yellow foamy substance- in most cases both, and I finally now linked it to these treats. Do your research before you buy this product!! However, I would not recommend these at all!"
"I've never bought flavored syrups before but wanted to try them. These six flavors are each 25.4 ounces, are sweetened with Splenda and come in plastic bottles.  There is no pump on the bottles, although you can buy one.<br /><br />I think it's generous to call these ""syrup"" as they are the consistency of water.  But the flavors are bold, and if you're careful pouring they will last a long time.  We've experimented with the vanilla, hazelnut classic, caramel, chocolate and raspberry flavors so far.<br /><br />I've used the vanilla, hazelnut, caramel and chocolate in my morning coffee, and they add a nice flavor without overpowering the coffee.  I'm guessing I added about a tablespoon per cup of coffee.<br /><br />My kids liked the chocolate flavor mixed into hot cocoa.  We mixed some of the raspberry flavor into homemade yogurt, and that was pretty tasty too.  We haven't tried the Irish cream flavor yet, but I've used it in coffee before and I'm sure it will be the same.<br /><br />Overall, this is an expensive indulgence (for me) but one I'm glad I tried."
"I first tasted this sauce when I was visiting in Alaska.  It was served with fish tacos, and was the perfect combination of sweet and spicy.  I couldn't find it locally, so I ordered it from Amazon.  It's available for a reasonable price, and is wonderful with fish, pork and chicken.  I haven't tried it on beef, but not sure if it would be good or not.  It's also terrific on vegetables.  I highly recommend this product!"
They were as fresh as this kind of product can be. The kids I handed them to loved them and keep pestering me for more. Try Halloween you little locust!
"I purchased two of these for our labs at Christmas.  I filled them with their usual training treats, and the dogs loved them...they played with them for about 30 minutes trying to get to the treats.  Then...the two dogs figured if they bit off the ball on the end of the rope, they could get the treats to fall out sooner.  Yup...within 30 minutes the plastic ropes were destroyed.  It could really be a danger to dogs if swallowed.  (This is why I watch the dogs when they get new toys...and thank goodness I did.)<br /><br />Anyhow, totally disappointed with the product, it's safety and the price.  THESE TOYS ARE NOT LAB-TOUGH!"
I love the fact that there is turkey being offered. This is my son's 2nd favorite dish. No issues with it and a good balance of nutrients.
I have been searching and searching for a high end dog treat that one my dog would sniff and eat and two would eliminate or at least make bearable my dog's breath.  I am happy to say I found it in Old Mother Hubbard's Gimme A Kiss dog biscuits. He loves these biscuits and I now love his breath.  I noticed a change after the first biscuit. And as an added bonus the biscuits are made of all natural products.  I like knowing that my dogs diet is just as healthy as mine.
"This is a very nice product but Netrition has for the exact same item for one half of  the price,"
This is the best decaf around and it is Free Trade too.  We first found it when we were spending a week near Invermere and were thrilled to find it on Amazon.
"I had bought Pocky when on vacation and enjoyed it but living where there are no Asian stores I have to shop on the internet. The guys in the family seem to like it better than the ladies for some reason. For a bit of insanity, search for Pocky commercials on youtube!"
Product was timely delivered as advertised.  There is a wonderful selection of coffees which my clients and I are currently enjoying.  Will order again.
"This is by far the best K-cup hot cocoa we have tried.  It has a nice rich flavor and with the added convenience of a K-cup, it is easy to have a cup anytime you like. Highly recommend!"
"Very nice product.  It is not a Mounds bar, but it helps satisfy the urge."
"I read several great reviews on this coffee on another site and decided to give it a try. It's now one of my favorites and I will be ordering it again. The taste is great, sweet but bold enough that I can do a large size and it still have flavor."
"While this coffee is lower acid than a normal French roast, the flavor isn't quite as deep and rich as you'd expect from a French roast. French roast is typically my favorite type of roast. The aroma is nice after brewing, but smelling this coffee right out of the pack it smells plastic-like. Also, I found that this coffee had a quite strong bitter taste.<br /><br />Though, I did notice that this coffee did seem to be easier on my stomach. I'm sure this might work well for someone who loves coffee, but, has a sensitive stomach.<br /><br />Overall, a basic French roast nothing too spectacular. Might be good for someone who wants a low acid coffee who is willing to sacrifice the typical French roast depth of flavor. Though in my opinion this coffee is way overpriced as the flavor is lacking and it still manages to be bitter."
"The taste is great. The shipment came in fast. I love it, and so does my entire family. The beans are on the smaller side, but it does not matter to us."
"Greenies are an great product - they are very attractive to my dog, who can be picky about treats, and provide a good chew that helps address his tartar problems, and Amazon has among the best price I've found.<br /><br />As long as you have someplace out of dog-nose reach to store the box, Greenies are a great way to help your dogs teeth stay clean and thus avoid the further health issues that result from canine dental problems."
"I really wanted a decaf product so didn't have a lot of options. This powder essentially makes a chocolate flavored blended drink, even when I use cold decaf coffee or espresso as the ""base"", the chocolate is what you taste. When I think of an iced coffee drink, I think of coffee with a hint of chocolate (mocha) not the other way around.<br /><br />As other reviewers point out, the 150 calories is for half the packet and no milk added.<br /><br />I will try a different brand next time. I'm still on the hunt for a mix that creates the same flavor I've experienced once in a great while at a coffee shop. Or like the iced blended at a west coast chain (CB&TL) that is overpriced to have shipped (and I think is available sugar free)!"
"This peach raspberry instant oatmeal is excellent. It's pleasantly, not overwhelmingly, sweet. It has wonderful grains and textures. The peach and raspberry bits taste natural, not artificial. A hit with my 14-year old son and my college-age niece, who took several cups back to school with her. Highly recommended for a fast, nutritious breakfast."
"I found this product at my local Whole Foods for significantly less, which is shocking considering Whole Foods isn't exactly known for low prices - and I purchased in bulk on Amazon so the per unit price definitely should have been better.  Also, infant cereal is supposed to be 1/4 cup of dry cereal to 2 oz. of liquid, which is what it says on this container, but the cereal is way too thick when you make it like that.  The instructions say that 1/4 cup is 14 grams of cereal, which is not true; I weighed it myself and came up with about double that in grams.  So I have no idea whether the nutrition facts apply to the 14g or the 1/4 cup.  My daughter seems to like the cereal, though she definitely prefers the multigrain and oatmeal from this brand."
"Great chocolate, the italian is better than the german one but still all good!!! I will buy it again any time. It is simply great. You have to try it. ;P"
"We purchased the pretzels to make chocolate covered wedding favors for our guests. The pretzels would not have been bad for anything else, but there were way too many broken ones... we would have had to buy five more barrels. My only complaint now is that we shipped them back over a month ago and still haven't received our refund!"
"I received two cases of Petite Cusine from Amazon.com earlier this week. I figured that this would be an easy product to review. After all, what could possibly go wrong with cat food? I have a cat. He eats food. Seems simple enough.<br /><br />Well, here's the problem... My cat, who is well-known for eating just about anything, refuses to touch this stuff. From the rest of the reviews here, you would think that this was some sort of feline version of steak and lobster. My cat refuses to play along though.<br /><br />I guess that I can understand why my cat keeps staring at me with this puzzled look on his face. This is not ordinary cat food. At least not the batch I received. Even before I opened the can, I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be more liquid inside than solid. Sure enough, upon opening the can I found the contents to consist of a LOT, and I mean a LOT, of water. It has more of the consistency of soup than of ordinary cat food. If it were human food, you wouldn't be able to eat it with a fork. You would need a spoon, or maybe even a straw. This seemed to be the case with all of the varieties that I tested on my cat.<br /><br />My cat refuses to eat any of the many flavors of this food I have put in front of him. No, he's not sick, and he seems to have a quite healthy appetite for his regular dry food. I wish that I could come up with even a single positive thing to say about Petite Cusine. Nice looking box? That's about it."
"first, the good news:  YES, these are really good.<br />the bad news: They are loaded with monosodium glutamate<br />Of course, this wasn't listed on Amazon as one of<br />the ingredients.<br />This is a good item if you're not sensitive to<br />MSG--<br />Now I have to go to the 7-11 and buy the fried pork<br />rinds to feed my addiction."
I have had this toy for three months. My big dog loves plastic bottles and will assume every water bottle is meant for her so I was curious about how this toy would go over. It was a definite hit!  She loves it and ever after the beagle has tried to destroy it you can hardly see a mark on it!  At least as far as dogs are concerned I think this might be indestructible.
"This coffee tastes pretty good, and I like the fact that it's organic (coffee has one of he highest rates of pesticides).  However, each time I use Subscribe & Save, unfortunately, the price seems to get raised substantially a few weeks later, which is why I had to cancel my subscription to this."
"Thought this is Japan made and purchased at almost $25 for $2+ a pack, I had bought other brands in local stores for a lot cheaper, this is the worst bean thread I had so far. Wish I could return it. My experience with Amazon is always satisfied except when it came to grocery products. From now on I stop buying food online."
"I was excited to receive this coffee maker as a Christmas gift.  But after three weeks of use (1-2 cups per day), it started brewing partial cups.  I followed the troubleshooting instructions to get it working again, but now I find that after 4-5 cups brewed, it will brew a partial cup (about 4 oz), and quit with an error. This is very disappointing, not to mention the waste of a number of K-Cups.<br /><br />Based on other low ratings and comments, it looks like this model line has design problems."
"In years past, I have eaten instant oatmeal for a quick, easy, hot breakfast when I am in a hurry. I have eaten various flavors including the brown sugar and maple flavor that was offered here. I have to say that this is not the same product that I am used to from years past.<br /><br />The maple flavor was bland and chemically, and although it was sweet-ish, I really couldn't detect the flavor of brown sugar. It did, however, have a significant amount of sugars in it. When I reviewed the nutritional information I was stunned at just how much sugar was present in the package.<br /><br />In addition, the portion sizes are almost comical. There is no way that one packet will serve adequately as a meal for breakfast. It requires, at a minimum, two packets to make a bowl of oatmeal that is sufficient for an average adult male. That provides a significant amount of your daily intake of sugars.<br /><br />I was not enamored with this product, and would not go out of my way to buy it in the future. However, as part of a variety pack, I would probably have it on hand for those days when I desire oatmeal, but do not have the time to cook it from scratch."
"I was soooo disappointed by this product. They would not take! I guess I should have suspected from the low price. I had gotten fresh pablanos shortly before and they were WONDERFUL, but these are not. I know these are terribly hard to find ,thats why I took a chance, but do not waste your time on this product. (scoring & soaking will not help)"
"Although the kernels may not be as large and fluffy when popped, we really enjoyed our first pop. Has a great flavor and consistency.<br />We recommend using a hot air popper over a microwave. We had very few no-pops."
"This is my third order of Popchips.  My husband and I both love them, and he takes a bag in lunch nearly every day.  I shared them with coworkers, also, and they thought they were great.  You won't be disappointed."
"I have been giving my dog this treat for a long time,I found it here on Amazon and it is much cheaper! Now I learned that ALL chicken treats for dogs (and also cats I believe) that are MADE IN CHINA are being investigated  by the FDA because some dogs have died after consuming them. These treats and all Dogswell treats are made in China,I researched all over the web about this matter and bottom line is: why take the risk? A few sites say it is OK, most say to be cautious and others say don't buy.I threw out all the ones I bought and got new ones made in USA.I wish Amazon gave us the choice of ""made in USA"", for now I recommend everyone that has a pet to read the labels of the treats and food. Sorry this product, I don't recommend."
"Just a word of warning...This product is made in China where they may add a substance that can cause serious kidney problems in dogs. Read the blog on the topic of chicken dog treats made in China - [...]. After reading the many comments posted by dog owners who fed they dogs chicken treats made in China, I am discarding all of these treats and will seek an alternative product that is made in the USA."
"Unless you really really really like vinegar - AVOID! Those chips should have been called ""Vinegar and Sea Salt"" - not ""Sea Salt and Vinegar""."
"Yes, it's probably healthier than 5-Hour Energy or Starbucks shots but if you're looking to avoid a caffeine overload, this is still not for you. Most energy drinks cannot be made w/ out a high dosage of caffeine. I believe the caffeine content of 1 Guayaki shot is 150 mL - probably lower than other un-healthy energy shot drinks but I believe most other people avoid the top brands b/c they contain too much caffeine and/or sugar. If you do not react well to caffeine, Guayaki is not a good buy either. I definitely feel an energy boost w/ 1 full Guayaki shot but not w/ out all the other caffeine side effects - irritability, nervousness, mood-swings. Caffeine overdose is why I stopped drinking coffee. But it looks even organic energy drinks are still not safe.<br /><br />Now you're NOT sensitive to caffeine, then it's a great buy. It's not loaded w/ sugar. The taste is easy and pleasant. It's not loaded w/ a bunch of chemicals like 5-Hour shots or Starbucks drinks. And the energy boost lasts for about 4 to 5 hours. Takes about 5 to 7 minutes to kick in but all this probably depends on your body/weight.<br /><br />Side note - if you want to feel energized during the day, have a protein drink first thing in the morning and stay away for heavy, fattening foods during the day that will make you feel sluggish and sleepy!"
"My sister gave her cats these and loved them, so I got them for my cats. Our 4 cats have been vomiting a lot lately, and we traced it back to these treats. Google whiskas temptations recall...they were recalled not too long ago and I don't know why they are still on shelves. Don't buy these... They will make your cat sick and who know what else it's doing to their internal system. Please keep your cats away from this product!"
"Instead of a black graduation cap, a top hat was sent instead.  Not great for a graduation gift!  Also, I think any buyer should be aware that by ""Godiva 4 Pack"", they mean ""4 pieces of candy""!  Very confusing description especially when you consider that the picture shows at least 5 pieces of candy! Definitely not worth the price!!"
"The flavor of this natural sea salt is more nuanced and a bit richer than the typical table salt we're all accustomed to, although describing such subtleties is difficult.<br /><br />One noteworthy fact is that this salt contains less sodium than conventional table salt - 330mg per 1/4 teaspoon, versus 590mg per 1/4 teaspoon of conventional table salt.<br /><br />Another thing to keep in mind is that this natural salt is NOT iodized.  As our thyroid glands require trace amounts of iodine, it may not be wise to entirely eliminate iodized salt from your diet."
"It's probably my bad that I didn't see 'sugar' listed as one of the ingredients. I'm happy that this product is BPA free which I don't see many rice cereal explicitly saying that. If people want to feed sugar to their kids they can add separately, I just don't understand why they add sugar to this baby food. I haven't returned it yet but I will. I end up making my own rice cereal which I found how-to on the web. If anyone is interested, you can go to [...]"
My wife recently traveled on Delta and loved these Biscoff cookies they were serving. She asked me to order some for her online and I found a great price for them on Amazon. She has been very happy with the taste and high quality of these european style cookies. Her friends and relatives love them too. To tell you the truth I love them too.
"Hazelnut Decaf is absolutely delicious.  It is mellow, smooth, and not a bit bitter.  It is the one I am choosing for my daily basic coffee."
"My 9 1/2 month old daughter has loved this since she tasted it when she was 7 months.  I have tasted it, and it's delicious.  It's convenient for on the go or to have handy as a snack.  The ingredients are mangoes and &lt;1% Organic Lemon Juice.  The consistency is nice and thick (like that of apple butter) so it isn't dripping off the spoon.  Also if you feel confident enough, you or your child can squeeze it right in his/her mouth.  Ella's products are expensive, but I think their products are worth it, and my daughter has loved every variety we have tried except the pumpkin combo.  Love all the fruits--pears, apples and these mangoes.  This also provides 40% of Vitamin C."
"I really like Nantucket Blend.  I drink way too much!  So I thought I would buy the 96 ct. pack.  What a mistake.  I ordered 2 weeks ago, but the product has not arrived.  I checked my Amazon account and it said the product would ship between July and August.  Three to four months for shipping?  How very ridiculous.  I must say that this is my fault.  It clearly says that in the product listing.  However, I usually get everything I order from Amazon.com within a couple or three days, so I didn't even think to look.  Buy this coffee from another vendor, please."
These wafers taste incredible under normal circumstances but the six tins are a crumbled mess of smashed chocolate sticks. They should have written 'fragile' on the box. It's literally a pile of chocolate goo and crumbs. I will not order again...
"I cannot get my dog to use this no matter how hard I try.  My dog is the most food motivated dog I've ever known.  She will do ANYTHING for carrots, lettuce, ice cubes... even her own kibble.  But regardless of what I put in this thing, I cannot get her interested in this toy to save either of our lives.  I even tried clicker training her on it!  She doesn't associate it with food no matter what I do."
I love eating Chia Seeds and they are so filling I  put them in my oatmeal everyday. They help me with my digestive system!
I'm on a very low sodium intake- 300mgs per day- and these are great. Good taste and low sodium. I just put a little mustard on them and yum!
"This truffle oil is quite good but I prefer the Plantin brand, which is from France. The Urbani is from Italy. The Plantin is more expensive but it is oh so delicious. I have tried both black and white and both are good. Black is a bit stronger, or more pungent. In any event, this is a very healthy alternative to butter! Enjoy!"
"I'm training for my first marathon in November 2011 and these chews have kept me going during my long 18 to 20 mile training runs.  I dissolve them in water rather than carry them as chews and sip steadily after mile 8.  They taste like concentrated hawaiian punch and do not upset my stomach whatsoever.  I also eat them prior to a workout if I am feeling low energy and will even snack on them in lieu of candy.  Seriously, they are that good.  I have tried GU as well as Powerbar gels and both do the trick but are nowhere near as tasty.  The consistency of the chews are slightly softer than DOTs candy."
I received all containers previously opened - all seals were opened. On the top of containers was decent pieces of liver and below that were grisley pieces and a lot of powder on the bottom. I will never buy liver treats from Amazon again. BIG RIP-OFF!
Diamond glazed walnut's recipe is similar to Emerald's glazed walnuts and tastes just as good. Diamond walnuts cost less per pound than Emerald walnuts.
"We love Earth's best. Its hard to beat their variety of flavors and organic offerings. You can also buy a vegetable variety pack, gourmet meals, or my favorite, the seasonal! Good Price on Amazon too, especially if you do subscribe and save!!"
"This product that I recieved was old... My dogs turned their nose up at it... My dogs really love this when they are fresh... These must have been over 1 yr old... I can't believe that Amazon had sold these... Bad, Old, Products..."
"This is such a terrific product.  It's so easy. Pop it in the microwave and since we live on the run it is a great breakfast.  The maple brown sugar flavor is really tasty.  My son likes the apples and cinnamon too, but I prefer this one the best.  Just what you need on a cold day.  Of course hearty eaters will use two packets at a time, but even that won't be a disaster if you are worried about calories.  My father-in-law eats oatmeal to lower cholesterol, but this tastes so good you would never know it is so healthy."
THIS INDIAN COFFEE INDRIYA HAS WARMTH AND SPICE FOR A RICH PICK ME UP.  IT REMINDS ME OF WONDERFUL TIMES IN THE SOUTH OF INDIA
"Can't believe they are only 100 calories a bag and pack so much flavor! Tried them in NYC last week and of course can't find them where I live but thanks to Amazon.com I can get them whenever I want and at a great price too! The single bags were selling in NYC for $1.29 to $1.50 a bag. It's a lot cheaper buying the 24 pack here!<br />Looking forward to trying the other flavors, but so far Salt & Pepper are my favorite!"
"the after taste is very distinct.  i was looking forward to the raspberry for use in yogurt and soda, but the after taste is almost overpowering. the other flavors are not too bad in coffee but still very present.  even if you mix the irish creme with brandy, you notice it.  as far as i'm concerned these bottles go into the trash.  i won't use them and i sure would not offer them to my guests.  what a waste of money.  don't buy these!  and then the plastic bottles...  you can go to the torani site itself and buy individual bottles of your favorite flavor with a shipping for as many bottles you buy of 6.95.  this sugar-free stuff isn't even for the birds."
"Don't be hesitant to try this coffee because of the name. I was looking for a good MEDIUM ROAST-NON FLAVORED kcup and this is it. Just right for an everyday cup of coffee. No bitterness, and low acidity. Perfect coffee for adding your flavored liquid creamer. The brewed color/strenght is just like a regular pot of Community Coffee or Folgers."
"This product makes me want to buy a Miracle Fruit tree so I can have these awesome berries all the time.<br /><br />The biggest changes my husband and I noticed were in eating fruits & other berries. Store-bought strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, oranges, and green apples tasted like they were just picked off the plant/bush/tree at the height of ripeness. It was like being a kid again and biting into my first :)<br /><br />I didn't notice any change at all with anything bitter. Beers and coffees and teas tasted about the same. Spicy things like hot sauce tasted kind of gross. Savory things like noodles and meat got a slight hint of sweetness, but nothing THAT noticeable. Sweet things like candy and cake were made to be way too sweet to be palatable.<br /><br />Definitely make sure you get the tablet to slide all over your tongue, and don't chew -- leave it on your tongue until it dissolves.<br /><br />If you're a fan of sweet, succulent fruit, but can't get fresh produce from farmer's markets, do yourself a favor and try these. It's worth the price for the fun, at the very least :)"
"My wife's shop has a Keurig in her shop and she loved it.  She wanted to buy one and only went off visuals.  (It's black and had two cup sizes)  So to my happiness I found it on Amazon.  A taken aback was I after two weeks of backorder I finaly use at home.  In the instructions it says this is Keurig Classic B44.  Brews two cup sizes  SMALL AND SMALLER.  7.25 oz and 5.25 oz respectively.  So, it is great if you want to have tea with your imaginary friends and plastic Barbie china ware.  Not so great if you need it for your morning cup of Jose. Heck fire, it will not even fill up a normal sized travel mug / coffee cup.  I WOULD RECOMEND THE KEURIG ELITE B40 FOR PEOPLE WANTING TO HAVE THEIR COFFEE CLOSER TO AMERICAN PROPORTIONS.  The B40 will brew 10.25 oz.<br /><br />This Classic B44 is a waste of K Cups; I will not reccomend to anyone other than for tea conasewers.  At least Amazon steeped up to the plate and gave me a gift card refund so I can purchase the correct one.  Thanks Amazon!  Boo Keurig Classic (thumbs down)."
So easy to use. No measuring just open the bag and dump everything in.  The combination of all the ingredients makes this popcorn so delicious.
I don't care for Bigelow's version of their Spiced Chai. They don't list their ingredients on the box - but this definitely has something strange in it. I bought it because I couldn't find my regular brand - but I'll be giving these away. :(
"great, taste like always and is as good as ever.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Nice, wonderful, awesome. Fantastic, fun, wow!<br />  Make it fun! Who says you can't be informative and entertaining?<br />  How about a little action? If it makes sense, cut to the product in use as you describe your experiences with it."
"I enjoy a cup of hazelnut coffee on occasion, so this is a nice coffee to enjoy - GOOD taste!  It is at the top end of the price I will pay per each, but almost all K-Cups have been outrageous in their price increases lately."
Do not buy this if you think this will substitute your current uses of PB. I love PB found nothing this mixes with well or betters the taste. I Iove Amazon but ask these 5* ratings be investigated and following up that my review remains published.
Easy to follow directions. The grass grew fast and strong. My dogs are eating it right now and I know it safe and healthy!
"Initially, this product was priced fairly ($15.51 for 12 cans) and a quality product.  No dented cans noted.  However, it should be noted that the price hiked 150% in 1 month.  Regardless of the current economy, what was a fair price, quickly became ridiculous. I will not purchase this product again."
"After purchasing a few bags and receiving just crumbs, I wrote to the company.  No offer to replace, no refund and most important not even a thank you for taking the time to let them know; just that they will try and fix the problem.  I am sure the flavor is quite good but they were literally just smashed crumbs. And expensive crumbs at that.  In this economy, I tend to stay away from people/companies that don't stand behind their product."
I just threw out $25 worth of this and other flavors I bought from another company online. I bought because of the good reviews right here. I remember horehound being stout and an acquired taste. This brand barely has any flavour at all. If you want real horehound look elsewhere.
These are just great overall treats that my dog loves. Easy to break apart to make them last longer. My cats like them too.
"Slate Magazine has a review on table salts and this was the winner.  So I ordered some from Amazon and compared it myself to the brands available where I live, including Celtic Sea Salt.  There is no comparison... Maldon is the standout winner. It is big flaky, crunchy pieces of very tasty salt.  This is not a baking salt.  It is more of a finishing salt to go ""on"" foods.  It's wonderful on avocado, steamed yellow squash, baked potatoes... etc.  The Slate reviewer said he loved it the best on chocolate H&auml;agen-Dazs ice cream!  It's that good."
"I admit, I am not terribly fond of flavored coffees. But, this one is not for us. We both love the Rodeo Drive. I have a good freind that loves this coffee. I sent her ours."
We like these chips for salsa and quacomole better than any other cips on the market. They are even great by themselves. We will order these as long as they are available. Thank you for making them accessable.<br /><br />  Shelly Kenyon
"I recently received a Kuerig Coffee Maker  and realized that the coffee cups would be a costly add on to the product. DisposaCups came to the resue. These durable cups can be filled with your own coffee rather than the expensive Kuerig cups. My only issue with these cups is that when I fill them to save for later use, the tops do not stay on snuggly. Hope they work on this."
"mackerel is a healthy fish..full of omega 3 fatty acids..yet these have no ""fishy taste""..delicious as a snack or as part  of a meal..these are small fish (not king mackerel) and therefore should be low in mercury..highly recommended.."
My whole family is addicted to this tea.  We make it in our Mr. Coffee Iced Tea Maker - it's fabulous!
To be fair only one of my twins got gas from this but it was horrible. Up all night screaming from gas pains. Garbanzo beans are not an ideal food for young babies.
"I love chia, but I have gotten two different packages of this brand that were rancid.  The expiration dates were over a year away.  Amazon doesn't allow food returns, and Navitas said I would have to ship them the seeds for them to check before they would send me new ones.  I will still enjoy chia, but I'll avoid this brand from now on."
"I returned them, they made my dogs sick (diarrhea). They used to eat them all the time. Guess their stomachs couldn't handle it as they got older."
"These truly are a superior dog treat. I have two small dogs and they are spoiled and picky when it comes to treats. They love these. Newman's Own brand is so much better than the bland dog treats that my poor dogs have always been subjected to in the past. These are high quality, and that is obvious when I see the way my dogs respond to these treats. They smell good, look good, and break easily if you just want to give them a half. As my dogs usually take a treat and lick it a few times and drop it in a corner, these were actually eaten with enthusiasm."
"This popcorn is the best. Say goodbye to movie theater popcorn,and hello to great northern popcorn. My boyfriend, and I pop 2 bags a day. It is so good, that as soon as you finish eat it, you want more. It has enough salt, a buttery taste, and oil. Everything is packaged together. I love it. I'm order more today! I use to go to the movie theaters just to get the popcorn, and leave and eat it at home. I am a popcorn critic in my head, and this is definitely Top 2."
"I love Pop Chips!  They are similar to a regular potatoe chip, but lighter though just as crunchy!!  I say give them a try -- they are definitely worth it!"
Dunno where the alleged 6 Pack went. I received ONE 2lb box of biscuits.  Don't be misguided by false advertising.  On another IAMS order from another supplier received what I had ordered.
"I think it is going to take an amazing coffee to get me away from my Folger's classic roast and the occasional Eight O'Clock vanilla.  However, I understand that this coffee is meant for those who probably do not enjoy the aforementioned brands so keep that in mind when making your own coffee choices in life."
"This is the worst tasting cups of coffee I've had in quite some time. I've had generic instant decaff coffee that tastes better. I don't know if it's their roasting technique, the quality of the beans themselves or the de acicification process, but it leaves you with a very bland tasting cup o'Joe. I was hoping I'd finally found a way to have caffeine again but I guess I'l have to stick with the decaff."
Put these sprouts on a sandwich and it becomes a gourmet meal. They last a long time in the fridge too. I am a customer for life. I just wish they made a bigger quantity to buy.
"My wife and I decided that we wanted to begin having miso soup for dinner on a more regular basis, so purchased this tofu as an essential ingredient for my miso soup recipe. I was totally impressed with the individual packaging of the tofu (and the fact that it doesn't need to be refrigerated), the taste and texture, and the overall product quality. Needless to say, I am reordering and will continue to do so. I want to say that my picky kids also love this tofu as well -- for kids that seem to only want mac & cheese, they are gorging themselves on (much healthier) miso soup now. This makes me happy. By the way, I also highly recommend the Roland White Miso Paste (incredible flavor and great quality) and the Ajinomoto Hon Dashi Soup Stock which I both purchased from Amazon.  If interested, my Miso Soup recipe is as follows: 1 package of Morinu firm silken tofu (this stuff), 2 tsp Dashi soup stock, 3 TBS white miso paste, 4 cups of water and 2 chopped scallions -- we also reconstitute shitake mushrooms, add dried wakame seaweed (highly recommend either Eden or Emerald Cove from Amazon as well), add shaved daikon, etc. However, this recipe is awesome just as is... We live in Northern California with some of the best Japanese restaurants in the world, but this recipe blows away (or at least equals) what you can get from any restaurant. But I digress... I highly recommend this tofu!"
"So far I've tried all of the flavors and while there are some I'm not over the hill about, I've had pretty good experiences with them.<br /><br />This is one of the flavors I'd purchase again. I'm a big fan of anything lemon or lime flavored, so I had to give this a try. I'll admit up front that I haven't had a key lime pie for years, so I don't remember the flavor like it was yesterday and this probably worked in my flavor. (I remember it in general, though.)<br /><br />This tastes awesome. I can definitely taste the lime and it tastes like what I remember a key lime pie to be. The lime flavor is there, but it's backed up by a nice creamy taste that almost made me want to grab a few extra slices of gum. (Hey, it's 15 calories a slice so I can splurge on this while I wouldn't want to splurge with the actual pie.) Unfortunately it falls prey to the same problem that the equally yummy apple pie flavor had: the flavor doesn't last nearly long enough.<br /><br />I'll absolutely buy this again, despite the flavor only lasting 1-2 minutes."
"Stonewall products, although pricey, are very good. High quality products with high taste value. Vendor rated very high. Product arrived early, and well packaged."
I did not enjoy this soup; I will try a different brand next time.
This Mesquite Lime flavor is so horrible! Please spare yourself from the disgusting mouth experience. The other flavors are pretty good. This is like some nasty fake lime flavor that is super overwhelming. Am I eating Lemon Pledge or something? Couldn't finish one bite. Hope I don't chuck.
"When I saw the Switch Orange Tangerine was available, I knew I had to try it.  I liked the Kiwi Strawberry quite well (better than some other reviewers did, it seems), so I was sure I would enjoy this one just as much.<br /><br />The initial taste of this Orange Tangerine carbonated juice is rather tart, and the carbonation just seems to make it more tart.  The aftertaste is rather pleasant, so if the aftertaste is what you're looking for in a drink, this is the drink for you.  My wife thought it tasted a bit like champagne, if that's any indication of what to expect from this drink.<br /><br />The flavor is different, and not at all what I expected.  Not very refreshing at all.  I would buy the Kiwi Berry drink, but I think I'll take a pass on the Orange Tangerine in the future."
"Both my dogs love these treats.  They are a bit pricey if you have an aggressive chewer.  However, they are great and the dogs go crazy for them."
Give it a bit of sun and water and watch it grow. All of the Hirsh plants are great.
"Consistency - good.<br />Value - bad.<br />Taste - not good, but bearable.<br />Smell - awful.<br /><br />I think I'll try the natural PB rather than resort to this expensive, stinky, messy powder.  If it were cheap, maybe I'd force myself to eat it, but there's no way I'm paying a premium for this stuff.  I am trying to find ways to cut back on fat & calories, but this isn't going to be it.  I was actually surprised at how bad I thought it was considering all the glowing reviews."
I always get the white chocolate with mixed nuts that tastes fantastic so this was on sale so I gave it a try. Terrible taste.
The crisps are awesome. Give me English crisps over american chips any day! I recommend them to everyone. The smoky bacon are my favorite but the cheddar bacon are almost as good.
I bought these for my girlfriend on her birthday along with some flowers and she loved them.  She liked them so much that I had to get her another order when she was done!  I also liked that they had the option to pack with ice packs because I ordered in the summer and didn't want them to be melted when they arrived.  I am very happy with the product... as is my lovely lady :)
I received this product with an expiration date for last April. Didn't work well. The yeast didn't activate. I am very disappointed with this product.
"Unfortunately, Made in China. I do not trust their manufacturing standards.  Looking for an alternative...."
My dog loves this flavor. Quality of cookie overall is very good. This particular smell drives him crazy!! On Amazon I get much chipper than in a store.
"I like almost everything about this jerky, the toughness and chewiness. But it is just too salty. If you nibble it, you may enjoy it but that is not how i eat. Also, it is not good for my health to eat something this salty. I have run into too many of salty beef jerky patches recently. This review is for the wood smoked, but if other flavors contains the same amount of salt per serving, they will be just as salty. Why everything is either too fatty, sweet or salty??? Are they trying to get us addicted?"
"Great product, I never cook this in the microwave because sometimes it takes longer and not all microwaves are the same.  I've read people reviews and they said there were small brown pieces that were hard, that means they were not cooked long enough.  The best way to cook these are to use a medium size pan, pour the pack into the pan and shake it around and bake them in the oven @ 400 degrees for 4-6 minutes, keep a close eye on them because they burn easy.  But it is worth it to cook it in the oven, very hot and fresh and no uncooked curls.  They will appear to be brown at first but they ""poof"" up in the oven once they're heated.  I would say do not microwave these in a bag, use a oven safe plate, that way you can actually see them puff up, older/cheap microwaves can take 4-6 minutes to cook."
"My cat will go for a day, probably longer, haven't tryed it, but he'll walk right by this stuff every time, even when I know he's hungery. ABSOLUTELY NO INTEREST. I swear he'd rather die of starvation then even take a wiff of it!!"
"This was perfect for my purposes! I made a personalized ""funfetti"" cake for a bridal shower for a girl whose colors were hot pink and black, and this was awesome to get it done! Fast shipping too!"
These cost 69 cents a box in any grocery store.  $9 for just one 7oz package?  How can this listing be serious?
My Dog loves Dogswell Happy Hips duck breast strips.  I put a couple in his kong ball and he plays and plays.  One of his favorite treats.  good for him and not fattening.
"This is the worst chocolate I have ever had. It tastes like anything but chocolate, just a very weird unpleasant taste. I had a piece and threw it in the trash. It only cost a dollar and it was a dollar too much."
My dogs loved them. I'm not sure if it's helped their hips at all.<br />But I'll keep giving them the chicken strips to find out.
"Sent this as a gift, and found out later that many items were stale.  They loved the thought, though, and loved the way it looked."
"I really like it when my wife makes anything from her Betty Crocker cookbook, so I know when we got the gluten free pancakes that they would be good.  They are not overly dry like some of the other brands of gluten free pancakes.<br /><br />We usually have them with earth balance butter spread, and sliced bananas or sliced strawberries, chopped pecans or walnuts and maple syrup.  They are great."
"We have a 3 year old Maltese that we used to shower with Greenies (1-2 a day) even though it says to limit them to one per day.  The last time we took him to the vet, we told her what kind of food he's on and what kind of treats he gets.  She was concerned with the amount of Greenies he gets and told us to limit them to one every other day.  She said that Greenies contain wheat and that could be problematic for dogs later on in life.  So I searched on Amazon for a wheat free dental chew...<br /><br />Our dog has tried three different kinds of dental chews (including this one) and likes them all.  He's tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001G96UK8"">Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Teenie Pack, 96 Chews</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001MWRT18"">Zuke's Z-Ridge Mini - Carrot Fresh Breath Dental Chew Bones, 15 Count Pouch</a>.<br /><br />After reading mixed reviews, I decided to give these a try.  My first impressions were that these were pretty large for a ""small"" dog.  They are twice the length of a Greenie.  When our little guy got one, he ate half of it, then tried to hide the other half.  He did like it though.  I will say that he usually devours his Greenies but he takes his time on these (he did the same with the Zukes at first).  After a few days, he seems to really like them.<br /><br />If you're doing a side by side comparison between the Get Naked dental chew, Greenies and Zukes,  I think these are better.  They're really low in calories and they're wheat free, corn free, soy free and gluten free.  They're cheaper than Zukes as well.<br /><br />My recommendation is to cut them in half.  That will give you 36 treats for your dog per bag.  Three bags will give you 108 treats vs. Greenies 96 at around the same price.  He likes the Zukes but they are just too expensive seeing how you only get 15 per bag.<br /><br />I suggest buying one bag to see if your dog likes them.  If they do, then they are a great alternative to Greenies."
"Just like at the movie theater. A little salty if you add all of the ""butter salt"". I just wish it was more buttery tasting."
"Not the sweet clam taste I was expecting. The product is sort of grayish and dirty looking, not fleshy pink as I expected. The average very small clam size is about 3/8"" inch with many in pieces or crushed like mush. Occasional pieces of hard elements such as shell bits or something else that is hard. Somewhat of an off flavor, sort of fishy or sea weedy. A product of China which I was suspect of at the start as I think their quality control often suffers with many products and I was right. I would not recommend this product."
"So after comparing this to Jay Robb, I can say that this protein is not as good. The taste isn't as good, and it doesn't mix that easy. I don't think it is horrible, just not that good.<br /><br />One thing I like about the Jay Robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs. I sent Healty N' Fit an email asking where they get their eggs from, but they didn't reply. It is a little cheaper, but I found the Jay Robb at Vitamin Shoppe for 20 per 12ozs, which isn't bad. I have to say that I don't like the dudes picture on the bottle, but that's my only complaint."
These sprinkles make a great presentation and are tasty too!  Used them for my french chocolate balls.  Would recommend them highly.
I received the package today. It is so not worth the money. Definitely should not an will not buy this one.
"For a microwavable meal, it's great. The meat is indeed a mystery, but expected for the price. If it had higher quality meat, we'd be complaining about the price increase for the product.<br />If you're looking for a cheap, quick alternative meal at work, this works nicely. Add some sour cream and eat it alongside rice for a more fuller meal.<br />I'd prefer a home cooked chili, but who has the time to shop/prepare it when working over 40hr/wk. I've had worse chili in restaurants for much more.<br />I just purchased Campbell's Firehouse Hot and Spicy Chili because I do prefer some heat. Will review them later this week when I receive my shipment."
"Libby's Pumpkin filling was not available in our area (maryland) and through a search Amazon.com helped us by suggesting a replacement of ""Farmer's Market Foods"" canned pumpkin.......<br /><br />One might ask why is pumpkin so important...We have a rescue pet dog since nov 2009 that has a tablespoon of pumpkin mixed in with his dry food and it provides regularity for him.......He is neither constipated or has dyeria.......<br /><br />Thank you<br /><br />Roger Evans"
"I bought these for my boyfriend who really likes honey roasted pecans in salads that I have at a couple of restaurants. Plus, he likes nuts, pecans, almonds peanuts. He loved these. I actually ordered 3 cans instead of the gift tin, so he could take one to work, or his place, and stay fresh longer. Although I don't think freshness will be an issue, they won't last long......lol"
"This oatmeal is extremely filling and has a hearty consistency, impressive for an instant oatmeal, I know.<br /><br />The flavor is somewhat bland, which allows one to be creative with add-ins! (I prefer to add raisins, dried cranberries, and/or cinnamon to mine).<br /><br />The nutritional information is great, especially the plant derived Omega and added whole flax seeds, but I wish there was less added sugar in it though.<br /><br />All in all, I am happy this is my breakfast every morning, as I get myself off to a healthy start each day!"

Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"" or ""happy bowels"" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

"I did not care for this product at all, I thought it was the same tea my sisters and I use to drink when we were in elementary school. I found out the tea we use to drink actually came from the root of a particular type of tree."
"Love Calif Natural venison dry.  Prior to this, had to run to vet for anal gland problems.  Since switching to venison, no more problems. No more loose stools or anal gland cleaning.  Thank you Calif. Natural.  Dog loves it and I'm real happy."

"For canned soup this is very good clam chowder.  Those who give it 1 or 2 stars are comparing it to homemade soup or restaurant style soup.  I would buy this any day over other brands.  You can tell it is all natural and without loaded msg, salt and other nasty ingredients.  Pure and clean soup.  Those who rate it badly, some say it has no flavor or there aren't chunks in it.  The flavor is mild, but that is good- not overwhelmingly clammy and not over salted like conventional brand canned soup.  If I want to, next time I will add a potato cut up in chunks to boost it's contents- not a big deal to do.  I would prefer to do that than buy a conventional brand that doesn't care about healthy ingredients and sourcing of ingredients.  I will buy this again- good source of iron as well."
This was mostly sauce with 5 ravoili in it. I counted them! I guess I'm luckier than the reviewer who had maggots in theirs though. To top it off I hate the lid system. To hard for me to get the darn lids offs. Cut my finger once on the plastic lid. I'll stick to the canned ravoili. That is good & you get something to eat.
I saw that some folks had problems with damaged cans but many more gave good reviews so I took the risk.  Turns out that 5 out of the 12 cans were dented...and I mean severely dented.  And those were all packed in the center of the shrink wrapped flat so as to hide the dents unless the can was unpacked.  I haven't tried the good product; I'm sure it's fine tasting since I like Chef Boyardee products.  I am very disappointed in Amazon's attempt to hide the damaged cans though.  There is no way those cans were damaged in shipping...the box was perfect.  This was deliberate concealment of damaged goods.
This is the most convenient and best way to make coffee when in a hurry or when you live by yourself. Also this coffee has such a large variety of coffee flavors where you will not get bored. And if you prefer to use your own grounds you can still do so if you buy the additional coffee filter accessory. All in all great coffee maker.
"I loved these snacks.  The bags are easy to grab and go.  Makes a nice sweet, but good for you snack.  They aren't chewy like dried apples usually are, more like Apple Chips.  If you're looking for a healthy crunchy treat, check these out!"
I'm a bit perplexed wondering what void in the beverage market this is intended to fill.  Imagine a super sweet slightly carbonated juice drink with an almost syrupy consistency and you have The Switch.  I had to drink a tall glass of water after drinking a can of this carbonated candy in a can because it's anything but refreshing.
I am addicted to Popchips - I love the cheddar flavored ones. I don't crave cheetos anymore which I was addicted to.  I know eat a bag of these and my craving is gone. They are actually healthy and for only 100 calories a bag and around 3 grams of fat - it is a much better choice than cheetos. They are very crunchy and full of flavor. I am ordering these again.
"We started off our dog with Zuke's Mini treats as puppy rewards. Now that she is bigger, she needs more. These natural treats fit easily inside her kong toys and in the middle of her everlasting treat balls and give her something different. We recommend Zuke's to everyone. My dogs love them and they are made without corn fillers or by-products, which are 2 things I check for when purchasing any treats."
do not fed your dog any happy hip = dogswell product - it is not safe - google it<br />if your dog has eaten them regularly have the vet do blood work
"I have tried several different types of sugar-free chocolates and this is one of the worst.  Instead, I recommend the Dove dark chocolate and the Russell Stover coconut."
"just a quick note to let people know this is an excellent tasting, low calorie chip and love ordering these individual sized bags. I'm a 10-year plus Weight Watcher still maintaining my weight loss, and thanks to products like these that do not taste at all like ""diet"" food, I can enjoy all my cravings..one slight problem, my husband loves them too, and so now we have to order more!! :-)"
I am an avid coffee drinker and I was very pleased with the taste of this coffee. It was not as strong as other coffees and just left behind a really great french roasted taste. It also did not leave an after taste
"Green Mountain ""Nantucket Blend"" K-Cups make a very good cup of coffee in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AQPMHA"">Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System</a>.

"I've been using this product for almost a week now. Though I haven't a true Lucid Dream with it (yet!), I have noticed how much more vivid my dreams have become. I use about 2 droppers full in my cup of tea before bed (1/2 hour to 45 minutes prior to lying down), have no problems getting to sleep within 10-15 minutes, and wake up fully rested with no side effects whatsoever. I have been trying to compile my own dream dictionary for the past couple of years, but tend to have a hard time remembering most of the details from my dreams. Not a problem, since I've started using this product. If you're trying to get more out of your dreams, DEFINITELY give this product a try."
These sprouts tasted great together and my family loves them too! We put it on our salad and sandwiches.
I really wanted to like this coffee but it was bland and did not remind me of any French Roast I've ever had. It was smooth.  We put in our solofil K cups and think the grind was too fine for the machine.
"This _was_ my favorite chamomile tea, but they have changed the formula to now include licorice root and vanilla.  Very disappointed.  Now I have six packs of a tea that I don't really want."
"I wanted to get some jerky and since I like buffalo wings I tried these. The problem is there is way too much salt, it's disgustingly salty, way more than normal jerky. I can barely eat it. If you eat a 3.25 oz package of these you will have eaten 1840mg of sodium, instant high blood pressure."
As a vegetarian this item fulfilled my need for protein and also for something that resembles meat.  It's a great snack.
"Fabulous taste, almost seems like its flavored. Would highly recommend for the coffee connesseiur. Too expensive though. extra words to get to 20"
"I dont have a drip coffee machine so I am putting this into the espresso machine for 2 shots. Tastes about same. I guess it's good for stomach? But don't we use milk to sooth the stomach anyways? cream? and sugar. I guess this means we are going to let go of our sugar and creme that we are so used to from strong coffee taste? Less coffee is answer I suppose. This is great idea for low acid coffee but I just add water on half the amount of regular coffee and add normal amount of creme or sugar and milk and add water to the regular coffee's half portion to make it diluted. That helped so far. You are also supposed to drink this with coffee cake or something to help pass it. Not straight without anything in it unless you love that. I suppose you dont like to put any creme or milk in it then, it would make sense. This didn't make sense to me even while trying it. It just wasn't tasting right for me to drink it without any other sugar and creme I am used to drinking with. So I would say I wouldn't try it again without my condiments. But, I would definitely recommend to my mother who drinks straight black coffee. But she stopped drinking suggesting coffee is bad even weak coffee. She gets these ideas from her friends. She said it was good until last year and she's 60 years old. Now she says all coffee is evil. Dad still drinks black straight coffee from drip coffee machine (they are Koreans as I am). All their friends all drink straight black coffee without milk because they are all lactose intolerant. My younger brother is too. I guess this coffee is for those who has lactose intolerant condition and also loves to drink straight black coffee. Where coffee like this is served? Church. All dad's friends are also going to Roman Catholic Church. That's where it'd be best served. They brew like 5 gallons of these stuff every day. Straight black. Just wasn't for me but it's great idea for my parents who lives 1400 miles away so I couldnt just have them try it."
"Since going primal (see here is you don't know what I'm talking about:  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0982207700"">The Primal Blueprint: Reprogram your genes for effortless weight loss, vibrant health, and boundless energy (Primal Blueprint Series)</a>), I've been abstaining from gluten and eating out, which means I'm cooking a whole lot more than I ever did before.  It also means I'm avoiding packaged foods, such as mayonnaise, which is actually how I found avocado oil and what prompted me to purchase this product.  (This stuff makes FANTASTIC homemade mayo!  Buy it!  Try it!)<br /><br />I've never particularly liked the taste of extra virgin olive oil (it has a bitter taste to me) and it should not be used to cook at high temperatures as the smoke point is about 405 degrees F.  Avocado oil, on the other hand, has a subtle aroma and taste and a HIGH smoke point of about 520 degrees F, making it useable for pretty much anything.  I use it for salad dressings, marinades, and cooking (with the exception of deep frying - I don't deep fry anything).  With the exception of some specialty oils, such as walnut oil and truffle oil, this is the only oil I keep in the house anymore.<br /><br />A note on packaging:  When I purchased this through Amazon, both of the cans were dented.  Since I drain the oil into a tinted glass oil drizzler, that didn't bother me but FYI to those who might be.  I've found these at my local TJ Maxx many times and the cans have never been dented, so check there if you just want to give avocado oil a try or you need an unblemished can."
"I worked with my dogs on this toy for several days. Using it as an interactive toy we played tug, and the rubber stopper became wedged tightly so that it sealed the hole, trapping the kibble inside. The goodies inside would only fall out when the rubber stopper and straw was in a very specific position, AND the straw-like piece had grabbed the treat and pulled it through the hole, AND the bottle had to be upside down. This was something that my dogs could not possibly do with their mouth, tongue, and feet. They would pick it up by the rubbery end, sniffing and chewing at the rubbery purple parts, making it impossible to use gravity to allow the tiny treats to fall out, let alone accomplish the amazing ""straw grabber"" feat described above. Of course with no reward the motivation waned. Even my highly intelligent dog got frustrated and then became indifferent. After I had left the room for 10 minutes, my other dog had chewed up the purple rubber stopper and straw, and transformed the already useless toy into just a bottle with a small hole and no rubber stopper. Don't waste your money. I'm not impressed with the other two toys (by this maker) that I bought: busy bouncy bone, and busy bristle bone. (see my other reviews)"
"It's high-quality and the price is right, especially with subscribe-and-save via Prime, but after months of trying to keep up with my subscription, I had to put it on hold.  I'm not a big water drinker, but this stuff has a distinct flavor and when you're using it as a work-out beverage four or five times a weak it eventually wears on you.  Or me, at least. I'd still recommend it, just don't OD the way I did."
"A good cup of hot chocolate...with a couple of marshmellows.  Make it for my daughter every time she visits. She is nearly 60, and she loves it."
Discovering I have a yeast allergy meant I had to quit eating Munchos--a childhood favorite. Hurray!! These are very similar and just as good. :)
"Speaking as another Texan, I think the first rule for these delicious treats is to NOT order them during spring or summer. In fact, your safest bet is to ONLY order them in the dead of winter.  LOL!  As long as you do that, be prepared for a truly amazing treat!  This package comes with 12 bite-sized delicacies.  The chocolate is high-quality, the nuts are crunchy, and the overall taste couldn't be better.  Definitely worth the price!"
"The second you open the bag, you can tell these dog treats are quality. There's actually an aroma to them -- not like a delicious gourmet aroma, but still, they smell like actual baked food instead of smelling like pressed carboard / sawdust, which is sorta what I think when I smell cheapo dog treats.<br /><br />My small dog (Cavalier King Charles) loves these treats, but the problem is, they're almost too hard for him to eat. He has the small teeth and 'soft mouth' characteristic of his breed and has trouble crunching these up. It's actually a good thing, because it forces him to 'savor' the treats (AKA they last longer), but it's something to consider if your dog is old/missing teeth.<br /><br />Other than that, these treats are great. I don't always buy Newman's Own products, but know when I do that I am purchasing quality products from an ethical company."
"The only difference I can see between using this blend and using brown sugar is that you don't get the usual ""sugar rush"" when you eat the result.  Cookies and pies made with this Splenda blend - which does contain some sugar - taste the exactly the same as they did before.  Great stuff!  And it's gluten-free too."
"I didn't like these at all.  These ""dried"" fruits (more like sopping wet with oil...and not just this brand) are far too oily.  I don't want sunflower oil fruit globs.  It's actually disgusting.  Hate to give something a terrible review, but it's just yuck. I like oil fine, where it belongs (french fries, maybe a salad?), but not in dried fruit.  They've managed to get rid of the sulphur and whatever else just to jam them full of sunflower oil (a preservative).  I'd rather just have the fruit dried, in a fruit drier, or sun dried.  I'd even rather the things just crumble to dust in my mouth than this.  Organic or not, it's just oily junk food."
Ordered this great tasting rice combo on Oct 23 and it was delivered on<br /><br />Oct 25th.  Love Amazon's speed.  The rice combo is excellent.  Easy to cook and stands by itself on the dinner plate.  Rice is still a carbo but it taste great and has the extra minerals and vitamins already.  A nice change from white potatoes.
A recent trip to Mexico introduced me to this tasty seasoning dificult to find in local markets.<br /><br />Good on all kinds of meats includin seafood. Amazing on halibut steaks and even turkey.<br /><br />Amazon.com is an amaziing resource for hard to find items.
This is the best gum!  I'm soo sad I can't find it in stores around here any more!
"I am an East coast transplant living in Indianapolis and have a hard time finding quality pasta sauces.  After trying almost all that was offered here, I decided to try this, and am so glad I did.  It is so good, almost as good as mine, but I don't have the time to cook sauce all day.  I add a few ingrediants like Romano cheese and spices, but you don't have to add anything to it.<br />I have a feeling that my store will not be carrying this too much longer as I am the only one buying it, so I am glad to see that Amazon has it for me.  Thank you so much Amazon!!!  You scored a big one with this product."
"So fun and great price. This was one of our party favors at my son's birthday party. HUGE hit! I will buy again for the baseball team and group outings. The box is just like the good ol' days, although I remember the prizes were better back then (or maybe my expectations were lower since I was 10)."
I can eat this straight from the can.  It needs no other additives to make it delicious!!
"This stuff is pure, natural, creamy goodness. Perfect for using in recipes and for eating straight out of the tub!"
"Great on popcorn, fruit, veggies, meat, sandwiches, and pretty much everything else. It adds a zing without being overly spicy or salty unless you go overboard.<br /><br />My only complaint is that eight 5oz bottles is A LOT of spice shake mix. In 6 months I've gone through about one bottle. I don't think this stuff is going to go bad anytime soon, but it's going to take up cupboard space until 2015."
"This is the nastiest fresh mixer by Healthy Choice I have had. I still have the taste in my mouth and want to vomit. The water chestnuts add nothing but vegetable content, and the teriyaki sauce is disgusting. I didn't purchase it from amazon but from a regular grocery store. Do not buy! I recommended the sweet and sour chicken though :)"
This is really the next best thing to homemade pasta; especially Artichoke pasta which is very expensive to make. This is also a much healthier pasta than the average with 28g protein per half pound box. It's just amazing the flavor in this dish - when served simply with olive oil and garlic you can really get the flavor of an artichoke with the contrast of bitter taste and sweet aftertaste. Likewise it stands up to a full red or white sauce also.<br /><br />1 disclaimer: by no fault of the pasta manufacturer Amazon once sent me a box of pasta that had passed it's expiration date so just make sure to check the lot date on the side of the box and the end of all the individual packets.
"Ok. If you don't want to get addicted, don't try Plocky's Red Beans and Rice Tortilla Chips! My husband and I started with one seemingly anodyne bag from a store. Now, we've just received our second case. It won't last long. Beware."
"I don't think I've ever eaten anything drier than these cookie bars, ever in my life. They taste okay, but I just can't choke them down, even with coffee."
"I used to be a buyer at a natural/organic grocery.  This is the best soup I have ever had in a can.  I am very picky about my clam chowder soup as my favorite is The Ritz Carlton's clam chowder.  Just add butter, milk/cream, and black pepper.  Have some fresh corn bread and butter and you are in heaven."
"I am so glad that this hot chocolate is available for Keurig.  Previously the brand of hot chocolate available was only so-so, but this is definitely better.  The variety pack is just right for every mood and every guest.  I never find myself with too much of any one flavor left over.  Move over coffee lovers, we cocoa drinkers have found a home!"
These K-cups arrived in a timely fashion but when I've tried using them at all 3 size settings none of them are strong enough. It seems there is not enough coffee in them. I wrote a complaint to Van Houtte and they did not respond...So I've got nearly 50 cups that when brewed smell like chocolate raspberry but taste like water. Not happy.
"I am not on a gluten free diet. However, I find gluten free foods more filling. And so, I gave these crackers a try, after coming across them in my grocery store. I like the original and cheddar flavours the best (the cheddar flavour is very delicate).<br /><br />1) I have not experienced the breakage problem some mention. Yes, there is a broken cracker here and there, but nothing out of norm. Quite frankly, I think they pack them as they do, in two pouches, two servings each, in order to pump up the volume, so to speak. Each of these boxes contains only four servings (32 crackers). That's not much for the price. This is the only reason for the four, rather then five star rating.<br />2) They are filling and tasty. I am addicted to these crackers with red pepper humus. Yum! They scoop well once you get a hang of it (they are flaky and will break more often then regular crackers would in the same situation).<br />3) The box is made of 100% recycled material, for those to whom this matters.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />PS: There is a warning on the label that says they may contain traces of soy, milk, and sesame, in case anyone is alergic. Also, they do contain eggs."
This coffee is equivalent to Pilon Gourmet Coffee.  It is not any better than the regular grade of Bustelo.  Bustelo can be purchased for $2.50 to $3.00 a brick.  Their Supremem coffee is not worth one penny more.
"I have bought Duncan Hines Yellow cake mix in the past and have made a favorite recipe with it.  In the past, it had 18.25 ounces.  Pillsbury and Betty Crocker have the required ounces 18+.  I bought Duncan Hines at Safeway because it was less expensive than the other brands and after I got home, I discovered why.  I will not buy Duncan Hines again unless they go back to the 18+ ounces or go to 9 ounces for $.54.  Consumer beware and read the number of ounces in the product."
Great alternative to fettuccine if you have gluten problems. Sauce is a big helper for taste and don't boil them to long. They will clump. Overall I am very happy with them.
This is The best dog food their is because everything is very. Digestible and when the dog does digest it all digested because they use all the nutrition from it. So it is healther and the best out their far as I'm think
"This beer brewed extremely fast for me and actually foamed over the top.  I think maybe the temperature in my house was to high (80F).  Either way, it ended up tasting just fantastic.  I am highly impressed with the ease of the cooper's beer to make and how great the always taste."
"My parents are both diabetics (Type 1 and Type 2). Their blood sugar has been uncontrollable and was looking for a healthy alternative to Splenda.  Bought this last week at Whole Foods in Northbrook and it was on sale as well.<br /><br />Love the smell, but when they put it to their coffee, their blood sugar spiked 5 times the normal range.  At one point, my mom's sugar spiked to it's highest ever at 389.  She was so scared when she saw ""CHECK FOR KETONES"" on the machine.  Well, let's try baking bread and using this coconut sugar instead.  It has that same effect.  I was wondering if we could be doing something wrong.  Maybe we are using a wrong ratio to the table sugar.  My parents used the 1 to 1 ratio (e.g. 1 tsp coconut sugar = 1 tsp cane sugar).<br /><br />I really had high hopes with this product specially for my diabetic parents. I researched high and low here in Amazon and other diabetes blog sites. I have read nothing but excellent reviews of this product and other Organic Coconut Sugar.<br /><br />Please, if we are doing something wrong, let us know.  Give us some feedback.  My parents have stopped taking this and is looking for a different alternative. I read some excellent reviews regarding a product called Xylitol.  So i might try next."
I have made waffles with this mix twice and pancakes once.  The texture is perfect. Because they are whole wheat they are hearty but they are still fluffy.  They are slightly sweet and smell so yummy while your waiting for them to finish................  The next time I order the three pack I'm going to try one of their other products.
Very disapointed with this product.  They really have a terrible taste to them.  This was my first time purchasing this product  Through Amazon and I will never do it again.<br /><br />Here are the big issues with the product overall.<br /><br />Super hard<br />taste like salt pellets<br />no spice flavor<br /><br />I really could not even get through one serving.
My husband loves this in his tuna fish. I am not a tuna fish fan but with this seasoning now I eat tuna.
My dogs loves them. Glad to know that I have found a snack that is appealing to my dog but also something that won't have him breaking the scales!
"I'm not usually a drinker of flavored tea, in fact this is the only one I really drink.  I bought this Mango Ceylon tea several years ago at my local nature food store on a whim and I fell in love with it...(and so did my kids).  Since then the store told me that the flavor was discontinued, but I believe it was only discontinued by their supplier, not the manufacturer (thank goodness!).  I have bought this tea from other online retailers, but this 6 box package was the cheapest I could find this time around.  I'm glad its still available.  It's not overly fruity and the vanilla is a nice touch.<br /><br />For your regular tea drinking I urge you to try Barry's tea from Ireland, the one in the red box (Barry's Gold) I believe is the best.<br /><br />Enjoy your cuppa!"
"All 3 of my cats including the skittish/picky kitten adore these treats! My high-anxiety kitten hides all of the time and won't eat these same treats in the Milk flavor, but she always comes out and eats these Seafood treats! Couldn't be happier!"
This wheat free bread mix is great my whole family enjoys the taste and we add ground flax to it also.  We have done the pizza with the same mix and it is also good.  All good for us wheat free gluten free families.  Great product!!!
"We've been using this bread mix for about a year, as it's the best gluten-free bread mix I've found.  I usually make the sweet bread and it's very good, although it would make a great savory bread with herbs as well.  I didn't even think to try to make pizza crust with it, as we were using a mix specifically for pizza crust from another popular gluten-free brand, which I didn't really like (too light and thick like a deep dish, but without flavor).  I just tried Pamela's bread mix for pizza crust and it was amazing.  Not too thick and a bit chewy just like ""real"" pizza crust.  I did add the italian spices which are optional but suggested in the directions, and it was wonderful.  The first decent pizza we've had since we've been gluten-free!"
"As a hot chocolate lover, I was verrrrry disappointed when I tried this product. I first had the peppermint (disgusting) and then tried the dark chocolate (a little better). The problem is that you can REALLY taste the artifical sweetener. I am a diet soda drinker, so I don't have a problem with artifical sweetener. It's just that the taste was so strong in these hot chocolates that it overpowered the chocolate taste. I definitely will NOT buy again.... I would not recommend these to anyone."
I love this organic raw honey!<br /><br />When using it in my tea I don't need a lot and the taste is great.<br /><br />Honey is also helpful with moisturizing and healing so other than consuming it I also use it on my hair and face often. The darker the better.
"Wifey bought these for me for Christmas.  I used to work with a guy who would bring still warm home roasted peanuts to work.  After he left I wanted to try it myself.  These were great. 25 minutes in the oven with one stir and they are done. They taste better than any grocery store peanuts ever could.  I might shell some of them and try honey roasting too.  I see a lot of people boil them, what are boiled peanuts like?  You don't see them up here in RI and I've never tried them."
"Both dogs love these - my anything-is-delicious-Lab and my picky no-one-knows-what-he-is little mutt. The Lab gets a whole heart at a time, the lil one gets half a heart at a time. They'll follow me anywhere for these. No useless carbs means no useless calories, always a plus for my arthritic Lab. The dog food by this same company is a favorite, too. Subscribe & Save saves us lots of $$!"
"I have one of these and love it but I would never pay this much for it.  Got it a Bed, Bath, & Beyond for $24.99 and that was not a sale, just their regular price."
"... but it's gone in 60 seconds :-).  Considering the cost of the bone and how fast it disappears I will only be buying intermittently,"
This is a really great tasting substitute for cow's milk -- only 45 calories per cup.  I like it much better than unsweetened soy milk.  My local grocery store does not carry unsweetened Almond Breeze; buying from Amazon is so handy.
I have been drinking three cups of this tea for the last month and a half.  I just had my annual checkup with my doctor and my blood pressure was 108/60!!!!  After years of it being it the 140's or 135's my blood pressure is now like a young person and I am in my sixties.  I had been monitoring my blood pressure at home and it was good but usually when I see the doctor it shoots up because I am nervous but not this time.  My doctor was thrilled.  I totally believe that this tea has lowered my blood pressure and I will continue drinking it.  I steep it for 10 minutes.  I have two cups after breakfast and one cup after dinner.  It tastes good and I don't put any sweetener in it.  I highly recommend it as it did work for me.
This mix is just not that good.  Very runny and the taste is horrible.  I do not recommened this.
This granola provides just the right mix of sweetness and flavor. And it packs 9 grams of fiber per serving making this a snack that will keep you full. I would highly recommend this granola to anyone looking for a Gluten Free snack. We love adding it as a topping to yogurt.
"I recently bought a Keurig Coffee maker because my husband and I love our coffee and tea, but sometimes want different drinks on certain days and this coffee maker fit the bill. We both enjoy this hot cocoa as much as do our grandchildren. Likely the best hot cocoa K-cup that we have tried so far. They arrived sooner than expected and arrived as described. Happy with the service and the product.<br />Comment Comment  Permalink"
"The site doesn't list the ingredients for their products online.  Had I known the product was full of trans fats I would not have ordered it.  Watch your labels.  Partially hydrated = partially hydrogenated.  You have to laugh at the ways manufacturers will try to fool the public.  In the future I will not order a product that doesn't list its ingredients online so that consumers can make informed purchases.<br /><br />Did try the product and found it tasteless.  No heat/spice and it left a waxy film on the roof of the mouth, must be from the wax.  I was going to send it to my son in college but tossed it in the trash instead.  The sad thing is that they do NOT have to use trans fats to get flavor.  They just don't care."
"Was a good product in theory but the oatmeal was flavorless, the fruits were ok, and it contained hard chunks that would not soften even after reheating it for an extra 1 minute.<br /><br />Seriously not worth buying but i do recommend the black bean soup. It kicks ass."
"I have a friend brought me a pack from Jordan. It is a wonderful coffee, rich taste of Arabia, with ground cardamon. you've got to try it. it is very easy to prepare, just read the instruction written on the pack. I was searching Amazon to see if they have it and I am planning to get another one in future (isA)."
"Needed something to add to my protein shakes (vanilla) besides strawberries.  I have heard about this product but was hesitant on if it actually ""tastes"" like peanut butter.......UNBELIEVABLE taste!! Tastes EXACTLY like peanut butter!  Buy it.  You won't regret it."
"I first bought the small, 100-calorie pack box in my local store.  They are a wonderful source of protein without the carbs, salt, and extra sugar that come with other snacks or with roasted nuts (e.g., especially honey-roasted nuts).<br /><br />These whole, raw almonds are great for anyone with a blood sugar issue.  The raw almonds won't make your blood sugar spike; are handy if your blood sugar has dropped and you need a quick source of food; and, the 1.5-ounce bags are sturdy and won't rip--or haven't yet in my overly packed and oft-mangled bag.<br /><br />As the previous reviewer mentioned, once you start eating these, you won't miss the added fat and salt of any distributor's ""roasted"" nuts.  Since eating these natural almonds, I haven't missed the traditional ""roasted"" nut taste.  I grew up on the usual nuts, but now I find I really look forward to this new, clean taste.  For all these reasons, I recommend Blue Diamond's raw almonds.<br /><br />(However, if you still think that these almonds aren't crunchy enough for you--especially if you bought the canned nuts--you could always roast them yourself.  Put the raw almonds on a cookie sheet [you may want to line your sheet with foil or parchment paper] in a pre-heated oven at 350 degree F.  Stir them a few times to ensure they don't scorch (I would check around 6 minutes--especially if your oven is a bit temperamental [like mine]; and stir and check again before 10 minutes [because it's amazing how fast nuts can go from 'almost done' to 'scorched'--or worse--'burnt'].  Roasting them yourself still has to be much healthier than any nuts that are cooked in oil.  Remember also, if you do roast the raw almonds in the oven, please cool them completely and then refrigerate them afterward.)"
"Used to eat the Spicy Thai flavor all the time.  MSG makes my body unhappy and this was one of the few flavored chips that was MSG free.  Now they have changed the whole recipe and how they make them.  Instead of being real food on the ingredients like it used to be its mostly processed chemical garbage, a bunch more salt and MSG stuffed in under the label ""yeast extract"".  They removed the NO MSG from the label so they know very well what they did.<br /><br />The worst part though is that they taste horrible.  Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.<br /><br />What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.  It seems they are slowly moving one flavor at a time to this new cheap ingredient list and manufacturing method.  Dont be fooled into paying a premium price for these chips as they are not a premium product anymore."
"I've got two dogs who will eat almost anything. I like to give them good, wholesome food and the increasing prices make it difficult. I purchased the Merrick Turducken as Merrick used to be a great company that made wonderful dog food that looked like human food. Not in this case! It looks, smells, and has the same appetizing effect on my dogs as if I'd thrown up in the bowl. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!! Neither of my dogs likes it and I'm stuck with an expensive case of food. My dogs both sniffed their bowls, then walked away. I'm feeding it to them as its bought and paid for, but I feel cruel doing so. They usually won't jump right into eating it, no matter how hungry they are. They do eat a little, but usually leave at least half in their bowl and that's so unlike them! Horrible dog food. Would never recommend to anyone. Looks disgusting and must taste the same the way my dogs are avoiding it."
"I give these treats to my dog, and he can't get enough of them.  This is his favorite treat by far, and since it's made of chicken breasts, I feel like it's pretty healthy."
"This soup is advertised as ""creamy,"" however when it arrived it was ""signature.""  Puck changed the recipe of the Creamy Butternut Squash Soup and is now calling it Signature Butternut Squash Soup.  It does not taste the same (and is not as good) as the original recipe."
My little pitt bull mix loves this food.  It is a nice size for crunching and also fits well into the treat ball for play.  I give it to my cats for a treat and they love it too.
Nothing wrong with this product as far as the dogs are concerned.  They always want more than just one a day but we try to limit them to that amount for their own good and our pocket book.
"If you like mint chocolate, or York Peppermint Patties for that matter, then there's no reason you won't like the taste of these.  They're just like eating M&Ms but with minty freshness added to them.  4 stars because I think these candies are overpriced for what they are."
"I love uncle ray's potatoe chips. They have alot of spice on each chip.  They taste spicy with a tang of sweet. When I order a box, I pass them out to friends who love them. My husband, my kids and I eat a whole bag at a time.  I limit myself to ordering only twice ayear. The salt content makes me blow up, but I still love them."
"I love it when it worked for the first 6 months.  Woke up one morning, dead!  Never to be used again, too much to spend for 6 months of use.  Useless, do not recommend."
"I eat dried mango almost everyday and have tried so many different brands, but this brand is the worst. I almost thought it was spoiled, but every 1 of the 6 packs tasted the same. Mushy and overly sweet. I had to check the package to make sure sugar wasn't added. I would definitely try a different brand!"
"I ordered a whole box of 6 cans of the cereal. When I opened the first  one,  only a little more than half of the can is filled with the cereal. Well, I thought I got a lemon. I opened another can, surprise, the similar half full amount. It turned out all 6 cans were just like that. Why would they use such a big can when they only fill half of it?  Although I like the ingredient, I will never buy the brand again. It's not the way to do a honest business. So I am not going to trust its listed nutrition."
Saw these on Oprah and ordered them for Christmas gifts.  The packages are really ugly and cheap looking which didn't help when giving as gifts.  Saved 2 packages for our family Christmas Eve treats. I can't say they are horrible but it tasted like any old chocolate shake.  It has a very strong chocolate taste so I added more milk to tame the taste.  These are pretty exprensive so we expected better.
"My ""Sammy"" is very picky on treats but he loves these and the best thing is he is 7 and a half years old and has never had to have his teeth cleaned. The Vet says his teeth are clear of tartar so I've saved enough in Vet bills to more than pay for his special chews"
"Hey, the description says 360 grams - that is roughly 13 ounces at under $4.00 per can. No way - that is the approximate price for a 100 gram can."
"If you are like me peanut butter is your crack! However, at 200 calories a serving it is a large dietary investment. But with PB2 all worries are put to rest. With only 45 calories per equivalent serving you can't get better than that. I love this product. It tastes and has the same consistency as normal peanut butter when mixed with water. Take my review along with all the other reviews and TRY IT."
"Vendor shipped promptly and the product arrived in excellent condition. This is an extremely well made product containing no grain fillers. I had to purchase the entire case, not knowing if my feline diners would even like it. It would have been nice if the vendor would allow sample purchases of select varieties rather than an entire case."
This is a wonderful item! I add fruit and flaxseed when making the shake. Tastes great! I needed something that did not have the Soy in it. Soy is everywhere! Yuck. I love Hemp shakes now.<br />Very worth ordering. I will try the Berry when it becomes available.<br />Awesome!
"Light, crispy, super-tasty. Only disappointed that my grocer doesn't carry more of the flavors. I guess I will have to buy the variety pack on Amazon."
"I don't want anyone to think this is an unfair review of the product, it's more of a warning from my own personal experience so others don't make a mistake.<br /><br />When I got my new kitten from the humane society they sent him home with a goodie bag that happened to include these treats. I started feeding them to him and he seemed to like it. Then I noticed he would vomit occasionally. It was only after closer inspection did I realize these treats are for cats 6 MONTHS AND OLDER. I'm sure there's a reason for this, they caused his vomiting. I switched to a different temptations medley and he hasn't vomited since. So keep in mind, there IS a reason they limit these to older cats, they really aren't kitten safe. I only wish my humane society realized this before sending them home with him. I can only imagine they feed these to all the cats in their care without reading the package."
"The aroma is pleasant, and flavor is nice and smooth, but it is very, very weak.  I really wanted to like this one as there are very few available on subscribe and save, but I just cannot recommend it.  Even making smaller cups it is very weak.  I'm going to stick to Newman's Own Organics Extra Bold as my go to k-cup for now."
"I read the reviews for this product and had high hopes for a healthy, decent tasting cup of noodles. Needless to say I found this not to be true. First, the consistency is gross and second, the taste is awful. Maybe I am just not accustomed to eating crap. Think twice before ordering this product. I wish I did."
"Excellent, mixes well in a protein shake and tastes just like a jar of peanut butter!<br />The only problem with ordering it from Amazon is they have an obvious pricing mistake, I can get this from other websites for $3.99 a jar, even if your an amazon prime member and get free shipping here, you will still save a lot ordering it elsewhere.<br />You can even get it from the manufactures website for much cheaper.<br />I called the company and the suggested retail price is approx. $4.00 per jar."
my finicky cats wouldn't eat this food so I gave it to my neighbor who rescues cats so the food wouldn't go to waste...
I've had these before and loved them!  This time I only like them!  Don't know why this is - maybe manufacturer changed recipe.  If so I wish they would go back to the original recipe as I liked them a lot more!
"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:29 Mins<br /><br /></span>My dog received this as a gift a few years back. It is THE BEST toy ever and keeps her busy for a long time! She has mastered it so well, and enjoys it so much, that she will bring the empty jug to me when she wants it filled up! LOL!"
"This is an great product. The taste is great, and it works exactly as described. Superb natural sleep aid. AMAZING!"
"If you want a rich, smooth tasting, strong, but not bitter cup of coffee, I highly recommend this product.  It is not as dark as I normally buy, but it stands up quite well using my espresso machine (an inexpensive non-pump).  I was surprised at the crema it produced.  In short, it's everything I look for in a delicious cup of coffee."
"I love Stephens Chocolate Raspberry. It is the best I've ever had. Other brands I've tried were bitter and just not as tasty.<br />It stirs in smooth, no lumps.<br />My order arrived quickly, just as promised. I'm a very happy consumer of this product and the supplier."
"I have drank Bigelow band peppermint tea and loved it.  But, by current supermarket doesn't carry Bigelow's peppermint tea and I figured how different can they be..after all the ingredients on both is ""Peppermint"".  I was very surprised to find Celestial Seasonings peppermint tea is very weak tasting.  I am using two tea bags just to get more flavor.  Also, there is a subtle difference in the taste of the two teas.  Bigelow's brand has a slightly sweeter taste, which I enjoy.  In the future I will not be purchasing Celestial Seasonings peppermint tea."
"I switched to mate from coffee a few years ago. I know it's generally an afternoon drink, but I drink it in the morning like coffee. There were a couple of websites where I bought it regularly. Unfortunately, Dr. Oz saw fit to publicly endorse it as a health tea, and the price went up everywhere, including my regular sellers. So I went looking, and found this on amazon.<br /><br />This is my favorite brand. The Selecci&oacute;n Especial is aged two years in special wooden boxes with vents to let smoke in. This is ""elaborada con palo"", meaning that it has stem bits in it, which makes the flavor last longer for more refills. Some will prefer ""sin palo""(without stems), because the stems also add a little bitterness to the mate.<br /><br />I understand that in Argentina, where mate is a common as coffee is here, Rosamonte is generally regarded as one of the best commercially available mate brands.<br /><br />Of this seller in particular, I can say that they were prompt, and that the box came with a couple free samples of flavored mate. A lot of people will prefer the flavored kinds, especially either ""citron"" which is lemon, or ""hierbes de monta&ntilde;a"", which means moutain herbs and tastes like mint.<br /><br />I, however, prefer this for day-to-day consumption. I run plain water through the coffee-maker, fill a large coffee cup about 1/3 full with mate, and just keep topping it up with hot water for a couple hours as I sip it through the bombilla.<br /><br />The main thing that pleased me about this merchant is that the product was considerably less dusty than what I had been getting from my previous suppliers. The difference is probably about handling and storage. The bags are like a bag of sugar, and a lot of rough handling could crush the leaves inside, creating dust. In the mate, dust gets through the holes in the bombilla and coats your tongue, tastes a little bitter, and generally degrades the experience.<br /><br />When it first arrived, I opened a bag and poured it into a big tupperware container that I use to store it. And I immediately noticed that there was very little dust compared to what I had been getting when I ordered this from my old seller.<br /><br />I'm very happy with what I received."
I was surprised to find out how weak this coffee is.  It has a good flavor but even on half cup it is very weak.
"I'm not sure what the flavor people over at Healthy Choice are up to, but this one sure doesn't taste like teriyaki.  Really, it doesn't taste like anything at all.  Bland, bland, bland.  When you're dealing with rice as the main base of the dish, it helps to have some bold flavor to add some zing--not happening here.  The water chestnuts seem out of place and even though they provide some crunch (which I wasn't expecting, and isn't listed on the package), they add no flavor--actually it seems as though they're just bitter.<br /><br />I couldn't recommend this dish any less.  I will not be buying this one again!"
"Great low carb snack, was bummed when the South Beach bars were pulled and happy to find at least my favorite variety still made under a different name."
"We started our son on baby food a little after his 6 month birthday.  (he is almost 8 months now)  After introducing avocado and quinoa cereal, we tried NuturMe's squash, and it was a huge hit.  Same with the sweet potatoes, then the peas, then the apples.  I love that they are organic, they really do taste fresh and I much prefer to make it for him than give him jarred food.  I will often use a different spoon to mix it so I can lick some of it off, it tastes so good!  (the peas might be my favorite!)  Another reviewer was right, the peas end up being a bit grainy in texture; at first we just mixed it with a bit more water to make it smoother/more soupy, but now he eats it just fine at the 3 tbsp. of water mixture.  I just ordered some more as our stash was running out - a very sad thing!  I also want to try the ""froggy pasta"" recipe I saw on their blog.  I keep thinking of ways I want to use NurturMe after he's out of the puree stage.  I can't wait for them to introduce new flavors!"
I was so excited to receive the product I immediately cooked a bag.  What a disappointment!!  The taste of the pork skins was there but it was buried by some spice that I didn't enjoy.. I couldn't finish the bag!  My dog wouldn't eat them either ans she eats everything - including brusell sprouts!  I have had microwave pork skins that were good but I don't remember the brand so I'll just have to do without
"We were very excited to order the Blueberry Pancake mixes since we've loved many other Stonewall products. Unfortunately, we didn't like the pancake mix at all. We actually ended up throwing the pancakes away. The batter itself tasted terrible. It had this strong, almost sour taste and almost seemed carbonated/fizzy? We thought it would be better after we cooked it, but it wasn't. Also the blueberries were like hard little rocks.<br /><br />Too bad we bought the 3-pack, because now we have a lot of this product and won't be able to use it."
"When in Jamaica I drink JBM coffee and have come to develope a fine appreciation for the bean. What I opened this morning was not what I had expected. To be clear, I was greatly dissapointed. I found bits of husk from the bean, which doesn't make coffee, and is considered filler. The flavor left something to be desired as well, it tasted like folgers coffee without all the acid. I was hoping to leave a great review of this product, but honesty forbids it."
I ordered the spotted dick. After eating I felt a little strange. I went to the bathroom and to my horror realized that I had this horrible disease. Luckily 1 gallon 128 Floz Tuscan Whole Milk cleared this up for me.
"I was expecting this to be a weak-bodied coffee, but I was pleasantly surprised! I used this in my Keurig with a reusable K-cup and it's probably one of the stronger blends I have gotten with the reusable cup.  I tried it without cream or sugar first (I'm normally a 2-and-2 kinda' girl) and even without anything in it, I can drink it.  It's full-flavored without the burn and dread of serious heartburn half-way through the cup. With cream and sugar, the flavor was even better and super smooth going down. If you're looking for a morning pick-me-up without the afternoon heartburn, this is a great full-flavored choice!"
"I was a skeptic about this product until I tried it with skim milk. This cereal is delicious and retains its crunch even after 5 minutes of being soaked in milk. I enjoy its texture and caramelly flavor. I think it could definitely be less sweet and lower carb, but so far, I find this cereal to have the highest fiber content. The other vitamins and minerals a single serving contains is also comparable to similar products by other companies. This is perfect for breakfast or a snack any time of the day!"
"These are definitely not worth close to a dollar a piece.  If they were at my local grocery, I might give twenty to thirty cents per can for them.  I didn't really like the flavor that well, but if you did, they might even worth up to fifty cents per can.  Otherwise, pass these up."
"This muffin mix is awful,..all you taste is flour and sour cream,.which is used to make these.  It just tastes wierd. I've tried and tried,..<br />there are no good tasting low carb ""treats"",..esp. for diabetics."
I am very impressed with these country ham slices. A very high quality prooduct greatly exceeds standard racecar driver ham slices from the supermarket. Great flavor not too salty or too sweet.
"Gluten free products can be hit or miss.  I'm fairly new to living the gluten free lifestyle, and I've often been surprised by how bad some gluten free products can be.  I've had good luck with Pamela's products so far.  I noticed several people didn't like Pamela's Coconut Whenever bars, but I loved them!<br /><br />I think the size is just right for a snack, and they are moist and chewy.  The coconut flavor seemed authentic to me, not artificial.  There was just the right amount of chocolate to round out the flavor.  The chewy texture was just right as well, although every now and then I hit a piece of a hull or something that was unexpected.<br /><br />I've pretty much given up on most baked goods since giving up gluten.  I have no idea if I would like these bars as much if I were still able to eat 'regular' food.  Overall, I think they are very good for a gluten free product and it's something I'd like to have again."
"My cat looked at it, smelled it for a minute or so, took one bite and ran away.  She would not touch it after that.  We donated the rest of the shipment to a shelter.  Hopefully some cats there will like it.  The only thing I can get my cat to eat is Fancy Feast.  I have tried all the organic and grain free brands and she won't touch any of them.  She is an indoor/outdoor cat that we adoted as a one year old who was stray.  I think the only meat she likes besides fancy feast is fresh kill.  If you know some healthy brands that your fussy cat has enjoyed, please write a review or email me if that is an option."
It works and lasts for a few minutes to make sours sweet.  Its trippy.
"I ordered Ka-me rice crunch crackers, plain. I received Ka-me gluten-free rice crackers, original, all natural.  Unfortunately, they have soy products in this cracker and therefore I can't eat it.  This looks different from the picture that came with the crackers I ordered.  Apparently I can't return the box of crackers."
"My friend who lives in Fla. told me about these French twists and was complaining that she couldn't find them here in Middletown, OH.  I ordered 12 boxes to see what she was raving about and found only one problem with them.......I couldn't stop eating them.  I ate 11 boxes of them in just a few days and gave the last one away so I wouldn't eat it too.  If a person can stop after eating 1 or 2 servings, they are a great addition to your diet.  Unfortunately, I couldn't stop!!!!!"
"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:32 Mins<br /><br /></span>We threw an office party with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00331Y536"">25 Pre Packs of Dippin' Dots Ice Cream</a> and it was such a hit we wanted to share what was in the box!"

Excellent product, excellent price and service from Amazon!"
"I love this gravy mix - much easier and less fat than making from scratch and not as salty as McCormick's or other brands.<br /><br />I use non-fat milk instead of water to make a cream gravy.  This is good stuff.  And by time you order this set of 24 and other items, there is no shipping and no tax.  The price is much less than I could get when on sale at my local supermarket."
"Great idea, but my fido is so frustrated he lays there and crying and barking hoping the treats will fall out.  Still working on training him, but not sure this is good for his psyche.  He'd much rather unscrew the bottom if he could."
"I had to look for a new food for my 100 pound puppy.<br />She has a sensitive stomach and sheds extensively when in that phase. And as many of you know,  it is hard to find good food.<br />I have ordered 3 small bags of different food/brands, this one was the first on the list to try.<br /><br />After 2 days, the coat of my dog got better and softer too. I would have not thought that it would work so fast.<br />Poop stayed solid (I didn't have a problem with that on the previous food, but its important) and it doesn't have a nasty smell anymore, as with the previous food. Great again!<br />She still sheds a little but the coat is getting much much nicer and I am confident that it is a matter of a few more days until it is in outstanding condition.<br /><br />***After 4 days, the shine of my dogs skin is definitely noticeable. This food is high quality and it shows on your dog. We also got rid of the nasty gas which is as well a great indicator of a good food. I recommend this food over Acana, Orijen or other foods with high protein levels, as it is grain free!!! (very important).<br /><br />As for the price, Amazon is a fabulous website (& I do have Prime), however I was able to get 2 bags for $39.94/bag WITH shipping included on another website! And as I am typing this, I got additional on time 10% off .. so not even with Prime I would be able to get to that price.<br /><br />Anyway, as far as the food goes, it is very very good. Just be careful with the high protein levels, not all dogs might do well with it. Get a small bag and see how it works and of course mix it in with current food. If it doesn't work (lot of gas and loose stool after a week or more), try a different brand with less protein. You might want to look at Precise Holistic, Fromm Gold or Canidea alternatives. Very good foods but the protein is lower. Get small bags, try one, mix in little by little, if it doesn't work, go back to the previous food and than start with the other bag.<br /><br />In case of questions I will be happy to help.<br /><br />***UPDATE: So after about two weeks of use, the coat is shinier as EVER, its absolutely beautiful. The last time I remember her coat being so shiny was when she was a puppy. There is a little gas now and than, but nothing horrible (and I do feed my dog at night, so her stomach works during the night), stool is solid and still no smell. I also notice my dog shaking her head less because of ears, food CAN cause ear and eye infection, so that is satisfying too. As for the shedding, it has almost stopped. Its 80% better!!!<br /><br />This is definitely the best food we have tried in 18 months. We have tried around 10-12 different brands. That gives you an idea of how good it is. Also, it is ridiculously cheap, if you know, where to buy it. This food, under $40! is without a doubt, the best food money can buy. Well, at least for us it is."
"My pets came running when they heard the call of ""treats!"". Of course when a new treat is offered the devour it, the real test is...will they eat all the treats in the bag over the next few days or will they turn their nose up at the treat the second or third time it is given.<br />They LOVED the whole bag! Even the cats had to get in and get some(of course theirs had to be crumbled for them, as the biscuits are medium to big dog size)and the loved the treats too.<br />I did not feel guilty about giving any of the animals the treats as they are 100% organic and even better I could pronounce what every ingredient was (as well as know what it was (carrots, lamb, molasses etc)!"
Gross! I tried these thinking they would at least taste like the regular powdered mixes.  The flavor is all fake sweetener (odd since sucralose is the last ingredient) and no dark chocolate.  I am bummed because now I have a box of these cups and don't want to drink them.
"This particular brand and blend of Green Mountain coffee is one of the best I have ever tasted or enjoyed.  Its got a nice body, is NOT bitter, and goes down very smoothly.  Would recommend to any coffee drinkers for their morning fix to get moving."
These are soooo good but make sure you shake the bag and evenly spread the pieces out within the bag and micro for about 70-90 seconds depending on  your microwave. Always keep an eye on the bag once it blows up to its full area DON'T let it go for any longer than 20 seconds or they will burn and with the hot and spicy your kitchen and your eyes will feel like you have been pepper sprayed. Little more difficult to cook but its worth it. Enjoy
The giant tootsie rolls taste much better than the little midgets.  The size of these big ones is perfect.  The size of this container is perfect and wil last quite some time.
I did not know that Pace Mexican Four Cheese was discontinued until just now when I googled... my husband just went to 4 different grocery stores looking for it since that is one of the ingredients of one of my very best personal recipes!!  I am very disappointed that once again a company discontinued something that was JUST FINE!!! Now I have to write Pace next. :((
"Although some may like this drink, it will not be a repeat buy for me.  140 calories for an 8+ oz serving is too much when that amount of orange juice is 115.  Actually this drink isn't 100% orange/tangerine juice, but a mix of juices.  Secondly, if this were unaltered juice, seems you wouldn't have to add ascorbic acid to get 100% of your daily Vitamin C since that amount of orange juice naturally provides over 150%. Perhaps the processing requires it. But, alas, the biggest issue for me was taste.  It tasted to me like dishwashing liquid smells.<br /><br />On the good side, the carbonization is just right and the flavor is bold for those who seek that.  There is no sugar added and the non-traditional taste is not overly sweet.  The taste may appeal to some, but I'm not a fan."
"But if you have high blood pressure, skip it!!  Even small amounts of black licorice root can raise your blood pressure to unhealthy levels.  The licorice in the tea is only there to add sweetness."
"Wonderful tasty coffee with a nice aroma as it is brewing. There is no after-taste at all and it very satisfying, you always want another cup of coffee. I continue to buy it."
"I don't usually bother with reviews, but these results pretty much demanded it. Our 9-year-old shepherd mix is literally a different dog since starting to take these treats. For the past couple of years he's been acting quite old - slow, not much energy, and often would have arthritic-type pain in this shoulders & hips. He would play for a couple of minutes and then lay down, totally uninterested in continuing. You could just see in his eyes that he was tired and old. A variety of supplements hadn't done much, and we felt awful that all we could do was give him aspirin for the pain. We switched his food to one with higher glucosamine, but it didn't make much of an identifiable difference. Last month, after he'd been significantly worse with shoulder & hip pains for a few weeks, I went online to research arthritis supplements and orthopedic pet beds (the last step before deciding to put him on medication). After reading reviews on these Zukes Hip Action treats, I decided to give them a shot and bought two bags on Amazon. OH MY GOODNESS!! It's been about two or three weeks now, and I am BLOWN AWAY. He's acting like a 5-year-old! He has more energy, he's jumping again, and his eyes look so much happier! That's the best part, to see him happy & excited again. Previously, it had been years since he would run with me any longer than about twenty minutes, and by the end of the run I would be dragging him behind me... this week I took him for a run and he went with me for an HOUR! And he was still ahead of me when we finished!! We're so hopeful that he'll be able to enjoy his ""golden years"" without the misery of a poorly aging dog. I'm completely a believer in this product, and we'll be giving them to every dog we ever own. (Plus, you just saved me a bundle on an expensive pet bed.) ;D"
"I love the texture and flavor of this product.  It is not very strong and will easily break, if you put a lot of food on it."
"All the 5-star reviews convinced me to buy these...I wish I hadn't :(  It's been two months since I purchased them and I still have four out of the six containers unopened.  They're just blah.  Now the chili lime flavored almonds from Blue Diamond, on the other hand, are Mmm Mmm good!"
"I was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix.  I usually like most of the Low Carb things I have tried, but was diappointed in this specific one."
"For a change of pace that's  good for you, try this cinnamon tea by Bigelow. It also makes an amazaing iced tea, just add your favorite fresh citrus fruit!"
Best gluten-free bread by far. We make ours in the bread machine and little over 2 hours and delicious fresh bread. Buying in bulk is smart if you eat alot of bread.
"Unfortunately, I somehow stumbled upon this product and, based on all the glowing reviews, bought a case.  Upon opening the first bag and eating a couple, I was disgusted by the taste.  Worst thing I've ever ordered from Amazon---and I've ordered a lot.  I don't think the nutritional values are all that great, either."
"When I bought this mat I initially thought it was fine but it actuality is too small and at the beginning my cats didn't like stepping on it either.  Because of it' small size, I end up with daily litter on either side of this mat.  Disappointed and now looking for a replacement that catches more of the litter."
"The flavor is not that great.  I would prefer something with a little more flavor,tastes like cheap coffee.  I would not this purchase again."
"WOW, this is a cool dog toy. Have a year and half old Rat Terrier that absolutely loves this thing. I did have to fill it up full(I use cat food) at beginning so she would get rewarded aften but now there is no problem. She drags it around the house and plays with it until its empty."
"High quality body wash that is very thick and lathers quickly and easily. It has a very pleasant, flowery smell that lasts for hours after you get out of the shower. You only have to use a small amount about the size of a quarter to last your entire shower. So even though the product is expensive, you will get a lot of use out of it. It seems that the cheaper, dollar a bottle kind I sometimes use only lasts a week or 2 because I have to use more of the product to last throughout a shower.<br /><br />I would say the smell lasts for around 6 hours or so so it's almost like perfume. My sister-in-law asked me yesterday, ""You always smell so good. What do you wear?"" I wasn't wearing any perfume of any kind at the time because it was very early in the morning before I had done my morning routine and I had to run something over there to her. I told her that it must just be the body wash. If you have ever used Dove shampoo or conditioners, it is almost the same smell.<br /><br />I am looking forward to trying the cucumber/green tea kind when I run out of these 4 bottles. I would totally recommend this for yourself or for any woman in your life: aunt, mother, girlfriend, wife. I know many women who would never buy this Dove product because they always choose their children and families over themselves, ie buying themselves whatever is cheapest. I intend on buying some of this for my mom and aunt to maybe put in a gift basket or care package for them.<br /><br />I also use this as bubble bath when I take a nice hot bath. Excellent product. A+ from me."
I got these at my local Publix. They're the best tasting almonds of the bunch. The butter toffee tastes natural and the almonds are of good quality. They also make dark chocolate covered almonds. They taste like Cocoa Puffs but are still pretty good if you're looking for a cocoa kick instead.
"My dogs loved this when they first got them.  Now, my 11 yr old, Bonkers,is the only one of the 3 who has figured it out.  Tons of fun and none of the 3 has broken one yet!!!"
"Tricky Marketing<br />(Look up ""True (sic) Blue"" dig deep into their site or study the vague label.)<br /><br />""100% Cranberry Juice"" is false labeling; ""100% Juice Cranberry"" passes...; has other juices for sweetening (apple, grape, pear) and for attractiveness: anything goes.<br />Just no sugar or high fructose corn syrup. Hence 100% juice.<br />With sugar is called ""natural sweetening."" ""Blend"" might not be 100% juices. Juice ""Cocktail"" is invariably with high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />I found real Ocean Spray 100% Cranberry Juice in quarts at a ""Grocery Outlet"" market once a few years ago. Undrinkably tart, but perfect for making my own less-than-sweet blends and thirst-aides using fresh berries and fruits with water, and for extending store-shelf juices too sweet for me. 100% C.J. is not a consumer product, but for food & beverage product makers.<br /><br />Cranberry Juice Concentrate is also very handy & 100% CJ."
"All greenies are overpriced.  But, since my critters love 'em so, I watch the price and get a bunch when it drops to a more reasonable level.  Still too high, but.....<br /><br />Since I'm buying something, I think is way overpriced...  yet I still buy it, should say it all.  My gang loves the darn things.  I prefer tendons or pizzles, since they last awhile.  But, they love Greenies.  So, I get em.<br /><br />You probably will too...  we got our pets, right where THEY want us......"
Delicious and the best price I could find! No more buying the syrup at stores for half the size and the same price.
". . . like me, you can still enjoy the delicate beauty of bonsai. Carefully preserved, these are real bonsai preserved in suspended animation. They need no feeding, pruning, watering or plant care, merely cosmetic care. For those of us who don't have the time, patience or skill to cultivate plants, these make a nice surrogate, and they make nice gifts, too. Preserved bonsai can reach into the hundreds of dollars. This one is double-trunked, reasonably priced, and very attractive."
"Our beloved Bengal kitty, Isabel, is 13 years old and suffering from kidney stones, which are inoperable in felines. For years she lived on dry food but began to shun it as her health declined. Our vet ultimately advised feeding her whatever she'd eat: ""She might as well be as happy as possible in her declining years.""<br /><br />So, we offered her one soft food after another. She turned up her nose at the expensive, vet-sold brands and repeatedly rejected one national brand and flavor after another. Finally, to her gustatory delight (and our great relief), she made her choice: this particular Wiskas version is the ONLY kind she'll eat day in and day out. It MUST be Whiskas with the turkey AND GIBLETS in GRAVY. The gravy seems to add a certain flavor and texture she can't resist.<br /><br />We surmise that, like humans, our pets have food preferences linked to palate-pleasing aroma and taste. This Whiskas is the one that rings the bell for our Izzy. No, it's not the best choice for managing kidney stones, but she's got to eat. (So you won't worry that we're ignoring her renal problems, she's on daily medication and is doing quite well.)<br /><br />It's not an inexpensive cat food, but its packaging is very convenient and space-saving. The Amazon auto-ship program is a life saver. The cartons always arrive on time, and the per-package bulk rate is lower than the price of small quanities. Also, our local Target was the only place we could find this exact variety, and now the store no longer carries it. (Remember, our cat demands GIBLETS and GRAVY and accepts no substitutes).<br /><br />Give autoship a try. The price is better, and you can easily adjust the quantity and frequency of shipment or cancel altogether."
"The coffee is good but the price is ridiculous($1.25 each K-cup approx).  You can get it from Green Mountain for 75 cents a K-cup (delivered) which is still too much. Buy it for 60 cents a K-cup at Bed, Bath and Beyond or Kohls."
"I purchase almost daily from Amazon and recommend Amazon to my friends constantly. I think that makes me a very good customer.<br />I have a very serious concern. When Amazon sells pet food and/or treats made in China they must be disclosed on the Amazon page as ""MADE IN CHINA"". No one who loves their pet will buy them, but Amazon will at least give us a fair chance to protect our beloved pets from these poisons imported from China.<br />As a loyal customer, I expect Amazon to protect me and my loved ones from hidden threats. Amazon MUST disclose the country of origin for ALL food products! If Amazon is too ashamed to disclose the source, then Amazon should not sell it!"
"This is one of the best mint chocolate syrup I've ever had so far.  The others pale in flavor by comparison.  There are only seven ingredients in this sauce, including organic natural mint flavor.  In the past I used ice cream heavy with other flavors like butterscotch, chocolate chips, Oreo cookies, caramel et al, because the mint flavor of other mint chocolate sauces was too pale.  Now I buy plain vanilla or chocolate ice cream and the minty flavor of the Santa Cruz Organic Mint Chocolate syrup really stands out but doesn't overpower the flavor of the ice cream. There are only 110 calories.  And because the mint flavor is very apparent to my taste, I use it sparingly, so this 15.5 oz container last a bit longer than the other syrups I used."
"as i expected its a great taste and healthy and good shipment packing great fair value, i will order it again ,thank u starbux"
"I was ready to buy one of the carousel type k-cup storage devices when I saw this one.<br />It is a bit exepnsive, but it preserves counter space and keeps the k-cups right there.<br />I also use it to store the EZ cup reusable system."
"My dog loves this treat.  She gets two a day.  I dog sit and gave some to a lab I was watching and he loves it also so I gave a bag to the owners and they say when he get it he takes it to his ""special spot"" to enjoy it.  There's only one other treat that he'll do that with.  Excellent treat!"
"I really like lemonade, but without the sugar, and this fits the bill when I don't have fresh lemons.  For a large glass I use 4 packets, add stevia instead of sugar, plus ice and, voila, a refreshing summer drink.  It does contain soy, however, whereas the True Lime does not.  Why it needs to have soy in it is anyone's guess.  The True Lemon store sells the product cheaper than Amazon."
All rice cereal contains arsenic which may cause cancer.  Check with your pedeatrician and see if you can switch to oatmeal instead which this brand carries as well. You can google rice cereal and arsenic for more information.  I will not be feeding my baby any rice after reading about arsenic.
"I love this, i sometimes go to indian store but i dont find it at times, i wish safeway etc all keep it. These are the best biscuits but unfortunately very very bad packing. these are pretty brittle and it breaks easily, this time i got with about 5 of the packs almost fully crushed, 3 were total powdered. I would never take it again from amazon, i get it way cheaper in indian groceries, just that stock there keeps getting over and i have to find the right time to get it . but it is better than eating powder.  So somehow review is complicated, since the product is good and amazon has nothing to do with it, the only thing amazon has to do is handling and shipping, which is very badly done. So unfortunately my bad rating will affect the product, but please remember this is a good product, i am giving bad rating for amazon handling and shipping ONLY."
"I love using this to sweeten tea, coffee, etc. It tastes much better than other low glycemic sweeteners - there is no bitter aftertaste."
This candy when I opened the chocolate had white spots and looked like thick chalk. I later noticed that the box had a snow flake pattern like it was sold around xmas time. No good!
This seasoning packet is excellent with any meat or poultry.  I used it several times while grilling and cooking in the oven.  Great flavor and I got nothing but praise.  I highly recommend everyone try it.  You won't be disappointed.
"This is a good organic hollandaise sauce if you haven't had a non-organic store bought or homeade version in a while.  It has a much more noticeable lemon taste than non-organic store bought versions we've tried.  We had purchased a non-organic store bought version and decided to purchase a case on Amazon, this was the only brand and I remember buying it at Whole Foods.  That's the only reason I noticed the difference in taste."
"I recently ordered the 16 oz., 3 Pack.  When my FedEx order arrived on December 26, 2008 there were only two 16 oz. bags contained in my order.  I would like my missing 16 oz. bag to be sent to me or at least be refunded 1/3 of my $105 charged price."
"Have tried a half dozen K cup flavors, and have found this to be the most substantial. Many of the others are very weak brews."
"I first discovered these while searching through some Hungry Girl recipes. I simply dump the bag into a colander and rinse well, removing all of the water that the noodles were packed in. Then I blot them dry and throw them on a microwaveable plate and microwave for 1 minute. I again blot all the excess water and microwave for one more minute. That way the noodles are cooked, the ""weird odor"" is completely gone, and the noodles are similar to al dente. I just dump whatever my sauce/concoction I made for the noodles over it and toss! If it seems time consuming with the microwave- think about waiting 12-14 minutes for pasta to boil- not to mention time for the water to come to a boil ;).<br /><br />I would buy these noodles in a HEARTBEAT on here, but that's just highway robbery to pay 10$ in shipping!! I'm going to give Miracle Noodles a try because I can't afford to pay 28$ for a few bags of noodles and they have free shipping. C'mon House Foods!! 10$?"
"you can find the sogo sweet rice mochi at Costco now, just 7bucks sth<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0042TR2WE"">Sogo Sweet Rice Cakes Japanese Style Mochi Assorted Flavor Cannister</a>"
"Excellent germination!  Only 4 days and about 90% of the seeds are up to an inch.  If I hadn't done this before, the instructions would have been wonderful, they left nothing out. I WILL buy these again."
"I wish these things weren't so expensive, because they're the only thing that seems to work for my dog's AWFUL breath!"
This is the first time i've had this product and i must say i'm impressed.<br />This is great for cooking and you can use it in most anything! Love it!
"Well, I really wanted to like these but can't. The coffee itself was just ok. Faint smell of vanilla was there as was the taste. My biggest problem with these was the fact that about 1 in 4 plugged up my brewer. I had to take out the K-Cup carriage and stick a paperclip through the hole in the probe that pierces the bottom of the cup due to coffee grounds plugging it up. It seems that the built-in filter in these is bad because the grounds come out and plug the machine. I have tried many other K-Cups and these are the only ones that have ever done that."
Ordered this online as a gift for my husband since he drinks a lot at a local coffee shop in an attempt to save some money.  It's absolutely wonderful and so easy to make.  Saves us a ton of money!
"I was extremely impressed with the single serve Pecan Pies. I expected a middle of the road product, thought I'd give them a try.<br />  The ratio of filling to crust thickness is perfect. Pie has a rich home baked flavor, and the size is wonderful. 2-Ounces is large enough to enjoy without ruining diet. It's satisfying without being overly sweet.<br />  I will be ordering more next month to give one to each guest to take home after Thanksgiving Dinner."
"Having tried a very large number of Earl Grey teas, I've been struck by how particularly flavorful this brand is.  It's really worth trying.  I ended up buying the pack of 6 boxes twice I liked it so much."
"My daughter absolutely used to love the original version of the Chick Chick baby food (with Chicken, Sweet Potatoes, and Brown Rice). Unfortunately, the recipe has apparently just been updated (though not reflected on Amazon's page as of 2/24/2012) to include totally different ingredients (except for the chicken). Now my daughter absolutely refuses to eat this product. The consistency and flavor seem to have drastically changed. Hopefully your child will enjoy the new blend, but I wanted to provide a warning for those of you that may have tried the other version..."
"I ordered a box of 24 of the variety pack of these after trying a couple of different flavors from my cafeteria at work.  This is a really great alternative to chips and they are really flavorful.  I typically take a sandwich to work everyday and was buying a small bag of pretzels or baked chips in the cafeteria.  I found these and they have the same texture as a chip, but have fewer calories and taste better.  After trying the variety pack, I really love the BBQ flavor the best.  My husband really loves the sea salt and vinegar flavor.  I do enjoy the cheddar potato as well, but we are subscribing to receive the BBQ and the salt and vinegar on a periodic basis since those are our favorites.  The original is rather plain, the parmesan and garlic is very garlicky, the salt and pepper is OK, but I'm just not a huge pepper fan so I'm probably not a good judge.  I really don't enjoy the sour cream and onion which is interesting because I do enjoy that flavor with other chips.<br /><br />So bottom line, great chip, great alternative to other chip options.  Low calorie, low fat, and the subscription option is really convenient since I can't seem to find the individual bag option at any store in my area."
I have a lab puppy that is starting to put on too much weight. No surprise there. I thought some search for food toys would work well. I have about three different ones now and a couple more treat toys. He will barely touch this. He loves rubber and the hard plastic seems to bother him. He is smart and can get some of the food out but then gets frustrated and walks off. He is extremely food driven so this was a huge surprise to me. It sits on the floor with food in it and he will just walk by. I have another hard plastic food dispenser that has similar results with him.  He is also an aggressive chewer so I figured he would just chew the rope off. But he doesn't even do that. Know your dogs preferences when purchasing these types of food toys.
"When a product is past its ""best by"" date, that fact should be revealed so we can decide whether to risk it.  These were stale, hard, inedible caramels."
"(Three times I've tried to post a review of these and it never goes through... forgive my abruptness.)<br /><br />Popchips? As in, potato chips puffed like popcorn? You got it, bub. Surprising lightness to them--much more so than expected, which allows the taste of the toppings (in this case, chili lime) to seem supercharged. This can be a good thing or not, depending on how sensitive your tongue is. Also, the texture is passing strange at first. Takes a bit of getting used to, but once you're used to it, you'll be popping these like, well, popcorn."
I received my product in a timely fashion and was exactly what I expected! I would recommend this to anyone!
"My dog loves these things more than any other treat we've ever bought her, but they are pricey.  This supplier sells them for half what the pet chains do and shipping is free."
Nantucket Blend is my favorite. Not too strong yet has that satisfying flavor. I had tasted this blend before so I had a head start on its fine quality.
"Hershey ""Sugar Free Caramel Filled Chocolates"" are very good diabetic friendly chocolate candies. These are fairly small, but are very tasty.<br /><br />Sweetened with Splenda, these do not significantly impact my blood sugar levels or cause gastric distress.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH"
This Hot chocolate is very good. It has just the right amount of milk chocolate flavor. The price is a very good deal and more than worth it!
"My baby does not like this kind. I do not like it either, it tastes sour. The taste of tomato is too strong. Tomato has lycopene, a antioxidant for good health, but my son just won't eat. He like other happy baby productx like spinah, mango and pear, blue berries, banana and beet and broccoli, pear and peas. This one needs seasoning or I will not eat it either."
"Used too make syrup for canning our peaches this year.  It worked great, doesn't seem too raise the blood sugar on my<br />husband which is diabetic.  Gives the peaches a fresh, sweet taste.  Not bitter like most of the artificial sweeteners.<br />Can't use splenda, because of allergies.<br /><br />Good in everything I've used it in.  Will continue too buy.  Great product"
My little girl doggie loves these..and great for her teeth.  Less expensive than at the pet store when I buy four it's like getting one free!  Great product!
"I purchased this product because of its name, ""Rumford NATURALS Corn Starch"" (the word ""Naturals"" appears large and clear on the pictured product label). Also, the Amazon description said it was made from ""Non-Genetically Modified Corn"". The label on the product that I ACTUALLY received does NOT say Rumford NATURALS, but it is still MADE WITH Non-Genetically Modified Corn. I say ""made with"" because this product now contains more than ONE ingredient. Its ingredients are: Cornstarch, Calcium Sulfate*, and ONE of the suggested servings (1 Tblsp) contains 15% of the ""Daily Value"" of CALCIUM. That makes this product potentially a good source for dietary calcium supplementation. ON THE OTHER HAND, for persons who must restrict their calcium intake (example, some persons with kidney stones), it can pose a potential problem, even danger. Amazon provides themselves with a nice ""out"" for this. They list the following: Legal Disclaimer: ""Actual product packaging and materials may contain more and different information than what is shown on our website. We recommend that you do not rely solely on the information presented and that you always read labels, warnings, and directions before using or consuming a product."" BUT, IT IS NOT FAIR FOR AMAZON TO NOT AT LEAST LIST THE CORRECT INGREDIENTS AND PHOTO OF THE PACKAGE SO THAT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO ORDER THE PRODUCT IN ORDER TO ""READ LABELS"" AND FIND OUT WHAT YOU HAVE PURCHASED.<br /><br />I WILL NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN:<br /> * because I don't need extra calcium<br /> * because I don't believe that the Calcium Sulfate was added out of interest in the consumer's health<br />  but to make the product cheaper to produce so it can be priced competitively with other brands<br />  and still be touted as having been made from/with Non-Genetically Modified Corn<br /> and just on principal because I can't afford to throw it away and did not want the hassle of returning it.<br /><br />I am very, very displeased with Amazon's incorrect listing of the product, which was brought to their attention when I purchased it in February 2012, and so far nothing has been done.<br /><br />*Although Calcium Sulfate is considered a safe food additive it is basically the same thing as Plaster of Paris. AND, if you use too much of this product (basically the same amount as I had previous used of pure CORN STARCH), the very stiff sediment in the bottom of the cooking container (I make pudding in Pyrex in a microwave and usually stir it only every 30 seconds) will remind you of damp plaster!"
"Usually I buy spicy Shake N' Bake seasonings, so I was prepared to be a little disappointed when I tried my sample of the Original Pork breading. It turned out to be pretty tasty - the crispy breading added a subtle flavor to the pork and didn't overpower it. Add some rice or pasta and a side of vegetables and you've got yourself a healthy, home-cooked meal with little hassle. I'll make a note to buy more of the original flavor in the future."
I absolutely loved this coffee.  I took it to coffee club and everyone agreed it was some of the best coffee they have ever had!
"Our dachshund LOVED this jug!  But once she really learned how to do it she wound up doing it so hard<br />that the jug would slam back and hit her.  She didn't apparently mind that but it broke her right canine tooth. Hence, this cost us $2500 for a route canal!!!"
"For folks thinking about trying this: please keep in mind that this blend is a FRENCH ROAST. As such, it will not taste like Folgers or Eight o'Clock, or whatever regular coffee you're used to drinking. French Roast really describes how the coffee beans are roasted: rather than being removed from the roaster as soon as the beans crack (which is what happens with lighter blends), they're left in until the crack a second time. The result is a very strong, very dark, very full-bodied coffee which is -- by nature -- lower in acid than other blends. That said, if you're used to the lighter blend, this WILL smell incredibly strong and even over-powering. I, however, love French Roast for my first cup of the day since it's basically like drinking an extra-large espresso.<br /><br />As for this particular product, I was somewhat annoyed by the 'low acid' claim since ALL French Roast coffee is lower in acid than lighter roasts. But, setting that aside, I found this to have a wonderful, deep flavor and more body than any grocery-store 'French roast'. (Yes, Folgers, I'm looking at you!) I'm no longer a regular French Roast drinker, but I'd be happy to brew this the next time the mood for a deep, strong, full-bodied coffee strikes."
We bought this to use with recipes for our Tagine.  This is an amazing spice and at an excellent price! Will buy from again
I am glad I was able to find these on this site. I love this flavor and they are so crunchy. The box is packed inside another box but still some bags end up as crumbs. Most of the bags survived in tact.
"I have the regular my K cup accessory that comes with the Keurig, but you have to insert the special holder and fill the filter each time, then wash them both out.  I like these because they are disposable.  And I can fill several at one time and have them ready in the refrigerator when I want them.  Very convenient."
I got this for a gift for my father and he loved them.  I will probably get them again but only as a gift due to the cost of sausages.
"The only way we could make Switch Orange-Tangerine drinkable was mixing 50/50 with club soda. It was just way too sweet. It then tasted good, but Orangina and San Pelligrino both have awesome Orange flavored sodas out there with no need to mix! And surprisingly, imported San Pelligrino comes out to be cheaper because the cans are larger (11.3 oz. as opposed to 8 oz)."
"I love Popchips. They are a lot different than regular potato chips, but they are quite good. Sea Salt and Vinegar and Chili Lime are my two favorite flavors, and I'd like to try Parmesan Garlic one day (they don't seem to be sold in my area for some reason). Popchips are lower in calories and fat than most regular potato chips, which makes them a healthier alternative when you're looking for something crunchy to snack on. I like to take them to movies (in those rare theatres that don't have 'no outside food' signs) to eat in lieu of butter-laden popcorn. If you're on the fence about buying these, I would recommend trying a small bag to see if you like them before buying one of these big multi-pack deals. I've seen them at a lot of grocery stores--that's where I buy mine. They really are quite different from regular potato chips, but they're tasty and definitely worth trying."
"I love the taste of the Viva Coco with Pineapple. If I was likening it to a common drink, it's a melted virgin Pina Colada.<br />The 17 oz boxes are better for me than the other sizes, because they contain the resealable lids in case you don't drink it all at once.<br />As with all coconut waters, the taste can vary slightly, but the pineapple seems to keep it pretty consistant."
"I see that Dare has decided to cut-down on the filling, the cookies tasted the same, but i like them the way there were.  This was my second order and I was truly disappointed.  I open my box to find broken cookies and cookies that has been in heat and the middle has melted.  The quality was very poor.  I don't know who I should contact for a refund for the broken and melted cookies.  Can you help with this?? If this is not rectified- i will not be ordering any more.  Anybody out there want a box of broken cookies???<br /><br />After making my review, I recieved an e-mail from Amazon, they agreed to refund the cost of my damaged cookies.  I was shocked to see a company with compassion and honesty for their customers....they truly strive to provide good quality customer service.  This is very rare these days, but it is good to know a company out there truly cares.<br /><br />Thank you,"
"This candy is quite good. I know it has to be sent cold but let it get down to room temperature and the taste and texture is quite amazing. The only issue I had with it is that since it's a pound or two in a single bag, the licorice gets wrapped up in itself and it's hard to pull it apart with alot of effort. Great Product overall though!"
MY DOG LOVES THEM. SHE GETS THEM EVERY MORNING AFTER SHE GOES OUT. SHE WON'T SETTLE DOWN UNTIL AFTER SHE HAS ONE. SHE WON'T LET ME FORGET ABOUT THEM. SHE LOOKS FOWARD TO IT EVERY DAY.
"If you're looking for a never-fail, works-every-time dog treat, look no further. Far superior to any other chicken jerky we've tried, and we've tried at least six. Terrific product at a very good price."
I drink this delicious tea almost every day.  I have yet to find anything like it on the market.
"I've tried a wide selection of k-cups including the big names like Starbucks, Tully's, Donut House, Dunkin Donuts, etc and they all have something in common.. either too watery (weak) or too bitter (strong). I tried Breakfast in Bed based on the reviews and I was not disappointed. It's flavorful without being strong or weak. It's hard to get a cup of coffee from a Keurig that tastes like it was brewed like a normal coffee machine.. this k-cup is the exception.. I'll be stocking up."
"Attiki honey has an excellent sweet natural flavor, is very thick, and quite possibly is the stickiest substance known to man. I would like to try some baklava made with this honey. After tasting this honey, I suspect some US honey suppliers are artificially sweetening their product. Attiki is sweet without being over-powering. Pricier than your standard supermarket honey, but well worth it. Recommended."
Believe that it is not right to sell a package of 7 boxes of McVitie's Digestive Biscuits less than a month before they were scheduled to expire on April 2011.  If I had known you were going to do that I would not have bought them.<br />Please do inform your customers the expiration date when you advertisement on your website.
"I have tried Herrs, UTZ, wise, pringles, lays etc....but Kettle tasted the best. The quantity of salt used is the optimum which is required.<br /><br />Although they say serving size 1 ounce, you will finish the whole packet in no time. Total calories is 300 for 2 ounce bag. This is slightly on the higher side. But still it is ok, as they have not compromised on the taste.<br /><br />Only issue was that all packets have some burnt chips, which taste bad. Kettle should take care when packing to ensure no burnt chips are there.<br /><br />Thanks to Amazon to get 24 bags for just 12 bucks with free shipping using their coupon."
"There's not much I can say that hasn't already been said. But when I brewed this coffee I really wasn't expecting to like it at all, seeing as I don't normally like coconut flavored things. But I really like the blend of flavors. To me it doesn't really taste like coconut as much as it does just tropical-ness in general. It's like.. palm tree flavored coffee. And the flavor isn't too overpowering at all, it still has a nice coffee taste. It's just right."
"It's great to have these little packets.  As I eat in a galley for my three meals, I don't want to lug around a heavy bottle of ranch dressing with me.  Now I can just take a small packet.  Hooray!"
This is an awful coffee. The flavor is extremely weak and tastes more like a lemon grass tea than coffee.
Be advised. You will only receive 1 (one) box. They are less than $3.00 in the local grocery store. Will not purchase again.
I have three toy fox terriers and they a crazy over the Duck and Sweet Potato Treats. This product is Awesome!!! Your dogs will love them!! Smokehosue products are the best. I buy several different kinds of their Treats for my dogs. The Chicken Breast Strips are another favorite for my dogs. I don't think there is one of Smokehouse Treats that my dogs don't like.
"Item not as pictured or described. Smaller, much smaller. Tho I will admit the one I got was in good condition, it wasn't what I expected.  Green is beginning to yellow at the bottom ends where attached to trunk.... It was wrapped pretty tight but no fragile on box or other such info for postal carefulness just some packing peanuts thrown in the box... Wish it was more as pictured but for 12.00 I can work with it!"
I was worried after ordering this product since so many reviews complained about dented cans but I ordered when the price was right and took the chance. Out of 12 cans only one was dented. The expiration date on the cans I received: 2014. Very happy with the quality of this pumpkin.
We have developed into loving Indian food and have found a lot of the brands on site have some inconsistent quality or taste.  Sanskriti has a just a great taste and freshness that we haven't experienced in the other brands.<br /><br />What I really like was the quality was great and the prep-time was less five minutes for a great side dish and base for other Indian meals.<br /><br />Highly recommend
"This is our fave Kcup coffee! with GM Half Caff coming in 2nd place.  Nantucket is smooth, not bitter.  Good buy :)"
"I don't know how people could say this doesn't smell or taste bad. It is horrible!! I was getting raw goat's milk for quite a while and when we moved it wasn't available. The fresh raw milk was delicious and mild and did not have that gamey odor and flavor that this milk has. Maybe some people don't mind the taste, maybe some acquire a taste for it, and maybe some even like it, but I think it is vile. If you like the taste of the goat's milk cheese in stores, then you may like this, if not, stay far, far away!"
"I had been trying to find the full sized Tootsie Rolls for some time now and came up empty.  I was excited to find them on Amazon.  They arrived quickly and were fresh.  The only complaint that I have is that the description misleading is misleading. The description says that they are the ""Giant"" bars, but in fact, they are just the regular full size bars."
"I buy these through the ship-and-save program because they are a staple of my breakfast and midday snack routine.<br />Light, flavorful, and full of vitamins, these only take 20-25 minutes to bake with minimal extras. I am vegan so I use egg substitutes  (3 tbsps flax seed in place of the eggs with 9 Tbs water) and they still bake perfectly."
"Tried this because it is 100% Kona and much cheaper than the other national brands I have been using. What can i say i am greatly surprised. Mild, no bite too it and no discernable acidity. This is on my shopping list from now on."
"I first had the opportunity of having this tea about 13 years ago.  The blend used for this tea is very smooth.  I have tried several other chai green tea brands, but none can compare to Yogi Tea.  I have allowed several friends, and co-workers to sample this tea, and all are hooked on it.  I have also tried the redbush chai, and black chai teas from Yogi Tea, all were very good but the taste of the chai green is superb by far.  Follow the directions, allowing the tea to steep, to get the full effect, you won't be disappointed.  I usually use white sugar only as a sweentener, but have also used Equal sweetener.  Thank you Yogi Tea for a wonderful tea."
"I'm not picky about coffee. I'll drink just about any dreck that's been sitting in a pot, mug or carafe for a day or two. Just heat it up and serve me. Normally, I use a one-cup instant bag with boiling water and I get a fairly decent cup of coffee from Folgers using theirs or any store knock-off.<br /><br />Those taste like gourmet compared, and are certainly much better than the ""coffee"" I made this morning from Puroast's French Roast 3-ounce bag.<br /><br />Many reviewers here have stated it tastes like gas, ashes, fuel and I agree. Add to those descriptions a hint of motor oil, old basement and a sprinkle of dog dander.<br /><br />I opened the container and was greeted with an ashy, somewhat mildew-like odor. Oh well, keep going, I say. I boiled water and let a bag steep in the pot for a while as I don't like drip. I feel you get a much better full flavor from steeping. It took a while for the dark color to appear, but soon it looked very coffee-like and I put some in a mug. I smelled it first, noticing that it lacked a standard coffee scent. Then I tasted it with exactly the result I was expecting, a decidedly un-coffee flavor. Stale, with a hint of dried leaves? That's the best I can come up with. So, I added sweetener (stevia) and my usual cream (vanilla soy milk). It still tasted nothing like real coffee to me.<br /><br />I didn't give the mug a chance to comfort my stomach, poured it out and made a regular cup of joe that I could drink. Seriously, this is simply not a good product in my estimation. The only reason I gave it two stars is because I guess in a dire emergency this drink could possibly give you enough caffeine to limp, crawl or otherwise slither out to a store to buy actual coffee or at least be served something warm by the Red Cross."
"I tried these chips looking for a healthy snack and they are quite tasty.  The packing/shipping however leaves a lot to be desired.  My box came completely smashed up and all the bags are crushed, with only about 1/4 of the chips in each bag actually intact. The rest are crumbs and dust.  VERY disappointed in the packaging.  There should be a box within a box and some type of protection..ie packing peanuts."
"Agree with the reviewers who pointed out this is too watery, acidic, and tomatoe-y. It doesn't taste like beef at all. It's a little sweet from the tomato, not in a good way. I think it's a problem with all Happy Baby foods I've tried--they are all sweet, maybe to appeal to baby's tastes. This works well for the fruits and veggies, but not so much for the meat and chicken. I want my baby to eat savory food too! The texture was not appealing--very mushy with some quinoa globs. Again, where's the meat? I guess I'll stick with the fruit pouches, and make my own baby meats, which my girl loves."
Greenies are given to both of my Westies and they expect one a day when they complete their morning routine.  Best treat ever.
"I was looking forward to this mix remembering wonderful Swedish pancakes we used to have in VA. Unfortunately, this mix didn't produce anything close to that - they turned out to be a tasteless version of French crepes. The pancakes also had a vague smell of fish. Considering that now I am stuck with 6 boxes, I am quite disappointed."
I was a bit disappointed in these.  They crumble very easily and have an unusual texture.  My son (6) does not like them.
"Do not buy these for your dog! I made the mistake of not researching Greenies Dental Chews online before buying these. If you Google the Greenies and how sick it may make your dog you will be shocked these are still on the market. Dogs have died eating this deadly poisonous treat.<br /><br />I saw the reviews on this product and I bought the teenies for my Yorkshire Terrier and gave it to him at night after his dinner. I figured since its for 5-15 lb dogs and his first time, I'll give him just half of the teenie. The next morning he didn't eat and he threw up bile and some of the food he ate from the night before. And remember I only gave him 1/2 a piece; imagine if I gave him an entire piece, it might get obstructed in his intestines.<br /><br />I complained to Amazon and they wanted to send me a replacement. Seriously? Like after all that for making my dog sick, you think that I should try it again? Plus they wanted the Greenies back. For what? To resell this poison? They wouldn't even mail me a box to return it. Eventually they just decided to send me a refund and that I can discard the Greenies.<br /><br />I just want to warn pet owners of this danger. There are plenty of similar complaints on this product if you research online. Please take care of your pets!"
"We are typical Americans who know we should eat better, but often don't because ""health"" food is usually expensive and frankly doesn't taste that good.  That is why we are so thankful to have found Mrs. May's products!!  They are all very healthy and quite tasty, and ordering them from Amazon keeps the cost down.  My son's a golfer, and I am always looking for portable, healthy snacks for him to tuck in his golf bag.  Mrs. May's products fit the bill nicely."
"This is a good high fiber breakfast cereal with a high protein content.  It does contain some sodium, but has a good potassium/sodium ratio.  It has some sugar content (evaporated cane juice) and a good flavor.  It generally is found in health food sections of larger supermarkets or in health food stores, and is now available on the Internet.  My main complaint is that retailers do not generally carry the hot cereal equivalent (which I managed to get my friend Lisa to carry in her health food store)."
"The almonds tastes all right. Since it is too dry, the salt can hardly stay on surface. Therefore, it is not salty enough. On the whole, it is a healthy snack. I hope this type of almonds can have subscription service and discount."
"Our Chussel's Love these toothbrush treats. When I ask them if they want to brush their teeth, they jump a mile high to get them. It dosent help their breath to to much, but I know its keeping their teeth clean. Also these are a little on the expensive side almost everywhere, Amazon has the best price. Thanks Amazon."
This is probably the best flavored coffee I and my co-workers have ever had.  We all share in the purchase of the K cups but this is everyones favorite.  Very distinctive Chocolate and Raspberry flavours and the smell is delicious just awesome.
"By accident, saw a lady pick this up in the grocery store.  She told me to try it and went on and on about it.  I bought a pack.  Wow!  Went back and bought all that was left on the shelf, about 7.  Gave some to kids and kept one for me.  Now the store where I purchesed it doesn't carry it anymore.  Thank goodness for Amazon.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed.  You will be delighted you purchased it.  I promise."
"They are good but need more cheese and wish they were krinkle cut. I much prefer the salt & pepper just for the krinkle cut - they have a better texture. All around this brand is much better than Frito-Lay and a good price on Amazon when you get free shipping. These are similar to Tim's or Zack's chips in that they are very crispy.<br /><br />On a side note, these are the hardest bags to open by hand. I have to use a knife or scissors everytime."
"I was buying Quaker Oats granola bars but these Nature Valley chewy bars are better tasting, they make a great snack when I'm on the go. Chocolate, peanuts and raisins...it doesn't get any better."
This is great as a pancake mix.  It almost has a corn texture to it.  I rate everything by if my son will eat it.  He is super picky and loves the pancakes.  I tried making biscuits with the mix that didn't turn out very well but as far as pancakes it rocks.
"I'm not a proffessional chef or anything, but I've been quite happy with the product.  I recieved it in a few days - they were quick."
"Would have rated no star if available.  Beefeaters® Chicken Liver Freeze Dried Treats for Dogs, are a product of China, and irradiated ""for your protection"" according to the company's hold message.  Called Amazon.com customer service, and requested a full refund with pre-paid returned shipping.  Too bad none of this is in the product description.  Amazon CSR was very helpful, and very cooperative, postage paid shipping label received via email immediately.  Thank you, Amazon.com!"
"I made one for my daughter's birthday party and everyone but her died of uranium poisoning. Still tasted pretty good, though."
"I used to work in a specialty pet store, and cats were my specialty. I was the expert on diet after spending much time researching various foods, reading labels, and talking to customers. I'll share what I learned, and explain why I recommend this food. Science Diet is one of the worst foods for cats, and right down at the bottom you'll also find Purina, Meow Mix, Eukanuba, and Iams. These have by-products, fillers (corn, soybean mill run, corn gluten, grits, or white rice).<br /><br />Many of the better foods like Blue Buffalo, Artemis, Wellness, Instinct, Orijen, California Naturals, Innova Evo, Merrick, and my personal favorite Vet's Choice Health Extension are world's apart in quality and most are cheaper than Science Diet pound for pound in many stores.<br /><br />These are the ingredients for a typical Science Diet bag minus the vitamins/minerals, just to give you an example:<br /><br />Ground Whole Grain Corn, Chicken By-Product Meal, Animal Fat, Dried Beet Pulp, Soybean Oil, Dried Egg Product, Flaxseed.<br /><br />Corn is a filler, and it's the number one ingredient. By products are things like beaks, feathers, etc. They're waste products. The only decent ingredients are down the ingredient list, meaning that they exist in a smaller amount then the first ingredients. Now, let's look at a bag of Health Extension that's both cheaper AND of higher quality:<br /><br />Chicken, Chicken Meal, Brown rice, Oats, Dried Egg Product, Chicken Fat, Flaxseed, Menhaden Fish Meal, Herring Oil, Sweet Potato, Cranberries, Blueberries, Tomato Pomace, Natural Barley Malt, Apple Cider Vinegar, Goji Berry, Garlic, Astragalus, Ginger, Blue Green Algae + 6 kinds of probiotics.<br /><br />The potato is a nice binder and good for digestion. The oils and flaxseed are good for the coat being rich in Omegs 3's. The probiotics regulate digestion. The eggs and chicken are good sources of protein. You might not *need* some of the extra ingredients like Goji berry for example, but they're better than fillers and at the very least harmless to cats.<br /><br />I recommend this food because my cats love it, it's relatively cheap for a quality food, and the ingredients are top-notch. If you want better food, go with Instinct (which my cats love even better, especially the rabbit) but be prepared to pay much more. The absolute best would be to put your cats on a raw diet using pucks of meat prepared by various companies, or simply do it yourself if you've researched how to prepare it, but this is an even more expensive route."
"Our black lab devoured this thing in 10 minutes, and at $6 a pop, that's way too much money for a dog treat.  Don't bother getting this."
"Puroast Low Acid Coffee Low Acid Coffee French Roast is not a coffee that I will try again. It was very, very bitter.  Some may like the bitter French Roast, but I do not. I found it to be unpalatable.  I sweetened the coffee and added cream to try to tone down the bitterness, but that did not work. I was left with an undrinkable cup of coffee.  Sorry, Puroast, I cannot recommend this product!"
"I got this because everyone says it's great for your dog to play with when he's alone. My dog has several treat dispensing toys to keep him busy: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001B11L46"">Atomic Treat Ball Interactive Dog Toy, 3-Inch</a> , <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ARUKTG"">Ourpets DT-10504 Smarter Toys IQ Treat Ball , 5 Inches , Colors may vary</a>, and Kong Puppy Kong Toy Medium. He does really well with all of them, the atomic being his favorite and the Kong coming in a close second because he really has to work to get stuff out of there. The Tug a Jug just does not work at all for him, though. I put tiny treats in there and it is physically impossible for him to get the treats out. If you're lucky, the rope will catch on one of the treats and you might be able to wiggle one out that way, but that would still require him to be holding the jug and tugging the rope which hardly ever happens. If that doesn't work, you have to tip the jug to get anything out and, well, my dog can't do that since he doesn't have thumbs. I'm glad I got this on clearance at CVS otherwise I'd be a little peeved at paying so much for a toy that doesn't work."
"These are very healthy 7 grains and very light and crispy, perfect with dips or salsa.  Tastes just like rice cake.  They are very easy on the teeth too, for those who have dental work that they don't want to chip. Hard to find in supermarkets."
"The taffy was not good.  Seemed to be old, somewhat sponge like.  Wrote to the company and have been taken care of.  Appreciate the good customer service.  Thanks"
"If you are looking for non-sweetened lightly flavored sparkling water you couldn't do better than TalkingRain.  It comes in several flavors, but my favorite is Berry.  I have always enjoyed carbonated drinks, but so many are too sweet.  Drink too many of those and you end up needing to diet.  With TalkingRain there is no such problem.  And if you don't particularly like plain water, this is the solution.  When my son-in-law tasted it I had to double my order."
"I have ordered the 7-pack of these Digestive Biscuits several times. They are delicious with a cup of tea, and are a slightly healthier version of a ""cookie"" but with more fiber and perhaps not as sweet as the traditional cookie. I agree with previous reviewers that Amazon packaging has been insufficient in the past, resulting in crumbled and crushed biscuits. However, my most recent shipment (ordered January 8, 2012)arrived in nearly perfect condition, in improved packaging, with all biscuits intact. Since this brand is difficult to find in a regular grocery store, I highly recommend purchasing from Amazon with Prime shipping!"
"This coffee was really good.  Been trying to find it in New York, but haven't been able to.  I think it's worth the few extra bucks to get it delivered.  I've ordered twice now and each time the coffee comes fresh and still very aromatic.  Also, I think the caffeine content is pretty high, as I'm more awake on this brand then other brands like starbucks and fairway market brands."
"Quick ship, good quality, what a great product to add unique flavor to grilled veggies and mashed / roasted potatoes.  A little bit goes a long way. Thanks"
Always try try to ration my spice usage. Getting a fresh batch and smelling and tasting the change in my dishes made me realize how I've been cheating myself by being thrifty. Use it or loose it. So much less expensive then retail grocery.
"Tasted good. Spicy. Those that don't like spicy should stay away from this. For the price paid, very good buy."
"So i had this cheese on my mind ever since trying it at a restaurant in SF.  This was one of those things that i though when Im bored and want to burn money on shipping i would order.  Is it worth it?  Yes if you are a cheese fan,  goes great with any wine).  Not so much if you are being curious."
"The containers explode at the end of the brewing cycle. The grinds fill the cradle that the K-Cup sits in and it is messy to clean up. Newmans and Tilly's work fine, but Emeril's does not. I have a Mr. Coffee powered by Keuring coffee maker."
My teenage daughter and all of her friends keep eating these. They are really tasty and the chili lime is my personal favorite. It's a good thing that they send a whole case because my daughter says her friends are hooked!
"I'm a big fan of the carbs, fat and protein balance of these crisps. The salt isn't overpowering and the taste is OK. I've had better soy chips (Genisoy Tortilla Chips) but these are alright if you don't like the crunch of a chip."
I've been using this all natural cat food for a few years when I could afford it but didn't think to shop where I buy my books.  With free shipping I only wish Amazon offered a few more flavors.  Since many commercial cat foods are made with Grade D mest (not fit for human consumption) I am delighted to have this choice.
We bought both brands to try and found this one with much less chocolate taste then Cafe Escapes dark chocolate.  It was also thinner in consistency. Won't buy again
Purchased these for first time.  No second time.  The beans will not soften up nor will the pasta.
"Somehow I missed the word spice. I wanted Peach tea, but this is black tea with clove and orange peel flavoring.  I wanted to get off of black tea as it  can cause low hemoglobin which is not good for folks who want to donate blood regularly.  Unfortunately, although this is advertised as peach, it is just black tea."
"First, I want to review the product itself. I've used this brand of canned pumpkin before, so it was not new to me. I find the flavor to be a little more like a fresh pumpkin and the texture to be a little less creamy than mass market brands. But not to a degree where it causes problems in any of the recipes I use it in. The cost per can of ordering here on Amazon is less than what the local natural food store I usually buy it at sells it for. And since they were very low on stock last time I bought it and had no expected restocking date, I figured the savings and availibility made it worth the risk of ordering online even after reading the reviews.<br /><br />Which leads me to the packaging. Yes, as many other reviewers have reported, cans were dented. The outside packaging along with the other items in my order were in perfect condition, it was not until I got to the ""ready to ship"" flat of cans that were pre-packaged by the manufacturer that I found any damage whatsoever. 8 of the 12 cans had dents. However, they are only small dents and don't affect the safety or quality of the product in any way. I wouldn't have hesitated to purchase the cans off of a store shelf in this condition since the product is in very short supply, so it isn't a problem for me."
"These bars have a core of unappetizing protein goo, covered with a thin sheath of white chocolate analog. It didn't taste like white chocolate and even my roommate couldn't stomach these."
Hi! I could eat a box of this vegan jerky at one sitting. Delicious! The hickory smoke flavor is mildly hot without burning. There's to be a hint of maple syrup or similar tasting spice in the flavor. Texture seems right. Chewy but soft enough. The strips came in an outer paper box. Easy enough to open. The individual wrappings are easy to open with scissors. Tougher to open by hand. Individual wrapping has a cut at top for peeling open. I had no luck that way. For taking these on a hike it's a good idea to bring scissors. I recommend this jerky for a great snacking experience. I hope to buy other flavors in future orders.
"Ola's coffee is low or acid free so I can enjoy without stomach problems, that's a fact but the reality is that this coffee is very good tasting and so smooth.  Never a burnt taste."
"[[ASIN:B007IK5QZO Kirkland Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil] ]<br />I purchased this olive oil based on testing performed by University California Davis back in early 2010.(I've found of no new testing since then) The results rated Kirkland Brand extra virgin olive oil (3 samples provided for testing), and it was the only imported oil to the United States of 14 tested that passed.(not sure what the test were)The oil tastes very complex (like fine wine) very fruity and sharp(to me). Only EXTRA VIRGIN is made from the (First cold pressing) first pressing olives and offers(They say) up to 200 antioxidants,great taste and all the nutrients that olives have to offer.(that is why it's cloudy unfiltered) After I open the main container which I keep it in freezer and place a small container in refrigerator and refill as necessary keeping it away from light & heat at all times. Enjoy it's worth the extra $$....."
"Someone brought these to a party we had last month and I didn't put them out because the buffet was full and didn't think anyone would like saltless potato chips.  Last week we had some friends over and these were all I had in the pantry so I put them out.  OH MY GOSH THEY ARE SO GOOD!  I was so wrong to think they would be bland; they are full of real potato flavor, wonderfully crisp and very fresh tasting.  I am here on amazon to buy a case, I only want to have these with dips.  Truly delicious!"
Szechuan peppercorns are different than anything within the usual American spice repertoire.  If you haven't tried them before; do so!  They are wonderful. These peppercorns were just as expected; seemed fresh.  The price was right.  Shipping was fine.
"My dog, a Great Pyrenees, has a few food allergies (rice, chicken, eggs, soy, nuts) and is picky about the food he eats. I was feeding him Orijen 6-Fish and, after a few months, he decided to stop eating it.  After trying a few different foods I heard about Pinnacle Trout and Sweet Potato.  He loves it and it agrees with his digestive system.  I order it from Amazon because the price is lower than the local pet stores in my area. With Amazon Prime, it arrives in 2 days.<br /><br />Four stars because I do need to mix the last quarter of the food with the next bag (treating it like a new dog food - I didn't need to do that with Orijen 6 Fish).  Highly recommended."
"My sister in law was up for a visit this weekend, so I thought it's be a perfect time to test out this coffee.  Neither of us were impressed.  It didn't have a great flavor and she thought the texture was a bit oily.  As far as low-acid goes, it did seem like it would be good in that department, but the taste made it so it wasn't worth drinking."
We love these crackers!  They are fresher and crispier when purchased by the box.
"I have tried many sauces from Habanero, to 7 Pod and Trinidad Scorpion, to the Ghost Chilli, and to those not too tasty extracts. And this is the hottest one I have. Hard to believe the hottest pepper in this sauce is the habanero. How can this be hotter than the ghost chilli and others I have. Because of the killer pepper extracts in there. If you can't even handle Ground Zero then don't even look at the final answer. It's ground zero knocked up a million notches. Don't believe me? Try one drop. One drop will leave you drooling and in a lot of pain. It taste pretty bad. It's only meant to taste hot and hurt you. I don't suggest one drop straight on the tongue like I did, put it in chilli or on cheese. But If you gotten up the nerve to try it straight then props to you, enjoy the pain.<br /><br />Worth the money. This small bottle will last you years it's that hot. And cool for any hotsauce collection."
"When these came home, I was less skeptical about what I was getting. The name says it all, oat, coconut and chocolate, in a bar form. Sounds more like a cookie to me. Tasted a lot more like a cookie than a bar that was healthy for me. Which is good. I want to taste my food and know it's healthy, than not want to taste my food while knowing it's healthy. There was plenty of chocolate in the bar for me and it wasn't concentrated in chunk or random chips. The chocolate pieces used had melted nicely, so the chocolate was very prevalent throughout.<br /><br />I definitely could taste the coconut, but it was a more fresh flavor than say something you'd buy in a bag at a store. It also did not overpower the rest of the bar. Coconut is a powerful ingredient. It's good to know it was used in moderation. The oats and the cookie part of the bar lend well into reminding me of a great oatmeal chocolate chip cookie. I could take a bite and got plenty of the cookie texture I want more of, with bits of oat and smaller but still flavorful coconut.<br /><br />I think it'd work well to think of these less as a bar (like a healthy food bar) and more of a great tasting, small cookie."
"My 17 yr old son loves these.  He eats the entire box of bars in two weeks.  Literally.  I like them too, but they rarely last long enough in the house for me to get one.  Chewy, just sweet enough, yum.  Kiddo is gluten free and refined sugar free and these are among his favorite snacks.  I love that they give Mr. 5% Body Fat with the metabolism of, well, a 17 year old boy, enough carbs to get through his school day (33g) in a form that is convenient enough for him to eat between classes.  Lunch alone is not enough, he has to eat between classes.  Yes, I know, if I could get some more protein into his snacks that would stick with him longer, but I also have to send what he will eat, and he eats these, whereas the other bars came back home.  Also, buying in bulk like this is a significantly better price than buying from the co-op."
My dogs favorite treat.  They pass up the other treats for the dried beef liver.  I love the fact it is low in fat and healthy.
These organic energy bites are delicious and work great.  I use them for golf tournaments or long bike rides.  A few bites every half hour and you will have ample energy for hours of activity.
"I had been waiting for my regular coffee to become available again (Jet City Whole Bean Espresso), when I received one container as a gift and brewed it in my drip coffee maker just as it came out of the package.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by this coffee.  I had no real expectations that it would be any good.<br />It was better than most commercial Mainstream coffee, but nothing to rave about.<br /><br />Then I decided to run this ground coffee through my Capresso Conical Burr Grinder (with it set to the finest grind), and lo and behold this coffee was transformed into a pretty damn good cup of coffee. I purchased a pack of 6 and it is the best commercial coffee I have ever used.<br /><br />While I prefer my Whole Bean Jet City, this coffee is far more than just acceptable.<br /><br />So, if your regular coffee is not available, try this one and Grind it on Fine and give it a try.  It will hold you over until your favorite is available and the price was not bad at all."
I used to drink this tea as a child and can no longer find it in stores. It's unlike other cinnamon teas I've tried which are usually blended with other spices or fruity flavors.  This one is just cinnamon and tea - and it's perfect.
"I bought one of the oatmeal from wholefood and fed it to my baby right away. I was happy about it because she loved it. But after a couple of weeks, one day when my Mom fixed the cereal, she asked me why it has the bad smell. I smelled it, and it does(it's not very strong but does has the smell like when all the nuts or rice turn bad)! I smelled the ""Earth's best"" one I have and it smells pefectly normal. Then I remembered I got a Happy Bellies multi-grain cereal before from [...]. It had not been opened and expires on March 2010. I opened it right away and it has a VERY strong bad smell. It makes me sick for several minutes and feel like there will be something fly out of it! I was really scared! You'd better be careful too since baby won't taste it and you may not find it before it's really bad! I feel so sorry for my baby since I know it's really bad to her health, much worse then giving her non-organic cereal. I won't ever buy the product again no matter how my baby likes it. It makes me really upset and I want to give it negative 5 starts if I could.<br />BTW, I submitted this reviw to [...] but they didn't publish it. I just hope everyone smell the oat before you give it to your baby."
"I have tried a lot of different powders, and while I like that this one has fewer calories, the taste is just not that good. It's hard to describe - it actually is very hempy, if you are familiar with the taste. That's fine if you like it, but I didn't think it went well with chocolate. It's also very strong and sweet.<br /><br />There is also very little texture added by the powder, so smoothies made with this are thinner than those made with other protein powders."
"These things are NOTHING like Oreos.You think wow Oreos. Think again. I would say spend your money on something better (the Hershey's or Reese's crisp wafer bars come to mind). My honest view on these ""thin crisps"" cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer, or milk bones."
"Absolutely outstanding, if you like the aroma of Bergamot.  Despite the extemely strong aroma, the Bergamot flavor is not overwhelming (Taylor's aroma is milder, but its Bergamot flavor is completely overwhelming). Most Earl Grey is too subtile for me.<br /><br />Bergamot is probably a learned appreciation.  It is from citrus like a cross between an orange and a lime, with a powerful aroma and flavor of its own (inedible as fruit).<br /><br />You can still taste the tea, and it is great quality.  Add to this Fair Trade, Organic,and a great price, it can't be equaled.<br /><br />So if you like Bergamot aroma, and want enough Bergamot flavor to tell it's there, don't bother looking at anything else."
"This tea is excellent, it has a delicious flavor, and it smells really good. I have to write twenty words.. so, I will just say, buy it with confidence, you won't regret."
"....and it is not related to the product, so the product itself gets 5 stars. I ordered this because the price was comparable to non-organic brands in my local supermarket. Thrilled, I did 'Subscribe and Save'. I fully expected the expiry to be soon, as is often the case with Amazon, but the stamped date was a flmost 3 years from now, yaayyyyy! It is wonderful pumpkin, and a safer can than most brands, double yaayyyy! Not one dented can, another surprise. However, now that I set up auto-ship, the price zoomed up. That seems to happen a lot. I'll probably cancel if it doesn't go back down a bit when I need more."
"These cordials are very hard to find, so I was so excited to find them online, that I ordered 3 bags and have been enjoying them ever since."
These are tasty enough for an emergency snack/lunch--I keep a few in my file cabinet. But our local Meijer's sells them for $1.33 apiece. Even the discount price here is twice that.
someone gave me the jar of PB2.  I thought it was awful...yuck.  thank goodness I didn't actually pay money for it.  It was nasty!!
"First Indiana Jones found the ""Lost Ark of the Covenant"", then the ""Mystical Stone from the Temple of Doom"", then ""The Holy Grail"" and finally the ""Palace of The Crystal Skull""...But the loser still cant find ""The Lost Lakewood Bottle of Real, Honest 100% ""PURE CARROT Juice"" Minus Lemons"" not without ""Short Round"" anyway.<br /><br />I tried to leave ""no stars"" or fewer cuz, I felt and tasted the pain of other misguided customers, I spewed out my first rancid acidic taste of this clearly labeled, ""PURE CARROT"" Juice. Lakewood's knucklehead faux pas is their troglodytian approach to the label design. I can easily read ""PURE CARROT"" and ""PURE"" again, just above the illustration of ""CARROTS ONLY"" (but nada lemons), but in much smaller print at the very bottom of the label and below the CARROTS ONLY illustration (sans lemons), it mentions ""enriched with lemons"", 1% to be exact, which means 99% of their marketing team make O'Donnell look constitutionally wise.<br /><br />Intentional or not, it aint the keenest marketing approach to ""thinking"" consumers. To paraphrase a wiser woman, ""You might want to rethink those ties."" (LABELS in this case)~ E.Brockovich ~.  Even Juicy Juice was smart enough to clear up their ambiguously labeled products.  Today's McFly FYI and word of the day is ""PURE"", and brought to you from my sponsor, ""Merriam Webster"": PURE : unmixed with any other matter. As in Gold, Pure Gold, Jerry. (I watch tv and commercials, does it show?)<br /><br />For an amazing ride courtesy of the ""short bus marketing team"" see the label here:<br />http://www.amazon.com/Lakewood-Organic-PURE-Carrot-Juice/dp/B0000ZSHAK<br />Click on the photo and zoom in to find the 1% of Einsteinian logic or lack there of.  Finding the PURE BS or at least 99.9% requires no zoom, matter of fact arms length, like in a grocery store aisle is close enough to be misdirected.<br /><br />Ok Lakewood, so, think what you will about my criticism be it glib, harsh, frank, curt or possibly even unfair or totally wrong.  On the other hand, I think not but I would love to be proven wrong.  Are you game for a little challenge: Get three 3rd graders, heck even three 3 year olds and give them each 3 crayons, green, yellow and orange.  Now ask them to draw a picture for the label of juice which contains, ""carrots and lemons"" or if your brave enough for a real acid test, ""lemons and carrots.""  All I am saying, is give 3's a chance! In a world of scams, rip-offs and misconceptions and misdirection...be honest and be excellent to one another.<br /><br />No hard feelings, right?<br /><br />Ret Hink aka Curt Frank aka bombastic sarcastic B@5t@rD"
"I have three cats.  Now mind you, all three of theses cats LOVE to eat.  One cat is part Maine Coon and weighs about 28lbs, one is 17-years with a thyroid condition and constantly wants to eat, the third is the Coon's twin and she is a bit of a glutton.  ANyway, each of these cans has about the equivalent of two tablespoons of food and the rest is all liquid.  That was a reall turnoff for my guys.  The actual protein content LOOKS good, but they all three pretty much turned their noses up at it.  I have been using it as my ""emergency supply"" but have to say, I would never buy."
"In my office, and for me personally, this is the smoothest and best tasting coffee you can buy for your Keurig machine. Great price too!"
"One of the problems with flavored baked tortilla chips is since there is no surface fat from frying, the flavor powder has nothing to stick to and the chips end up tasting bland. The Guiltless Gourmet line of flavored chips avoids this problem somehow. I've tried both the ""Mucho Nacho"" and The ""Chipotle"" both were light and crisp with a good amount of the seasoning powder on board. The have great flavor and are considerably lower in calories than a comparable number of fried chips."
"All the cans were dented. Every. One. It is as if a child hammered each one, some several times. Then they were shrink wrapped and put in the box. Is there any quality control here? While Amazon will pay for this 12 pound box of unusable cans to be returned and I will eventually get a refund - what a waste. Once returned there will be no ability for anyone to use this product due to the dents - Botulism anyone? Why would Amazon even bother to ship this product in this unsafe and unusable condition?T hey have paid for round trip shipping of a heavy box for no reason."
sooo happy amazon sells this! the one grocery store that has it in my neighborhood is closing!!!! this is delicious!!! perfect for a fiesta night!
makes nasty loose poo! the dry food does the same thing. i've tried the adult version and the puppy version and both gave my adult dog and my puppy super soft and stinky stools.
"These aren't clearly labeled ""GLUTEN FREE"". They say pretzel sticks and they do not resemble pretzel sticks very closely at all. They are a weird flavor, sort of costly and not worth it. eew."
"Even though we are International Delight fans we were not completely dissapointed by this product. We had no problem with the shipment, but the creamer itself is thinner than International Delight. Other than that we are happy :D"
I have tried 4 times to make cocoa with this product.  Twice it appeared to plug the coffee maker and would only provide about one once of cocoa.  The other two times the product worked correctly.  I do not think it is the coffee maker problem because it has made dozens of cups of coffee with no problems.  So I can not recommend this product.
"I bought these for my dad and husband, who are doing the Atkin's diet. They love them! I live in New Jersey, so pork rinds are not that popular. I describe them to people as Funyuns texture with bacon flavor. They are very tasty, and calorie-wise, you get alot of bang for your buck. They are quite salty, however, which is not a downside for my family."
"I understand many people love these things, but I bought the sea salt and vinegar popchips and I hated them. I LOVE regular  potato chips lay's and other brands. These popchips not only taste bad but they have a bad after taste to me.<br />I think these popchips must be for ""heath"" type people who try to convince themselves these taste good.<br />We like what we like and we all have different experiences about this type of thing.<br />After reading so many positive reviews I thought these would be good.<br />They taste ""hallow"", ""empty"", too artificial chemical taste.<br />With a regular potato chip I get the ""that's it"" sensation, satisfying, full flavor."
"I am a coffee fan who drinks my coffee black; nothing is added to alter the flavor of the coffee. As a result of this habit I find myself somewhat more critical of how a coffee tastes. As a general rule I prefer an Arabica bean but I could not find a reference to bean type on the bag. Curious I checked their web site and found they use the Arabica bean exclusively.<br /><br />On the front of the bag there is reference to the process used to decaffeinate the Rivera Sunset coffee; the Swiss water process is used. Their web site provides a detailed explanation of this process which involves the removal of water soluble caffeine: ""Unroasted coffee beans are immersed in heated water for several hours to remove the water-soluble caffeine present in the beans, as well as those coffee components that easily dissolve in water. The water is then drained from the beans and filtered or processed to remove the caffeine from the water. This decaffeinated water is then reintroduced to the coffee beans, allowing the flavor and aroma components to be absorbed by the coffee. Finally, the coffee is dried and ready for roasting.""<br /><br />More information is provided on the web site concerning the bean growing and selection process; I found the web site to be user friendly and well thought out.<br /><br />Another habit of mine is the use of distilled water to brew coffee; I've found that public water supplies can provide water with a multitude of different tastes which can negatively influence the flavor of the coffee.<br /><br />Let me finally mention the flavor of the coffee itself. First it is very smooth and rich; I almost never have more than one cup of coffee at a time but found myself thinking more would be nice. That is very rare! The coffee had a delicate fruity flavor which I found pleasing.<br /><br />I did face one challenge with this coffee; the bag was very difficult to open without tearing it. After working on it for several minutes, I had decided I was not going to let a bag beat me, I discovered that I was able to open it be starting at the end where the bag was folded back. Once I got my finger inside the bag the rest came comparatively easy. Fortunately the two small tears I made in the bag were high enough to fold under when the bag was closed. The bag recommends storage in a refrigerator.<br /><br />This coffee is pleasant and refreshing and I have enjoyed drinking it; if you are a coffee lover you owe it to yourself to give this coffee a try and see what you think. I hope you're as pleased with it as I am!"
"Roses Lime Juice has that lime flavor that the knock-offs do not have.  Roses has just the right amount of sugar so that it's not too sweet. Great for making any kind of gimlet...vodka, gin or even tequila (my favorite).  Since liquor is expensive don't settle for less than the ""Original"" !"
"I love Panang Curry but would rather avoid the white rice that most restaurants serve with it.  So decided to try making my own, and with this product, I get exactly what I want, hot tasty Panang Curry adding lots of fresh veggies, tofu and brown rice.  And it's very hot, didn't have to add any spices at all.  Great product, will purchase again."
"As far as canned soups go this is ok. I was disappointed with the texture, extra unexpected bits (shell pieces) and overall quality. Having been spoiled by living in Maine for 20 years before relocating to the south, I tried different brands of canned bisque. I have come to the realization that Lobster Bisque is best when made fresh."
Had to buy another box of the same thing at Petsmart. She eats those.  Must not be fresh.  How can you tell when they look the same.
"My baby and I both loved the stage 1 Happy Baby pouches that we tried, so I had high hopes for this as well. To my dismay, it smelled like cat food and was gritty. I expected there to be more morsels of food,  but this was just mush. My son took a few bites and refused to eat any more."
"IF THIS IS YOUR FIRST HAPPY BABY PURCHASE, TRY AGAIN, THE REST ARE AMAZING! I love Happy Baby. My daughter eats this companies products all the time.  Chick Chick is great, Beef Stew is wonderful, but Gobble Gobble is weird.  My daughter didn't mind the taste, but I could not get over the texture.  It looked like a giant blob of wet dog food.  It was more putty-like than any other flavor.  I actually had to cut bites off of it.  I am grossed out just thinking about it.  Good thing there are other flavors."
"I Was sent 3 week past ""Fresh by date"" stock. Chips are noticeably not fresh in taste. Won't order again.<br /><br />EDIT: And just to add to the dangers of expired stock one of the bags had a rat hole in it, black marks on inside of hole very obviously rat. unfortunately I put a chip in my mouth before I saw the hole.<br /><br />Very bad form amazon."
"This is suppose to be a ""healthy"" snack. Then they shouldn't sneak artificial sweeteners in. I do like the taste, but I'm going to have to go with another flavor. I got the applewood also and it looks like it doesn't have sucralose. So just be aware that different flavors will have different ingredients."
"Very tasty and great to give to people. My family knows nothing aboout Japanese candy, and even they got excited when I ordered some. For some reason, some people hate green apple, but it is my favorite flavor!"
I bought this cat food at Tractor Supply. My cats hate this food. They won't eat it.<br />It is so hard my cat's have a hard time trying to eat it. My cats are very unhappy with this food. I would not buy again.
"Switch promises ""A perfect balance between juice and carbonation"" and it does live up to that as it delivers a fresh burst of stawberry and kiwi (the kiwi could have been a little stronger) and less carbonation then your regular sodas.  And it is a bonus that it is 100% Juice with no sugar added and no preservatives<br /><br />My main drawback is the can as the tall thin can is a little too small and regular soda cans that are shorter and thicker and stream out better than the taller, thinner ones like Switch."
"Price was misleading, once the high shipping rate was added, the tea was no longer the 'deal' it was promoted to be. Although once it finally arrived, it was half decent tea, but NOT worth the shipping and the wait, will go to my local tea house next time."
This fancy grade is as good as it gets. You will not be disappointed. This priouct supports the proud Vermont tradition.
Received this item as expected - if anyone has had peanut porridge - this is  as close as it gets to Jamaica !
We have tried several gluten free packaged bread and bread mixes. All the packaged breads taste like cardboard-this mix actually has the consistency of sandwich bread. We use it for sandwiches and to make garlic bread when we have gluten free spaghetti(brush melted butter with garlic powder on one side at a time and brown in a frying pan).
"This is the worst low-carb product I have ever purchased.  When using it to make pizza crust, I could not even cover half the pizza pan, and the taste was horrible.  I used it to make biscuits, and they were incredibly dry and had no flavor.  I tried again, adding some margarine, and they still tasted awful.  I tried to make pancakes, and the batter was as thick as cement.  I tried adding more liquid, but they were horrible.  I cannot imagine how this product is still on the market. Krusteaz used to make WONDERFUL low-carb baking products, so I know it can be done.  This stuff, however, is awful."
"Cons:<br />1. Neither of my children liked the taste. They loved Earth's Best, even the vegetables.<br />2. It is not as convenient as the Earth's Best when travelling since you have to carry a spare container to serve this.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. BPA free packaging<br />2. Organic and preservative free.<br /><br />The lining of the lids in Earth's Best is reported to contain BPA. My search for quality baby food continues..."
Chips Ahoy cookies were not very tasty.  My children and husband would not eat them.  I tried to give them away and everyone refused.
"I recently purchased this popcorn and less than half of the popcorn popped.  And those that did pop were tough. I believe these were old.  I've purchased other brands and they all have an expiration date printed on back each pack.  These had no expiration dates printed, therefore there was no way of knowing how old these were or how long they have been in their stock. I popped the jolly time brand and it popped perfectly.  I also find that this is on the list of things that can't be returned per Amazon.com policy.  I'm going to purchase the Jolly time popcorn at Smart & Finals. Cheaper and there fresh!!!  What a rip off!!!"
"This is the first time we bought this tea from Amazon, we used to get it directly from Revolution Tea. I don't know if that made any difference, or if it was just a change in the tea's composition (along with the packaging), but what used to be my wife's favorite tea now has a metallic smell and aftertaste, with much less of a pomegranate flavor and now a strong, almost cheap-generic-green-tea flavor. Really disappointing, especially since we're stuck with six boxes."
"I was disappointed - supersweet, but just not flavorful.  Same thing with the peppermint.  Will not purchase this brand again."
"I'm sorry but this tastes bad.  You get watery rice (yes I drained it according to instructions, but it still tasted watery), bad flavored sauce, very little chicken.  It's a good idea, but it needs work."
I love these crackers and even serve them to non Gluten Free eaters with great success.  The multi-grain crackers have fennel seeds in them so if you don't like the taste of fennel be sure you get one of the other two flavors.  The original flavor tastes like a cross between a saltine and a ritz cracker and those were my two favorite crackers before I found out I couldn't have gluten.
Not just the name - this is the best chili ever.  This used to be a regular item in our local grocery store but then it was discontinued.  I found it on Amazon.com and love it.  (I do add a little of my own spices at the end to make it spicier.)
"I bought this expecting the ""powdered"" form as it specified and ended up paying for a product I cannot use. The two, granulated(which this IS) and powdered(which it clearly is NOT) are NOT interchangeable within recipes. I felt like I was tricked into buying the wrong product!"
"The first sample came with my single cup brewer. I liked the taste, but when I removed the k-cup the foil had a huge hole in it. It was awkward and extremely messy. I thought it could have been a bad batch, so I bought a 12 pack of decaf. It was the same. Great taste, but very messy. It still had a huge hole, grounds were in my coffee, and weak foil. Disappointed."
"or really my dog loves them.  When I have a busy day and I am too tired to brush her teeth, I just give her one of these instead and they do as they describe:  keep her teeth clean.  They are very soft and easy on her teeth but also rub the leftovers off to keep them clean.  I really recommend these to anybody who has a dog and they also make cat greenies which also work for my barn cats and they love them."
"We are big fans of what we call Tummy Tea.  It helps ease our daughter's discomfort and relaxes her, so she can go to sleep at night, on days when she suffers from stomach aches whose cause the doctor can't seem to pinpoint.  This was a quick, easy transaction, and we bought (4) 6 box packages.  We use this on an almost daily basis sometimes and this amazon price can't be beat, though not by much, it can't be beat even with sale prices that we've found.  So, if you buy more than $25 worth you get free shipping :)  This tea tastes great too!"
"Tried this yesterday as a ""treat"" on a cold, rainy fall night.  It had an unpleasant, grainy and somewhat watery texture.  The clams were actually sandy and gritty and the potatoes were kind of chalky, for lack of a better term.  The flavor was also very lacking...it didn't really taste like, well, anything.  Definitely not worth the price.  I can only imagine the people who wrote the good reviews either work for Bar Harbor or have never tried any other kind of clam chowder."
"I have an immense love for pancakes.  I have been on a search for the best pancake mix for about a year. I did not write this review prematurely as I wanted to give the product a fair chance.  I tried it with whole milk.  I tried it with buttermilk. I tried it with blueberries. I tried it without blueberries.  It is by far the WORST mix I have tried thus far.  The flavor is not good, seems like it needs more sugar.  With blueberries, it is very hard to get the pancakes to cook all the way through without overcooking them.  I really am telling you all the hype on this product has got to be from people that either work for the company lol or have never tried another high quality mix.  I honestly would rather eat pancakes from McDonalds.  Don't waste your money!  (Robbys mix is also wayyyyyyyyyy better and I believe it was cheaper). (may be better for waffles...since I'm stuck with two cans I may try that...ugh!)"
The coffee tasted bitter and like it was burnt.  I cleaned the machine and it still tasted bitter and burnt.  Will not order this again.
"I love coconut but this bar is a disappointment.  The first bite had an odd flavor but after a couple more it got a bit better.  The problem is that it's very oily, they put way too much rice syrup and it's literally juicy with oil when you bite into it.  At 246 calories, 14g fat 33g carbs and 29g sugar, this bar is not worth it at all."
"We've tried many of the K-cups that are available, and this is in our top 3. We prefer a darker, bolder flavor, and this one hits the mark. At the same time it's quite smooth."
"Our dogs love Greenies, but of course, which doggies don't? I bought this for my dashchund and minpin, and it's perfect! A great price for a great product. Who could ask for more."
"Quaker Instant Oatmeal Lower Sugar Maple & Brown Sugar is what you should get if you're interested in this type of oatmeal.  It's still available for purchase and tastes MUCH better than this version.  Skip the box with the picture of the fitness guru giving you 'super' advice and go for the original.  I have no idea what they did to this version but the taste is horrible and very noticeable when you've had the version I've mentioned above.  It's edible, but so are some varieties of garbage, not recommended."
"I have been GF for the past year and have tried all sorts of flour alternatives. This one is certainly the best, and the best part about it, is you can substitute it for any creation that calls for original bisquick. The best so far is the waffles that you can make following the directions on the back. I will be ordering again!! My only complaint is that the boxes are small compared to the other boxes of bisquick available on the shelves."
"I have been ordering Big Train Vanilla and Spiced Chai for just over 2 years on Amazon's subscription.  It was so good and it rivaled the chai at my favorite coffee house (NOT Char-bucks).  I always LOVED it, and enjoyed a cup each morning as I braced for the coming day.  I did, that is, up until several months ago. They seem to have changed the recipe because it just isn't the same.<br /><br />Now I get a numbing sensation on my tongue when I drink it.  If it sits for too long and sediment settles my reaction is really bad...I won't go into details.  The taste is hard to describe, but it is kind of a detergent taste that burns.  I even thought that I had detergent stuck in my mugs from the dishwasher, so I was very diligent in cleaning them before I made a cup.  It didn't help.<br /><br />The flavor was stronger with the spiced chai, so I started getting only vanilla.  Unfortunately, I find the same unpleasant flavor with vanilla as well.<br /><br />I have never used as much mix as the directions say because there was too much that settled out.  Since this started happening, I have reduced the amount I use even more.  That horrible flavor is still there, so I know it isn't related to the way it's mixed.<br /><br />I am very disappointed because, like I said, it was my favorite beverage in the morning.  After trying so many different things over the last 4 months, I have finally selected another brand to try out.  I hope it is as good as this one used to be."
"These bones are just gross.  First of all, they are not wrapped tight enough to keep them fresh.  When you open them up, they just smell old.  They are dry and brittle and break just by touching them.  I gave one to my 2 year old lab and within seconds it was splintering.  I threw the entire pack away, along with the pack of smokehouse knuckles I bought at the same time.  GROSS. I would not recommend these.  Ask the meat man has way better quality products. Real bones for Real dogs, not this fake crap.  Don't buy!"
"I can not believe that this is actually for sale. It needs to be recalled. Sugar is absolutely unhealthy for all your pets. They do not digest/assimilate sugar like we do. Every Vet will tell you  the same thing and you will never see any quality treats or food that has sugar or corn syrup on the ingredient list. If you do see it on the list, DO NOT BUY IT!!"
"I tried another brand of organic brown rice and the babies didn't like it much and became constipated. Then I tried this brand of oatmeal and they loved it. Next I tried this brand of rice and found they love it too, and this one agrees with them. I mix it with water and they gobble it up."
I have purchased these lemon drops for years and the company(Jelly Belly) has discontinued them.  I  bought what I thought was them on Amazon because they are claiming to be the ones from the Jelly Belly Company!  They are not and very disappointed they were misrepresentd as being the original...shame on you.  I now have 10lbs of junk
Lot of pumpkin seeds in this box of 4 packages. Fresh quality product & 24 oz packages made this box a good investment & easy to share with friends & family! Far less expensive than buying these seeds at the grocery store!
"I ordered two-60 count boxes for the candy table at my daughter's wedding, knowing that these would be the ultimate! When we opened the box, the truffles were puckered, and chocolate was inside of the ends of the wrappers.  Some so badly (about 27-28), that I could not put them into the candy jar to take to the venue. The rest were still puckered with indentations on them. But I tried to pick the least worst ones. I opened some up to see how they taste because of the bad quality of them, in wrapped form. They did taste amazing as usual. What an embarrassment at a $30,000 plus venue. I sent an email to Sue""s Shirt Shop and More (seller through Amazon). They informed me that they were perfect at time of shipment, but wanted the order number. On October 3, I provided them the info and told them they were by far not perfect when received, that I did not have them in any heat (that I was home at time of delivery) and wondered how could they tell me they were in perfect condition at time of shipment unless they themselves physically inspected each one. As of this date, I have not heard back. I do know that we paid $10.98 for shipping and handling and would think that USPS was not responsible for their condition; however, only Amazon.com would know that. The issue of shipping never came up. But in the end, the customer (us) got the shaft. For the price we paid, we could have bought each piece individually in a local shop. Unfortunately, we did not know this would happen. I would never order these again, online. We did it because it was the only way to buy boxes of them.  omg, I have now first read other reviews and find that ours, too, did not have the shiny, crisp covering that they normally have. And, yes, there were chocolate stains on the inside of the box they came in. Just like in other orders. I now see that I am not alone in having the problems of quality being far under par. I just wish mine would have been of the correct quality so that it didn't leave a bad impression on the candy table at our daughter's wedding, which was otherwise elegant. Then again, hopefully, it reflected on the quality of Lindor truffles themselves. All I know is that someone should be very concerned. I feel like these were the rejects of their product. And, they probably were..."
I discovered this tea at a bed and breakfast.  Been drinking it ever since. Love it. Can't find it where I live so Amazon fills my needs.
"This popcorn is distinctly different tasting from the Country Time, and not in a good way! My initial thought was that it was ""stale""  though in date, and both of us (hubby and self) got an upset stomach from eating it, like you do at the movies if you add their ""butter"". I would return this if I could I've had it since July, and just opened the pack last night) and would not recommend it, at least not for the big home popcorn machines. AND, has a higher calorie count and fat count than the Countrytime, too! (Sort of explains the upset stomach, I guess!)"
"Just a heads up about this shirt. It has a nice color and nice feel to it, however when I put deodorant on it left a huge stain. That is not suppose to happen, also I washed it and had shout on it for a while and it still didn't come out & the shirt shrunk tremendouly. Would not recommend."
"These Oat Chocolate chip coconut bars are delicious - they are very soft, with a slight crunch and have a good chocolate and oatmeal flavor. I barely taste any coconut though - just a hint.  I would say that you would not even know you are eating a gluten-free, non-dairy snack! they are are great substitute for oatmeal-chocolate chip cookies anyday (if you like soft cookies).  This is a great snack to put in the lunch bag, backpack, briefcase and purse just to have something in the middle of the day to keep you going or enjoy a little snack break!<br /><br />Here are some of the facts:<br />Calories: 180<br />total fat: 9g(zero trans fat)<br />Carbs: 23g<br />Fiber: 2g<br />Sugar: 8g<br />Protein: 2g"
A lot of tea for the price... ...no sweetener needed... The product works better than I expected it to. I also didn't realize how much I was ordering. I am enjoying this product. Has very good taste.
"This past Christmas, I stumbled upon a can of David Rio Organic Masala Chai in Marshall's. It was only $5 so I figured I would try it. When I did, wow, it was amazing! The best chai I've ever had. I looked all over for other cans but couldn't find any. I eventually it at William and Sonoma but it was $10 more and tasted slightly different; less sweet. Anyway, I decided to order the Tiger Spice thinking it would be just as good. I WAS WRONG! It was horrible! It tasted like it had an artificial sweetener in it (my opinion). The texture of the powder was also different from previous David Rio teas I had purchased. Unlike previous teas that had a sugary crystal like texture, this one was very powdery; a fine powder.<br /><br />I will try my luck with some of the other David Rio products but definitely not the Tiger Spice Chai. I know a lot of people rave about it but it just didn't agree with me :("
"I don't know why this seller is selling this at $7.99, when in harney.com it is being sold at $4.00.  I happened to double check with the original website.  I almost ordered this from this seller through Amazon.<br /><br />This tea from Harney is 5 star, but this seller is 1 star."
I meant to order the liquid concentrate but these powder packets are great! I'll be using them at the office where all I need is water to make a perfect tasting Chai Latte!
My son loves this and I feel better giving him whole wheat pasta than the traditional one.
"Love these kcups. Box said ""80"" but contained only 35. Please send me the missing 45 kcups Newmans Own Special."
"Background:  I am a big fan of Trader Joe's coffee.  We have a Bunn Coffee Maker with the slow sprayhead and a Capresso Burr Grinder.  So, I guess you could say that my husband and I really like our coffee.  I usually use a combo of The Joe's coffee at TJ's and the decaf Columbian.  I do make it strong--I just realized how strong when I googled it a moment ago.<br /><br />This Coffee:  I used 1 Tbsp per 5-7 oz. cup.  I couldn't find the directions on the package as some people did--it must have been in small print.  It was like mud.  Way too strong.  Even so, I didn't like the flavor of the coffee.  It reminded me a lot of store bought Maxwell House or Diner coffee.  It had a bit of a burnt aftertaste to it for me.<br /><br />So, for me, I'm going to stick with Trader Joe's coffee."
Delicious taste---just like a chocolate covered cherry.  I especially like it added to coffee. Will give as gifts this year!
"The pretzels are tasty and convenient, but I can't give them a higher rating due to the extreme jump in price (nearly double the price it was a couple of weeks ago when I made the purchase-around $17). Due to this, I assume the previous great reviews are based on the former price. Now I can pick these up at my local Grocery for close to the same price per bag, which defeats the purchase of buying in bulk online."
"I can't get enough of this tea.  It fills my go-mug every morning on the way to work, and warms me in those early winter meetings.<br /><br />This is a great alternative for people who can't drink camellia-based tea (green, black, white, conventional or decaf) or want a caffeine-free alternative.  It lacks the sharp bite of oxidized rooibos, but still has its fruity tones.  It's not so exotic that you'd get sick of it quickly; it's not so unremarkable that you don't care if you finish your mug.  It's just right."
"Forget Starbucks, Peets or anything else. This is the real deal. Like a good vintage wine, Britt coffee is truly gourmet with no after taste! I am really fussy about coffee, and generally avoid it, but after a trip to Costa Rica fell in love with the beverage again! You have to use a French Press to get the full favor so throw away those other coffee making contraptions, your beans deserve the best, your taste buds deserve the best too. No I don't work for Britt and did not get paid to say this!!!!!  But if you guys at Britt read this send me a sample or two!!"
"I was pleasantly surprised by the stronger than I expected ginger flavor in this product.  It is excellent, if you like ginger, try this.  Best on hot biscuits!  Update.  I've just reordered, wish they sold it by the gallon, its different, something you can't find locally and excellent."
We fed our youngest all three of the HappyBellies - starting with the Brown Rice then MultiGrain and ended with the Oatmeal which I think was her favorite. I love the DHA & probiotics. And that it is organic - which no one else made. This cereal is great because you add your own liquid - she liked apple juice with it - and we didn't even heat it up. She liked it cold. As she got older I would mash up some bananas it in too.
"These chips taste average and they are insanely expensive compare to the big bags of chips from safeway or costco, for $2, you can get a big bag with 10 times the amount of chips compare to these 0.8oz bag chips, so for $5 in safeway, you can get $30 worth of popchips, these bags are so tiny, it's like serve size for fat people trying to lose weigh or something, for me, i never gain weigh, i rather go buy big bag of chips, these are expensive ripoff chips, will never buy again.<br />Maybe i think the price is high because i bought it from amazon.com, maybe elsewhere is cheaper, but chips as junk food, shouldn't be that expensive compare to local stores."
I have to give it to the makers of this line of organic baby food. This stuff is obviously high quality. It smells very fishy even though salmon is not one of the first listed ingredients. Again I was surprised but my little guy wolfed it down repeatedly. I was happy to find an organic fish food for my baby. Thumbs up.
"I rarely post a product review, but I feel that I would be irresponsible as a consumer if I did not comment on the Tanzania Peaberry whole coffee beans. I had high hopes when purchasing this coffee and I did my best to tolerate them. To illustrate, I have consumed almost one whole bag of the three, but will have to dump the other two in the trash! The beans are stale, dry, over-roasted, with little flavor. Even loading up the coffee with sugar does not seem to help! I resolved that this morning would be my last cup! I will have to resort to buying the Eight O'Clock brand at my local grocery store. I even briefly considered giving the two unopened bags to a friend, but decided that it wasn't worth alienating him! Coffee Bean Direct, you need to do better, MUCH better..."
The sweet Maui onion tastes like sour cream and onion.  I was hoping to get the delicious chips that I enjoyed in Maui.  Don't wast your time.
The people who make this have no taste buds. This does not taste like berry flavored anything. Nor any actual berries I have ever eaten. It tastes horrible. I have had some other flavors and they are fine. But this one is pretty bad. No one I have give none too (likes the taste of it either.
"Finally! The perfect snack for my little one! My two year old absolutely LOVES these! He's constantly asking for ""bueberries!"" I used to give him concentrated gummy fruit snacks for a treat, but now he only wants Little Ducks snacks. This of course thrills me! The snacks are 100% certified organic, healthy fruit - just freeze dried. I'm happy to give him as many fruit servings as he wants. You definitely will love this product! The other flavors are great too..."
"The price of this has been fluctuating forever on amazon. This listing is the same one that different sellers will use. Some are better than others but the reviews stay with the product regardless of who is selling it at the moment. Until it becomes available as a frustration free 50 count box from amazon this is what we will have to deal with. There is another seller that offers free shipping on the 108 count box every once and a while and its free shipping for everyone not only amazon prime members. when you see it available do not hesitate on getting it. It goes fast because of the free shipping. It is still a little high at about 57 cents per cup but 43 is the lowest I have ever seen.<br /><br />This is our favorite everyday coffee. It is what we call ""normal"" coffee. It's not mild or bold or flavored its just a great medium body cup of joe.<br /><br />When you register your brewer with Keurig. You will be offered some free coffee. I would suggest you get this as your free coffee. You will also be offered free shipping with that order. So buy a lot of the 5 pack samplers and get the most out of the free shipping."
"We eat pumpkin on a regular basis and it gets hard this time of year when all of the stores are sold out.<br /><br />I saw reviews here on Amazon saying the cans were dented, but saw that someone from the manufacturer had responded so I figured the problem had been addressed.<br /><br />NOT SO.  I received a case of these cans and it was wrapped extremely well - bubble wrap all over the place.  However, the cans INSIDE the case were dented and damaged - I don't mean a little dented, I mean several of the cans had their entire sides caved in in such a way that I could not open one can and on another can I couldn't remove all the pumpkin because the can was smashed so badly.<br /><br />Those most damaged cans were packaged in the middle of the case - seemingly intentionally disguising how badly damaged they were.  The cans on the outside were relatively OK, ALL of them were dented a little - every single can - but the ones on the outside were MUCH less damaged than the ones on the inside.<br /><br />I don't see how this could have been accidental, although anything is possible.<br /><br />The quality of the pumpkin itself was good, but I don't like using damaged cans in case the food inside has been compromised."
"What am I missing?<br /><br />This mix creates a pretty much tasteless pancake. I've tried adding vanilla and cinnamon. I use real maple syrup on top. I cook them in fresh bacon grease. The pancakes are still, just, blah. It's like they absorb and negate the flavors.<br /><br />The pancakes cook ok. The texture is fine. Just absolutely no flavor.<br /><br />Won't get this again. Considering pitching the rest of what I have."
"Our cat is 6-years-old and has eaten (voraciously) the same brand of food in both the chow and the canned variety for all of his life.  He's not at all a picky eater (even given to nabbing a potato chip if he can).<br /> Nonetheless, we were a bit reluctant to try a new brand of food but no worries there.  With his first can of the Petit Cuisine Chicken Pie we knew we'd found a winner.  He didn't hesitate for a second, not even the unfamiliar smell slowed him down.  He seemed to particularly enjoy the liquid, lapping every bit of it.  A full tummy, a grateful rub of my shin,  and he slept for a few hours.  What a life!<br /> Five purrs for Petite Cuisine!"
"I usually drink French Roast, either Peet's or the Costco variety. This coffee had a distinctive burnt taste, much more pronounced than Peet's. It is drikable, but certainly not in the same league. Will not return, but will only use in latte's, where the taste is mitigated by the milk"
"Switch Kiwi Berry is quite delicious, the flavor is very enjoyable.<br /><br />The only complaint I would have with this product is the addition of ""natural flavors"" which unfortunately is a very misleading term and can be very unhealthy substances but we don't know what they might be hidden under this generic term the government allows manufacturers to use.<br /><br />Still, from the ingredient list, this appears to be far healthier than almost all carbonated drinks currently being sold."
"This product is excellent. At my local store, they struggle to keep enough on the shelves. It is usually priced at $4.99 for 4 bottles, which is expensive as it is. I would try not to spend more than this."
I made the waffles and was not impressed.<br />Definitely not worth the expense!<br /><br />It's only redeeming quality was that I seasoned it to bread oven fried pork chops.<br />I would rather have saved my money and made up a flour mix from scratch.
I just followed the directions on the package and had wonderful bread. It also makes great pizza dough. I can't wait to try the other recipes.
"Have had other brands like this before, and have always enjoyed them.  These were a really good bargain on sale."
Never had jerky before because I've never seen a Halal version. Was a little apprehensive at first but found it highly addictive. Went through a whole bag in one sitting. I recommend all my curious Muslim brothers and sisters to try it.
"Even though these are pricey, my old Aussie Shep loves them. I am glad there is a special senior formula. Thanks Greenies!"
"I got this for work, as I am a cook. Everyone noticed that I have had a change in the flavors of my food. They said it was a good change. Personally I have enjoyed useing the salt in different foods. I do like it very much."
Our Baby loves it. And Amazon is very reliable and fast free super saver shipping is always a good deal. Thanks amazon.
"I am not a foodie, but I do like to eat.  Some would say that I love to eat.<br /><br />The basics: Each packet contains regular microwave popcorn and an envelope of cheese powder to be sprinkled over the popcorn.<br /><br />Flavor:  The cheese flavor doesn't taste like any cheese that I'd like to eat, if it tastes like cheese at all.  I can't quite place the flavor, but white cheddar?  Not at all.  If real cheese tasted anywhere near this bad, I wouldn't need to go to the gym.  Even people that eat blue cheese would stay away from this stuff.<br />I bought a single package from my grocer thinking: Hey it is only $1.19.  What could I lose?  Well I lost $1.19 plus tax!<br />Flavor is a complete bust.<br /><br />Popcorn:  Nice and fluffy.  If I hadn't sprinkled the mystery powder over all of the popcorn, I would have enjoyed snacking on the plain popped corn. But nooo, in my enthusiasm to finally free myself from the grips of my local gourmet popcorn dealer, I sprinkled the pack of powder on all of the popcorn.  But I digress...  I counted 31 total un-popped or partially popped kernels.  The popcorn would have been awesome if not for the `cheese powder'.  (Of course, your results may vary according to your microwave oven and superior button pushing abilities.)<br /><br />No stars for flavor<br />Five stars for popcorn.<br />Overall: One star. There is no need to pay an upcharge for powder that will render your popcorn inedible."
"I went on a search for Japanese Black Sugar (from Okinawa) after my local Japanese Markets all stopped carrying it. I was introduced to black sugar while living with a girl from Kyoto for 3 years. She preferred using black sugar because she believed it was rich in minerals (I cannot confirm or verify this), but I came to prefer it in my coffee. bigtime. The taste is quite unlike other sugar.. with a strong molasses taste. the blocks are often darker on the outside, however, the taste is unmistakable, and this is quite definitely Black Sugar.<br />I am a bit of a coffee connoisseur, and I prefer to drink my coffee with real japanese black sugar or ""Kuro Sato"".<br />When I last ordered this product, it qualified for Free Super Saver shipping, which made it a good deal. Now the only shipping option available costs $10, which probably means that I'm going back to the local Japanese market, as they've started to re-stock the granulated variety. If the shipping were a little more affordable I would favor this, as the price is decent, and the product is top notch.<br /><br />that's my two cents anyways.<br />thanks!"
"While I certainly prefer a fresh-roasted whole-bean coffee, burr-ground, and seasoned before brewing, I am inclined to drink a cup of coffee no matter the source or preparation.  My general preference runs to darker roasts, taken black.  I prepared the Puroast in a Technivorm Moccamaster, though I did back down to a bit less than the full three ounces against 10 cups of filtered water.<br /><br />The result was disappointing.  The brew was strong enough, and certainly presented a low-acidity.  That said, the flavor is fairly flat, with almost a chemical or plastic undertone.  There is no complexity to the brew, where even a run-of-the-mill Folgers offers some flavor signature.<br /><br />For someone who cannot tolerate the acid in a typical cup, it is coffee.  For anyone else, there are better-tasting alternatives for less money."
"The packaging was okay on the Easter eggs but they were all melted and the chocolate was white, very grose! We couldn't even eat them we had to throw them away. It would have been the same as throwing the money in the trash."
"I have severe diet restrictions.  All you who would like to be thin, I can recommend the IBS diet--as little fat as possible (I find I can take no more than 5 grams of fat in a meal), no dairy, no nuts, no chocolate, no caffeine, no decaf, limit wheat flour, no red meat, no heavy meals, no empty stomach, and on and on.  Deviate from the diet restrictions and you will lose weight. Eat carefully and you still lose weight.<br /><br />This allows very few options when you eat out or you're on the road.  Since I work a job which requires a fair amount of travel in a large rural area, finding a 'nutrition bar' or snack food I can eat was a challenge.<br /><br />Cliff bars are easy to find in most Walmarts, and cost just under a dollar each.  They're a little cheaper in case lots -- $5 for a box of 6.  I can only eat 2 kinds, and of course they're popular, so I seldom find them in boxes.  I searched online and was surprised to see Walmart.com offers an assortment of 3 boxes (18 bars) for $15.  They add $1.47 for shipping, but even so, that's a much better price than Amazon's offering here. If you like these, or have a lot of kids and family who do, you may want to check out that source."
"I love, love this green tea.  It is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and I usually don't get as many boxes as I did with this merchant.  I will definitely order from this seller again!! Thanks!!  I depend on my green tea fix everyday!"
The Cheddar Popchips are my favorite flavor. They are addictive. Glad they are a healthy option. We always have a case on hand of one or more flavors.
"I bought this product on a whim (I don't remember where) and fell in love with it. It is absolutely the best balsamic vinegar I've ever had. I use it on salads, vegetables, as a dipping sauce with olive oil, just about anything you can think of. It has a thicker consistency that most other balsamics and a very unique taste. With the closing of  Tavern on the Green, I was worried I would not be able to find it. Now that I've found it, I plan to order more!"
This is some of the very best raw goat's milk cheese on the market.  It has a mild cheddar flavor which is different from the often very strong taste of other goat cheeses.  This mildness makes it very suitable for cooking and baking as well.  I definitely recommend it.  It is tasty and since it is made of raw milk it is very healthy too.
"This is a good drink, tastes like soda, but fruity.  I really liked it, nice alternative to soda."
"I finally found a source for gum balls to load into my old penny gum ball machine.  now it is more than just a twenty pound curiosity sitting on my desk.  at a penny a shot, though, it surely won't make me rich!!!"
"This is my favorite k cup, and I've tried alot of them!  Love the smoky flavorl  I recommend you buy it straight from Keruig, as a member (which is free) you can get a box of 24 for 17.24.  I always order 3 boxes at a time and get free shipping.  Also like the Italian roast, but is a bit stronger and, I think, harsher flavor.  Where ever you end up buying Prima French Roast, you'll come back for more!"
"this was terrible coffee Wolfgang Pucks Jamaicamecrazy, I received a partial refund but felt I should have gotten a full refund as I can't drink the coffee and had to throw it all away. Also had to pay shipping and should not of had to. I would like a response to this."
"Could only find at local Shell gas station......now I have a source to buy all I want!  Fast & secure delivery....price is great!  Will order again, and again, etc.,....."
"I am so happy I found this product! Charlie can break through almost any toy but not this one. I was very surprised by how thick the ""jug"" is (I purchased the large.) He loves chewing on the rope which is rubber and so far it has not been broken. The dry food I put inside comes out in the right amount, it doesn't fall out like some toys and it is not to difficult like others. I am very very happy and recommend this toy to anyone with a dog that likes to chew and needs to be kept busy."
So much better than other protein products in drugstores or even GNC. Taste great and doesn't fill up like other shakes do so you can work out after quickly. Relatively cheap for all the good things you get with it.
"I placed an order for Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Beef Liver on 6/25/12.  On July 5 when my current supply was used up, I opened the new batch.  Started with one pouch and then a second pouch.  For the first time the product doesn't appear to be healthy and fresh.  Instead of being solid brown, hard and crispy, the beef liver pieces are soft, pliable and some have a whitish powdery covering on them.  I'm afraid to feed these to  my dogs or other dogs that I meet in the park.  I've been buying this product for years and this is the first time it doesn't look and feel right.  I'm going to try to get an exchange hoping that this is just a bad batch.  One thing I did notice when the package arrived and that is the long, tall plastic bag was substituted with a horizontal short bag that didn't fit the 6 pouches very well.  My guess is that another manufacturer is making this dog treat, not the original one and that's the reason for the inferior and unhealthy quality of the treats."
"When one purchases a product that is called Newman's Organics, one would expect organic food.  Not just the vegetables, which are much less expensive to be organic than the meat or chicken.  I was very, very disappointed to find out that the chicken is not organic.  For a couple of dollars more, just buy real organic dog food. This dog food isn't exactly cheap, so you expect that they will provide what they are advertising.  This whole ""greenwashing"" thing needs to be regulated better.  If someone uses the word organic in their description, it better be organic.  Otherwise the consumer is being deceived which is unfortunate.  Newmans has a great reputation, I buy a lot of their products, but this was intentionally deceptive and it makes me reconsider buying anything from them in the future.<br /><br />On the positive side, my dog loved it, she would lick the bowl around the room for 20 minutes after the last morsel was consumed.  I have no idea what they put in it that tasted so good, it's like the crack cocaine of dog food.  She has never been a finicky eater, she'll pretty much eat anything voraciously, but this stuff really rocked her epicurean world.  Too bad she isn't getting any more of it."
"My husband and I were excited to try them. We bought pineapple, beer, lemon, lime, hot peppers, cheese and wine. The only thing we noticed any difference in was the lemon and lime. The lemon was pretty easy to eat because it added some sweetness - it remained quite sour though. We each let one tablet dissolve on our tongue as directed so not sure what the problem was."
She liked the food a little at first but didn't want much to do with it... The price is very high and not worth it if she'll only eat a couple of bites. She had tried most of the flavors and would always have the same reaction.
Bought a small SmartBones chicken dog chew for our mini dachshund this afternoon from the pet store and just discovered that this product is made in China!!  NO THANKS!
"Wow, I remember when I ordered this back in January, the order came to my doorstep the next day!! I was so surprised! My boyfriend and I love this tea to death. It has a smooth, sweet taste to it and its fragrance is beautiful. This makes a wonderful, refreshing iced tea that's perfect for hanging out on sunny afternoons. It's a shame that it's a bit pricey both in cost and shipping."
If you like salt and vinegar chips but want to avoid carbs then pork rinds are for you especially this brand. I'll eat these instead of chips any day!
"I ordered this plant for my seven year old daughter.  She was extremely excited to get it so I even ordered the express 1 day shipping, which I paid over ten dollars for, and it still took over a week to reach my house.  Once it got to my house, I opened the box expecting it to be a fully established plant, which would look similar to the picture shown.  This is not the case.  It came as a pot, a bag of soil, and a damp paper towel with a VERY small plant inside...maybe 1 inch long.  There were absolutely no care or planting instructions or anything like that at all.  We were pretty disappointed.  However, I was able to plant what was there in the dirt and it seems to have survived and looks a bit better now.  My daughter is happy with this plant now, but it was a rough start."
"The expiration date says Oct 2013, but smells like rancid oil upon opening.  This is the SECOND container I have purchased from two different stores (the first one ALSO smelled horrible and I threw it out).  This tells me if it is a bad batch, it must be a HUGE bad batch.  I am going to look for another cereal for my baby."
very easy to use not the best flavor It has too much sugar and is not a quality I thought I was getting
"I had bought this product last year my dog loved them, but... I subscribe to a couple of Bichon Frise newsgroup and they are saying not to feed these to your dog as they come from China I threw out what I had left for the outside critters in the forest.  I called Dogswell today and they verified that even though they say U.S. on them they are still coming from China."
"When I saw the add, I knew I wanted to try it.  I already have a mixed selection of the Bacon Salt.  Good flavor, what I expected...but don't overdue it and it is better. Great on fries and mix it with a little lite mayo or sour cream for a salad dressing or dip.  I will accept that it isn't as creamy as mayo, and it has a kinda lite,gritty texture almost,if you taste it by itself.  Try it with peanut butter on toast.  My problem is my brother, he uses mayo on everything and he loves it, so I hide a jar just for myself.  It does have a pretty strong smokey bacon flavor by itself."
"I so wish I would have read this review before purchasing TWO gallons of this oil for my health issues. It reeks like a chemical rubber smell. This smell is coming from the black rubber gasket in the lid. When I called to report the situation to the company, Sabrina told me I would have to pay to send them a sample to have tested by a lab. Unbelievable. Good customer service would indicate that they would pay for the product to be returned and give me a full refund, including shipping. The product is faulty. Period. I will never order anything from this company again and do not recommend it to anyone based on this horrible customer service and lack of responsibility and ownership."
"Amazon sends you TWELVE boxes of these fabulous cookies and each box disappears FAST - in fact, DO NOT sit down with the whole box nearby or you will munch thru all of them without stopping! They are delicately sweet, crunchy, and buttery - without being at all greasy. You've been warned!"
"This would be a good product for camping, rafting, or hiking trips where you need to save weight."
"Oh my gosh, these are gross. I bought them because of Hungry Girl's glowing recommendation...and I gotta say, she steered me wrong this time. These are SUPER salty, and they taste like what I imagine dog kibbles would taste like."
i bought these after having them at starbucks and i loved them. im always looking for a weight watcher friendly snack and these fit the bill. they are four weight watcher plus points and are delicious.
"i was a bit hesitant at first to order this, due to many reviewers that complained of dented cans, but figured i'd give it a shot anyways. the package arrived in perfect condition, not a single dent on any can."
"McVities make a great product. Unfortunately the shipping still leaves much to be desired, though it has improved somewhat. In order to protect the biscuits bubble wrap has to completly wrap the product. Simply putting it across the top doesn't protect the bottom and sides and you end up with a case of broken pieces! it is very frustrating as this does seem to be the least expensive way to buy them (short of going to England where you can get them for about 70 cents for a 14 oz pkg.)"
"It is a shame WHEN YOU ADD SUGAR AS A PRIMARY INGREDIENT IN THE FIRST 5 ITEMS! Being allergic to gluten, doesn't mean a person is NOT ADDICTED TO SUGAR! Sugar is the number one substance that manufacturers LOAD UP ON and place in the top ingredients when they omit so-called allergies, like gluten. I AM SICK AND TIRED OF NOT BEING ABLE TO HAVE WHEAT FREE GOODS and being forced to take in sugar. I AM ADDICTED TO SUGAR, AS WELL ARE MILLIONS OF US! stop replacing what could be valuable gluten free foods with sugar------ AND SUGAR IS KNOWN BY OTHER NAMES and is the same:; maltodextrin, sucrose, sucralose, dextrose, dextrin, ORGANIC SUGAR (that's a joke, sugar is sugar!)"
"A bit pricy, but well worth it to avoid the garbage found in other gums.  Made in USA and delicious."
"I love this salt!<br /><br />And for the reviewers concerned about it not melting quickly... it's not supposed to. It's a FINISHING salt. It's a complete waste to cook with it, plus it's hard to come up with equivalent measures if you were to use it when cooking in place of kosher or table salt.  But sprinkled on a rib eye fresh off the grill, on a pan seared salmon filet just before you serve it, on roasted aspargus right out of the oven, or even over a fresh, crisp apple half - it's ""Na"" heaven! If you already use finishing salts, you know what difference they can make. And if you're not, it's an easy way to take your dishes to the next level. Bon appetite!"
My dog loves this toy! He gets so ecited he rips the top right off! Too funny! Highly recommend this toy
"Not only was this tea a good bargain, and good tea.<br /><br />But because it's sold in bulk, in recyclable metal containers, it has a much smaller environmental/manufacturing footprint than tea sold in tea bags.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />It also makes a great gift for the tea lovers in your life."
"OK- I have to admit I was a huge SB fan (you know, that big StellarMoney coffee chain on every corner). I didn't expect much from a coffee ordered online, but I take any thoughts back after the first sip of this smooth, rich coffee. There is none of the gritty, acidic after taste of other coffees; but instead a blooming, silky flavor of nuts, mocha, and pure coffee. Mind you, this isn't a flavored coffee, it has all of these nuances built into the Riviera Sunset Decaf blend. Oh- did I forget to mention it's decaf? I couldn't believe it myself when I looked at the bag the second day! I thought it was true, caffinated coffee by the flavor alone, though I did notice the lack of energizing (as would any decaf). Highly recommended... and I am switching!"
"Bought one of these from a pet store for my dog. I always try to give her natural minimally-processed chews and treats, she goes through a lot of bully sticks, pig ears, & himalayan chews.  The label didn't say what this was made of & I thought it was a bully stick or other bit of dried bull anatomy like a large tendon. Nice that it's odor-free but the texture seemed unusual, it's sort of soft & chewy like a heavy dried dough, not tough & durable like a normal bully stick.  My 20lb bicha-poo ate the whole 12"" stick in about a half an hour. After looking it up online I discovered that it's not natural meat at all but a man-made ""fake"" bully stick.  Ingredients: Potato starch, meat by product, corn starch, sorbitol, liver, cellulose, water, egg, lecithin, calcium stearate, titanium dioxide, caramel color, sorbic acid.  I won't be buying these again: Full of weird ingredients, not natural, and it does not last."
I get a case every 6 month. Very good soup & since I'm on a low salt diet I add some italian seasening.
"I found Wild Thymes many years ago and have continued to use their products - the Lemon Salad Refresher is my favorite salad dressing, it is light, now cal, and very tasty. Excellent on any green or pasta salad and especially good on fresh Heirloom tomatoes with fresh avocado slices. Yum! Their Customer Service is excellent and helpful, and the site shares some great recipes as well. I'm a fan."
i love popchips and this was really a treat to get the variety of flavors and the individual bags were such convenience! Thank you!
I found these at a local pet store and couldn't locate them again.  Great price and dogs love them.  I rec'd my shipment quickly with no problems.
"I bought this a few years ago and really liked it.  They must have changed the recipe because this just tasted odd, sort of medicinal."
"These little cups are a waste of money. The Kerug machine had a difficult time processing the coffee through the cup, and as a result I ended up with several half cups of coffee.<br /><br />I tried it about 10 times, and then gave up."
"I wa hesitant about ordering this product simply because I never ordered snacks of the internet,  so after finally decided to order it. It arrived within 3 days! the flavor is awesome! just like what I hoped for! if you like health food or like potato chips but hate thinking about how oily they are after eating them then this product is for you! if you are happy with the regular potato chips and doesn't care about the the oil and calories then stay where you are! those chips have so much flavor! they kinda remind me of rice crackers but with flavor! I have lived in the U.K. for a while and one thing I have always missed is the crisps that I used to eat in U.K. those popchips reminded me of the taste of the crisps! I will be order those again!"
I like Kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked.  I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly. So I don't know why these were different.<br />Will never buy these chips from here again.
This is by far the best K-cup coffee I have tasted. Has a big bold taste with lots of flavor. Unfortunately the price is too high so will only buy on special occasions.
This is a really good spread! The blended nutty flavor really hits the spot. I don't just spread it on my slices of bread but made cake rolls with it! making it tasted yummier!
I have tried a lot of decaf coffee and this has the best taste of any.  It is so good that I believe I could give up the regular coffee.  Amazon offers it with free shipping and the convenience is great.
Patak's makes the best curry around. I frequently use it in my Yellow Chicken Curry Dish which is a favorite with both my husband and seven year old.
"#1  The shipping is more than the item.<br /><br />#2  I just received this ""orgeat"".  Orgeat is an almond infused sugar syrup.  The Fee Brother's ""Orgeat"" is corn syrup, artificial flavors and preservatives.  Not surprisingly, it had a bland flavor.<br /><br />#3  Good cocktails are made from good mixers.  This is not a good mixer."
"I bought this honey substitute and a bottle of Nature's Hollow Honey Substitue for a side-by-side comparison with Honey Tree Imitation Honey, which I have used for years. I believe this product has a slightly slimy texture and ""mouth-feel"". It also lacked the pronounced honey flavor I find in the Honey Tree. Although it does not cause the gas ""problem"" that can occur with large comsumption of Honey Tree, I believe I will stay with Honey Tree. Note: I have used Honey Tree as a base for pecan pie (instead of Karo syrup) and it was just okay. Excess gas was a definite problem as I always eat a large slice of pecan pie. I intend to make a pie with the Natrazyle. If it is better than the Honey Tree I will report back."
"I planned to make a batch of blackberry mead (honey wine)and needed a good honey for that.  I'd read reviews of this honey, and most were glowing reviews.  One was even from a fellow mead brewer.  While some reported tasting or smelling a light blackberry flavor from this, I have to say that I didn't.  It is a dark, rich honey without the ""hay taste"" of clover honey.  My wife is not a fan of honey at all, having only eaten the supermarket garbage.  Even she loved this stuff, and kept going back for more.  I have my mead brewing (6 1/2 gallons), and the brewing yeast seems to love it too.  I ordered a second 12lb bucket of this honey for my next batch of mead, which will be black cherry.  Anna's Honey is the best I have ever tasted!"
"This just did not smell or taste like real olive oil.  And the smoke point was lower than it should have been.  Perhaps it was a bad batch, diluted with some other oil, but I'll never use it again."
"I bought this product thinking it was a gold sheen as seen on the bottle being sold by amazon. It has no sheen to it at all it doesnt even say sheen,its just ""gold"""
We ordered this on our Doctor's recommendation and take a tablespoon every day as a supplement. It's supposed to have several omega acids.Also tasty on salads.
I make 3 to 4 loaves of bread each week. Pamela's Wheat Free Gluten Free Bread mix makes it soo much easier. I have never had a loaf made from Pamela's bomb. The bread is very delicious and does not need to be warmed or toasted.
"So, somehow Diamond captured the perfect flavor of french toast without all the calories. Such a great flavor, after tasting only a few for the first time I immediately orderd three more. These don't even have that ""Almond"" aftertaste, it finishes very nice with a hint of a butter maple flavor...wow.<br /><br />Now: To Diamond please rename to ""Buttery French Toast"", as this would be much better fitting."
"I LOVE green tea and green tea beverages. When I saw this on sale I was happy to try it. Once I received it and tasted it I was not so happy. First off tasted like the smell of dirty water. Best way I can describe it lol This has cane juice yet tastes like it doesn't have anything. Added calories for what no flavor? No Thanks. So yeah all in all pretty flavorless (beside the dirty water smell taste). Was a huge disappointment. Worse yet I bought 2-12 pk cases. Now I have to doctor the rest up. Maybe just buy some lemons and make them into a green tea lemonade? Oh well, I tried."
"The toy is so so. I enjoy the buster cube and atomic treat dispenser much better. The hard plastic jar against the tile floors is VERY distracting.<br /><br />The tug-a-jug kept my dog entertained just as long as the other 2 dispensers. After a while, he just gave up and would lie down next to it.<br /><br />The noise this thing made was just unbearable."
"This lemon salt is ok, but the salt is not infused with the lemon, the lemon is mixed with salt granuals.  So might as well use lemon."
These chips are a great snack if you don't want all the junk assiciated with chips.  Try them you'll like them.
This walnut oil is the best on the market. It has been roasted which enhances the walnut flavor. I love it with scrambled eggs and in preparing rice dishes. I've even used it to condition my hair! I completely trust Roland Foods because they are superior in every way.
I guess my palate is not as sophisticated as I had thought. I'm a rather adventurous diner but this truffle oil really cashed me out. I tried it on scallops and pretty near had to trash them. I have no idea what amuses people about truffle oil. I gave mine away (ananomously).
"I ordered what I thought was five ""4"" packs of Smartbones medium size. What arrived was five ""single"" packs of the Smartbones medium size. The price for a four pack was a little more than half the local store price for the same items.... But for a single bone it works out to more than double the cost. I don't know if the problem is with the web/computer system or if the packer simply grabbed the wrong items. As I couldn't find a way to contact Amazon my only choice was to return the items. I'm afraid to reorder as I can't be certain the same mistake will not reoccur. Too bad as the price would be good and my dog loves the product."
I ordered a box of the Omaha Steaks Top Sirloins and it was like eating shoe leather. Toughest meat I've ever had.  There was absolutely no flavor to the steak and I didn't want to waste it so I gave it to my dogs
"love the wolfgang puck restaurants,cookware,brand endorsed products, all his brand products / cuisine are amazing, i am a loyal fan, yet this creme caramel coffee is tasteless, no real coffee flavor, no hint of caramel or creme, it brews like a bit of steamed milk, that somewhat pasty tasteless feel on your palate. soooo dissapointed as i am such a loyal fan of all his brand, products. sadly,a waste of funds, did not return because i think food items are none refundable."
"They're almost gone already, and I'm about 5 pounds heavier, but these candy bars are much fresher than anything in the stores--if and when you can find an outlet that carries them! Yum!"
"First, let me say, I do not consider myself to be a coffee connoisseur or snob. I do not have a refined pallet. But, I do enjoy a good strong cup of coffee. The Emerils bold is exactly what I was looking for. I know there are always those out there that say, ""nowhere close to my custom grind and French press."" But, I use the keurig for the convenience and variety. The emerils bold is perfect for what I want - a good strong cup of coffee to start off my work day.<br />***********<br />Update 7/26/12<br />I've tried a couple other ""bold"" coffee's, just to compare. (Brooklyn Beanery Fugettaboutit and Jet Fuel)  Not all bolds are the same. The other bolds seemed more bitter. (Some people think that bitter = strong coffee. Not true, strong coffee = good coffee, bitter coffee = bad coffee.) I'm done experimenting with different brands. For a good, strong cup of coffee, Emeril's Big Easy Bold will be my go to coffee from now on.<br /><br />Also, I just want to make one more comment on defective K-Cups. I see alot of reviews for both Emeril's and other K-Cups saying saying that they are horrible because 1 in every 3 explode in their Keurig machine. My wife and I go through 60 - 70 K-Cups per month, since December 2011. We've never had a problem with any of them. (when I say 60 - 70, they're not all Emeril's bold - we would be bouncing off the walls. We also use Caribou breakfast blend, decaf, green tea, heral tea, and hot cocoa.)"
"For quite a while, before Amazon starting retailing food items, it was nearly impossible to locate this healthy underground-favorite brownie mix. There were blogs and food sites bemoaning how hard it was to locate.  So when we saw it on Amazon we ordered a case and baked up batches for all our friends and family. The concensus was: it tastes healthier but, never the less, quite good. It is far better when prepared with at least a cup of mini-chocolate chips. (Not regular chips which can sink to the bottom.) We buy good quality Belgian chocolate minichips. This mix is a great alternative if you want less guilt in your guilty pleasures."
This is awesome stuff. I'm a weight watcher and this is an excellent subsitute for creamy peanut butter. You can do anything with it. It has an awesome fresh peanut taste. Makes a great apple dip and really good peanut smoothie without all the fat and calories. Will for sure buy again.
"After reading about the benefits of coconut water, I decided to give this brand a try.  I have tried a few other brands with a juice added, but they all have lot of extra sodium.  Be sure to read the labels.  Some have less potassium in them than the Via Coco brand.  I felt like this was better for my husband to drink than Gatorade. He works on a/c during the summer and is out in the heat all day long."
I bought the Kuerig because I love the Dunkin Original and Green Mountain Nantucket Blend.  Rodeo Drive has now become my favorite.  It is very delicious and smooth.
"No matter how wholesome a snack may be, it's worthless unless the girls approve. In this case they both give the Science Diet Jerky Treats two paws up. I like that beef is the first ingredient in the recipe and there are none of those unrecognizable ingredients created in a science laboratory.<br /><br />The treats are a nice size and have just enough chew to satisfy. For Piper, our shih tzu with a few missing teeth, I break the treats into smaller pieces so she can manage them.<br /><br /> On the package:<br />Use within 3 weeks of opening.<br />100% satisfaction guaranteed<br />Keep this bag out of the reach of pets and children."
"I was originally turned on to this brand because of the ingredient list in the wet foods -- no more by-products! -- and vey few (if any) grains, depending on the flavor. One of my two cats will eat anything but the other is the pickiest eater and after MANY trial runs with other foods settled on <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N62EAK"">Merrick New England Boil Cat Food 5.5 oz (24 Count Case)</a> for whatever reason. What amazed me is after all that trial and error finding a food for the picky guy, one day he just started eating the surf & turf flavor I bought for the indiscriminate one. Now that he's tasted surf & turf he prefers it over everything else -- they both do. Exceptional product. Their coats look phenomenal and we haven't had an issue with UT issues since moving to Merrick wet food. The reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because the last time I ordered with White Dog Bone, the cans came a little crumpled -- nothing so bad that it had to be returned, but it wasn't preferable."
"I bought this (herbal) tea for relief from (a couple months of) breathing issues. Thinking that I may have asthma (I've never been diagnosed). At first it was grand, helping my cough, soothing to my throat and chest. Then surprisingly my stomach started to gurgle and I was frequenting the loo, stopped taking things were fine. Finally, last night I tried nettle (2 caps) and some ginger with honey added tea..ahh relief, sleep! Tonight I will try angelica root and see if that helps."
"I was really excited to try these out as salt & vinegar has always been my favorite flavor. I have to say that the taste is spot on but the texture was off-putting for me. I could get used to and somewhat liked the stale cracker feel but they left an awful coating in my mouth. It was akin to plain Smartfood popcorn. I'm guessing it has something to do with the production of popped foods. Not bad but not something I'd try again. However, the two positives are that they are significantly cheaper on Amazon by almost a $1.50 per bag and have less fat content than baked. If you're a fan, this is a great choice."
"Perhaps Arame seaweed is always bland and mealy, but I wasn't impressed when I made my first dish with this.  The recipe specifically called for arame and hijike seaweed."
I've tried pretty much every pepper covered peanut (or cashew) on the market and these are by far the best.  You'd better like spicy though.
This Tiny box of mediocre chocolates cost 20$... Not including shipping.  Not worth it.<br /> Just go with Sees or Godiva.... I wish I could return it
"I don't enjoy this blend much, but as another reviewer mentioned perhaps it needs a Melitta coffee maker for it's full potential.<br /><br />I've made 3 pots:<br /><br />First I followed the instructions (2 level teaspoons per 6 ounces). I got brown colored water.<br /><br />Then I doubled it. Tasted kind of like a cheap grocery store canned brand.<br /><br />Finally I filled a #4 filter about 1/3 full to about 9 oz of water. That produced the best results, but I still just wasn't thrilled with the flavor.<br /><br />So you know where my taste in coffee is coming from, I normally drink medium roast (which this is), so that isn't the issue. I do normally grind my own, but again pre-ground won't cause that big of a difference. My preferred daily coffee is Safeway house brand medium roast Colombian, but lately due to finances I've been drinking a dollar store brand called ""Eight O'Clock"" that's of similar (though different) quality to the Melitta.<br /><br />My suggestion is if you'd like a quality coffee in this price range look at Seattle's Best (Starbucks milder step child) or if you have a Safeway their house brand beans are quite good.<br /><br />Edit: I compared the Melitta today with a similar Millstone (Medium Roast Colombian Supremo). The Millstone was much better."
Excellent taste-with orange spicey flavor  fairly priced<br />Tea is helpful with an upset stomach and when coffee just does not hit the spot..
"The reason I'm not sure of the other reported benefits/claims is that I do not suffer from gastro issues related to coffee - other than the first cup assisting in getting things moving in the AM.  I happen to like bold, bitter, and even light coffees - all depending on my mood.<br /><br />Having siad that, this coffee is delicious even for those who don't need the claimed beenfits.  I am drinking it as I type this, and my wife is about to try her first cup.  She's more sensitive to because she has reflux and heartburn.  According to her, she couldn't notice the differences yet.  But she also reported that it was smooth and mellow, and went down very easily."
"I bought this potting mix a few months ago and about a month ago I started seeing the gnats, which have been increasing daily. My plants are indoors so I was wondering where they came from.  Yesterday I opened up the potting soil bag to repot a plant and found the inside of the bag crawling with the bugs. Maybe it was just a bad batch but I would suggest trying a different brand of potting mix to be sure."
"These noodles are not made in Thailand as the website, states, but in China! I advised Amazon of this, but they have yet to change the advertising, so buyer beware. If you prefer not to eat rice products from China, do not purchase these noodles."
"To quote another reviewer, I can't understand the high praises these chips have been receiving.<br /><br />Based on their popularity and high review score I ordered the 6-flavor variety pack off of Amazon. With some excitement I tore open the packaging and tried the various flavors. I was met with disappointment. Texture-wise, these chips are not crunchy at all and are unsatisfying. The flavors vary from terrible to passable. I couldn't finish the pack of what they call ""salt and vinegar"" chips.<br /><br />I suppose these chips might be popular with people who are trying to watch their weight.<br /><br />An anecdote: the day after I received these I gave the rest away to the other people in my dorm (who proceeded to affirm my suspicions that these chips were subpar). I then went to the corner shop across the street and bought some salt & vinegar Kettle chips."
They taste pretty good. I eat one of these with some of the poultry selections from Omaha Steaks. It makes a great meal.
"I'm a big beaba fan. After trying out the babycook machine and the beaba spoons, I decided to splurge and buy these freezer trays. I'm so glad that I did...no buyer's regret here. I love that they are made of silicone and come with its own lid. The silicone material keeps the tray flexible so that it's easier to remove the food balls (as my husband calls them). Just a few twists and turns on the tray and the food balls pop out. They're so easy to clean too, dishwasher safe. I bought 3 more of these so I have 4 trays in different colors. Looks super cute in my freezer! :)  I would DEFINITELY recommend these to my friends."
Paul Prudhomme makes great seafood seasoning and pork and veal seasoning. I found the Vegetable Seasoning to be too spicy.
"A very bitter tasting coffee even when enhanced with cream and/or honey. Definately not my cup of coffee. Oh, did i say it was bitter?"
I must say that this was a great offer.  I use my Keurig Brewer everyday and this was my favorite coffee.  I shop everyday on Amazon because of all the good deals and more important I trust Amazon that what they are selling is just as they described it.  I have bought coffee from many places but this was the best price.  Keep up the good work Amazon.  Thanks!
"Holy cow!  I have never seen this much grease in a boxed product like this!  Also, it has enough salt to kill an entire family of slugs!  Use it in your garden, don't eat it!"
"I love this water.  It is very uplifting.  I feel better drinking it.  It is arsenic free, flouride free, chromium 6 free, chlorine free,and mtbe free-something about reverse osmosis and medicinal grade oxygen really works.  At work, we are no longer allowed to drink soda in our classrooms, so I bought some Penta water. I am hooked.  I like the one liter size bottles.  I wish you would sell those also!  I was lucky to purchase this at Dorthy Lane Market!  Buy this water!"
"These treats are well liked by dogs, the right size and don't smell or feel too gross in your hands.  Not really sure what else to say about them except that if organic is important to you, then these seem to be one of the few options for dog treats out there.  I will buy them again."
"""The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs (also sold as chicken tenders, strips or treats) may be associated with illness in dogs. In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians."""
"I read all the positive reviews and thought I'd give it try. First of all it tasted stale.  Secondly I had to use 5 spoonfuls just to get any taste and then it didn't taste like the chocolate. It tasted more like Olvatine.  For the young people out there, Ovaltine was drink in the 50's, Which I didn't like any better. We all have different tastes.  For my part I won't be ordering this again.  UPDATE: I bought the Milk chocolate at the same time and decided to try that.  It was delicious.  I can't explain the difference but I'd recommend the Milk Chocolate just stay away from the one with the marshmallows."
"I can't drink plain/unflavored coconut water because of the horrid taste.  Since coconut water works so well to hydrate after a workout, or on a hot day, I am so glad I found this flavor!  I tried it after being unable to find the passion fruit flavor, which is also quite tasty.  I have tried other flavors and other brands, but this is my favorite."
We are trying to curb our carbohydrates.  The Wasa Crisp'n Light is a big help.  Especially when you need something crisp.  We have and will continue to order this product.  Thanks Amazon for selling this tasty cracker.
"My dog will happily eat Sorel boots, pens, old work gloves, and any paper product but chewed on one of these treats for a couple seconds and just left it sitting on the floor.  This is the first time I've ever given her something to eat that she didn't basically inhale.  How do you eff up making a dog treat?"
"This tea is more ginger than lemon, so if you like the taste of soothing ginger, you'd like this product. I mix two packages per 16 oz BPA-free Camelbak bottle, filled with 8 oz of water and the rest ice, and a packet of stevia. Shake well, take sip, ahhh - no-calorie sweet tea, green tea antioxidant, and great for summer. I called the Stash company to find out how much caffeine was in a packet, and the rep said ""negligible.""<br /><br />I also buy the Stash powdered mint green tea, and I prefer the hint of mint better. Again, if you are a ginger fan, you'd really enjoy this product."
"I was so excited to get this toy for my 7 month old yellow lab.  When it arrived I filled it with kibble and soon discovered that this is the worst toy ever. It is loud and dangerous. The jug is a hard plastic that when swung around can easily bruise you and your dog and break everything in the house. In addition, because I have hard wood floors, the loud bang of the hard plastic against the floor was unbearable.  Lastly, in the two days I allowed her to play with it, the rope became frayed and I kept finding pieces of string in her mouth.  I definitely do not recommend this item."
"Dr Sears knows babies, and his recommendation of this product went a long way in our decision to purchase it.  At first we were making our own rice cereal out of organic ground brown rice, but of course couldn't add the DHA and probiotics.  Our baby gets those through breastmilk, but it is nice to be able to supplement with the cereal.<br /><br />It is very easy to mix and use, and tastes good.  Much easier than making your own, and way better than any of the Gerber products.  I'd recommend any of the HappyBellies products."
"I don't usually like hot sauce because all they do is burn my mouth but I am now literally hooked on GB. I don't know what they put in it but there is so much flavor and it's so perfectly balanced that it makes pretty much everything taste better, from eggs to steak to pizza. I can't eat anything without it. The smell alone will get your juices going and you can actually taste it before it kicks, and when it does, it's pleasant and just hard enough.<br /><br />Another thing I love is that it isn't just a spicy red watery liquid as most other sauces. You can see the peppers and the spices there, all ground into a paste and it looks, feels and tastes natural and fresh.<br /><br />I urge everyone to try it. I almost wish that it was not associated with Dexter Holland so that people wouldn't think of it as some famous musician's side project (although, then it wouldn't have the most awesome packaging of any hot sauce). He quite obviously takes this seriously though and so should you. Don't dismiss it, get it and you won't regret it."
"I originally ordered this product because of a Dr. Oz episode in which a naturalist stated Ghee could be used to cure dry noses. I know it sounds funny, but its true. Before I ordered it I did not realize what Ghee actually was. Once we received are VERY TIMELY shipment of Ghee, I put it in the kitchen cabinet and waited for a first use. My husband had run out of coconut oil, which we do most of our cooking with and so he turned to the Ghee. And we haven't turned back! The flavor is amazing and it is good for you. Particularly, I really like this seller of Ghee because it is natural and grassfed. Good work!"
"This is such a delicious snack.. My kids and I LOVE them.. White Cheddar is our favorite. I went to Costco today hoping to find them again as that is where I originally purchased them.  Unfortunately, it was one of those fly by night items that is in and out too quickly..  I am planning on purchasing them thru Amazon as my girls are dying for another bag... The best part is that it is a relatively healthy snack... Two thumbs up from this mom.!!!"
I adopted a 12 yo cat from a woman who had a premature baby with a lung condition.  She's skinny and will eat very little besides Wiskas.  I think it's Soilent Green for cats.  I would never feed this to her if she would eat anything else.  I don't think she's long for this world!!
"Love, love this item.  I bought the regular and chocolate and enjoy them both.  I mix mine equal parts powder a<br />& water and it is perfect on crackers, as a dipper or just off the spoon for a quick protein rich, low fat snack.<br /><br />I have also used it in protein shakes and diped raw apple and pear slices right into the powder too!<br /><br />Yum.<br />Try it!"
"You think you're doing something good for your kid when you invest a little more to get an organic formula.  Sadly, that's not the case here.  This is a horrifically constipating formula...lots of pain and straining, guaranteed.  Having to take measures to prevent this (offering juices, water, etc) is just not a sensible approach.<br /><br />Also, the manufacturers use sucrose instead of lactose to save money, and they use a LOT of it.  With the same sweetness as country time lemonade, Similac Organic's sucrose-based formula may also set your child up for future diabetes.  Check the NY Times article for more info on this.<br /><br />Bottom line: painful constipation in the near term, possible diabetes and certainly a sweet tooth in the future...no, thanks!"
"Hubby and I both have teeth that can't handle anything too seedy or hard. I also lost 81 lbs (so far) doing a lower carb diet (not LOW, but LOWER). I pretty much skip bread these days--and cereal, etc--but I don't mind using up some of my starch/carb calories on these. So versatile. To dip. To make cracker sandwiches. To use breakfast type spreads on (when a craving for bagels/toast hits). I love them with hummus, with cheese, cracked over soup, topped with egg salad, with neufchatel and sugar-free preserves (I use Nature's Hollow). They are so nice to have with my breakfast omelettes.<br /><br />Even my super picky hubby likes them. We both adore the texture. Oh, man. How perfect. The lightness that preserves a nice, gentle crispness.<br /><br />Wasa, please don't ever stop making these.<br /><br />I like this one and the mild rye. Both are now staples here. Satisfy my bread needs without a ton of carbs. And since I restrict myself to 1200 calories, two of these do little damage to my eating plan at 20 calories each. I also like to watch my sodium (middle-aged and almost off blood pressure meds), and these don't pack on the salt.<br /><br />Thumbs up!<br /><br />Now, if they could make one that's like an everything bagel--an everything crispbread light and crispy version with the onion/garlic/sesame seed/poppyseed. How cool would that be? (Or maybe they already have, dunno.)<br /><br />Update: I don't eat gluten anymore, so I don't buy this product these days. For those who don't care about grains/gluten, I can still recommend it based on texture/taste/calories. But not for me as I'm trying to stay gluten-free. Be well..."
"I too have been ""bugged"" by black flying insects in my Miracle-Gro potting soil. I've thrown out bug-contaminated soil, and sprayed with insect killer.  I went online to see if others were having the same problem with Miracle-Gro soil, and they have.  I also wrote an email to Scott's, the company that manufactures Miracle-Gro, and am hoping to get a response (probably not, but you never know!)  In the meanwhile, I'm going to see if I can find a cleaner soil to pot my plants in."
"I have been giving my dog these treats for years, thinking I was giving her something healthy.  I took her to my vet because she has been having bladder issues.  That's when the vet told me not to give them to her because they were made in China.  She said dogs have been getting sick from eating jerky treats made in China.  I can't believe I have been poisoning my poor little dog!  I will never buy another food product from CHINA!"
"My dogs all love the Dogswell Happy Hips Chicken Chews, they can't wait to get them and know where I keep them, they go straight to the cupboard where they are stored. I love giving them these treats because not only do they love the taste and gobble them up, I feel good knowing they contain healthy ingredients that will give them stronger bones.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AJ1ULS"">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken Breast,15-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a>"
"I've used this coffee before and after trying others, I seem to go back to it.  It's just a nice cup of morning coffee and the price for this produch was very good too."
My husband didn't care for this coffee at all.  He complained it lacked flavor and aroma.
even my vet approves. these little treats are my dogs favorite. i just get the small ones because i have a small dog.
"If you have tried pumpkin seeds in the past chances are they have been heavily salted, seasoned and deprived of most nutritional value...or had the taste and consistency of styrofoam. Fortunately, neither description applies to these. They are indeed raw but removed from the hull for easy eating. No added salt or other nuisance chemicals - just delicious and nutritious snack. Mix with raisins and/or sunflower seeds for a healthy snack rich in zinc/other vital nutrition or use with breads, cereals and flavor for your favorite recipe."
"We've all loved our carbonated drinks. Some of us have gone through (or are in the midst of) real addictions to coke and diet coke. Of course these drinks have caffeine and who doesn't need caffeine. But another attractive feature that leads to addiction is carbonation. Who doesn't like that fizzy feeling?<br />So, why not take a reasonably healthy drink like 100% fruit juice and make it carbonated? Brilliant! You get the sugar rush (but healthy sugars!) and the carbonation, without the crazy ingredients of most soda drinks.<br />You'll never need a mystery-fruit-flavored high fructose corn syrup, Yellow Dye # 9 concoction again!<br />I just wish the cans were a little bigger. This is one drink that can afford to be super-sized."
The breakfast cookie is not to my liking and I do not think I will order them in the future!
"I concur 100% with the other negative reviews.  My nuts arrived rancid and were not edible.  What more is there to say other than these Azar macadamia nuts were a huge waste of good money?  Two pounds of expensive nuts were tossed out in the back yard to feed the wild life and even the squirrels would not eat them.<br /><br />I will stick with organic raw macadamias, preferably from Hawaii and a more reliable producer."
"Terrible! I cannot believe this, I received this item and EVERY SINGLE BAG WAS OPENED BUT 4!!!! I'm stationed in Afghanistan and this was gonna be a snack for my team while going out on missions. I was so embarrassed when the bags were opened and spilt out all in the box, gross! And the box is filled with grease stains. Idk if it was from the airplane ride all the way here, but the box should have been more insulated and bubble wrap should have been used instead of paper. I'm very unhappy with stale crusty chips out the bag and us soldiers cannot enjoy now."
"I had been told that Himalayan salt was much better for you.  After shopping around, I found the best deal was through Amazon.  It came in a heavy resealable bag and works great in my salt mill.  I would buy this again and recommend it to my friends."
"All the samples I received for review were of the same flavor,Dark French Roast. It tastes like a slightly bitter espresso coffee. I filtered the coffee the first time I made it, but it is better suited to an espresso maker, whether a traditional Italian one that goes on the stovetop or an electric machine.<br /><br />The coffee has a rich, strong, slightly bitter taste - it is not mild like Sanka or a decaffeinated coffee.  I would not describe the taste a smooth, but it's not incredibly rough.<br /><br />It did not irritate my throat. I was unable to test the acidity myself and when I received my review packages the vendor's website showed links to Dr Taka Shibamoto's site at UC Davis, known for its food research, who had tested the coffee. On the Puroast website the link to the research paper is missing. This concerns me.  The vendor has their own documents, with detailed analyses, on its website - which needs updating so it looks less amateur. I am not a food scientist or chemist, so cannot comment on whether the coffee has unique characteristics.<br /><br />I did visit a gourmet coffee shop that sold a wide range of coffees from all over the world who said they had encountered some less irritating coffees with low acidity.  So when Puroast claims that its coffee is lower in diCQA acid than other coffees it is being compared with well-known brands like Starbucks and Hills.<br /><br />The individual foil packaging keeps the already ground coffee fresh, tasting like coffee ground freshly from beans.  It definitely had a kick and woke me up. I drank the coffee I'd made with a packet big enough for a 10-cup carafe at 2 pm and was awake until 5:00 am.<br /><br />If you have a sore throat from drinking coffee and like drinks made with espresso coffee then this is worth trying."
Our two greyhounds love the Greenies dental chews.  I prefer to buy them the smaller treats since they are both seniors now and don't like to chew on things for extended periods of time.  The regular size fits that need.
I'm very happy with this-- drains my ears and sinuses quite effectively.  Works better for me than guaifenisen.
"The idea is great.  I am a big fan of soup so being able to make a quick hot bowl very fast is great.  The packaging could not be better.  The noodles are not dehydrated like you find in most other quick soups.  They are soft and neatly contained in a seperate bag inside the bowl.  There are also separate small bags for the liquid flavoring and dehydrated vegetables.  This is a high quality product but for my personal tastes, it was simply too bland and delicate.  I did not enjoy this soup but will definitely try the other flavors.  The Korean kimchi had much more flavor and thicker noodles."
This Great Northern brand of popcorn is very good.  It seems like more kernals pop than another brand that my family had.
"Thought these were healthy treats, but found out that they are Made in China.  Noted on back of bag.  Concerned that it may fall into China made Jerky treats suspected to cause kidney problems in pets."
"I started giving my dog this a couple of weeks ago. He really loved a different Beneful and so I gave this one a try. He LOVES it and is excited when its time to eat. (He would barely touch Purina Little Bites) I took him out of state to my mom's place and he pooped in the house 3 times! I took the blame for not paying enough attention to him. However, since we've come back home he's pooped in my apt 3 times! (in 1 week) He NEVER does that. I thought that maybe he was being spiteful, but I really think he just can't help it. The food is one hell of a laxative if thats what you're looking for. I'm glad I only bought the small bag because I WILL NOT be giving this one another try. It only gets 2 stars because he likes it and because I'm sure he would lose weight if he keeps pooping this much. TERRIBLE."
I spent $26.00 dollares for a tiny box of cookies and some 2 pc samples.<br /><br />This is the biggest rip off.
I am disappointed in these-- they taste greasy and I can't return them!<br /><br />They have 11 gm of fat and 9 gm of saturated fat!
"It cooks in microwave so fast, and it's really good right after you cook, but unfortunately it has MSG in it. Nonetheless, the fat and sodium content on this is not too bad when compared to regular pork rinds. I uploaded a photo of the nutrition facts so you can see the ingredients too."
"My son and daughter-in-law told me about these chips and they purchased a few bags at a store and I will say they are higher in stores then you can get them online on Amazon. They brought me a bag and I was hooked! So I ordered popchips online and they are the ""BEST"" chips!! There wasn't a flavor I didn't like or that my family didn't like. I am a (chipaholic) and these are better for you and a great tasting chip. I highly recommend these to anyone that can't do without eating chips either with a sandwich, hamburger, or just to munch on midday.<br />You won't be dissapointed."
"First, I readily admit this is a pricey tea, but honestly, I've come across the same quality tea in teashops that is much more expensive, and they're not organic or fair trade products.<br /><br />This Earl Grey blend is smooth and delicious! I didn't use as much as the instructions said because it was too strong/bitter for my taste buds. Using half of what they said produced a lighter, smoother tea. One note: Upon first sniff of the tea leaves, the citrus note is STRONG, but it's more balanced in the flavor of the tea.<br /><br />The packaging is nice and keeps the tea fresh.<br /><br />The size of the tea leaves is adequate. I don't end up with a lot of ""tea dust"" at the bottom of my cup. This ""tea dust"" does increase as you use the tea and get farther down in the tin (I assume this is because the smaller pieces naturally tend to settle toward the bottom of the packaging in shipment).<br /><br />Overall, a nice blend! I recommend adding a little dried lavendar blossoms to create a wonderful Lavender Earl Grey."
"When i read that these were ""long lasting"" i was hoping for a chew that would take my take more than 2 minutes for my 9 month old chocolate lab and 9 year old lab to chew. Not happy with this nylabone purchase!"
"I bought this by accident, then decided to give it a chance.  Not worth it, I would rather have less real peanut butter than eat this.  It has a gritty consistency because of the sugar and tastes too sweet and not ""pea-nutty"". It was more sugary sweet than tasting like peanut butter and the gritty texture just turned me off, maybe because it was creamy?<br />I would like to find a PB with less fat but still enjoy it, this was not it for me."
"Very dissapionted in this oder.Have had this coffee before from another source,but it wasn't avaliable at the time so I odered it thru ammazon.Not the same coffee.Very stale and weak.My hhusband and I both noticed it.Wish I had not order the 50 count but something smaller"
"Yes, these cubes are expensive; in fact, I almost gave them four stars for the expense.  Regardless, these sugar cubes are my favorite sugar product.  I've tried every brown sugar and cane sugar product you can find on Amazon and in your grocery store, and none of them compare to the rich, sweet, unique flavor of the brown sugar cubes by La Perruche.  Because I've tried so many brown sugar products, I believe the difference is the terroir, or the ground/land, where this sugar is grown.  La Perruche sugar cubes are made from African grown sugar; more specifically, sugar grown in Swaziland and/or the Congo.  Also, the cubes are denser than many sugar cubes.  I don't know from a scientific perspective how this is accomplished, but the cubes are not regularly sized, but are large and irregularly shaped, and heavier/sturdier than ""cut"" cubes by other producers.<br /><br />The flavor is a rich, distinct and more molasses-y flavor than other brown sugar cubes, and is somewhat darker as well.  I wish I could describe the flavor better, but it has been several months since I was able to find a somewhat affordable supply.  BTW, now that this product is being sold with free shipping via Amazon Prime, I just purchased several boxes - it is a much better deal as of the date of this review than it was a few months ago.  Recommended!"
"I really love this oatmeal, it is such a lovely treat. Quick and easy to prepare and delicious as an ingredient for smoothies and even in flapjacks, a must buy!!"
"I like some of Coffee Bean Direct coffees, but I cannot stand the taste of this one, and no one else in the house likes it either. I wish I could of bought it in a smaller package, rather than the 5 lb bag that cost over $30. I do not recommend this product to anyone, but everybody has their own taste, and some people may like it."
"The cake arrived askew (smooshed, like a smiley) more due to the internal packaging -- it looks like it should have been vacuum sealed.<br /><br />Overall the taste wasn't what I expected - it was kinda yucky/pasty.  The ingredients show corn syrup, which is not suitable for a rum cake glaze.  The taste is likely due to use of a starch.  It's not ""terrible"" per se, but I doubt I'd buy another.<br /><br />I think they can improve the recipe quite a bit."
"My son wanted a pitcher plant and after reading the reviews we decided to try this one. It arrived looking just like the one in the photo and now about six weeks later, it has about doubled the number of shoots growing from it. I wouldn't hesitate to order another plant from this dealer."
"Went through virtually every bold, dark coffee for my Keurig.  Emerils Big Easy Bold is the best dark coffee in the class, not in the slightest way bitter.  The pack of 50 is a great bargain,"
I received the popcorn in a timely manner. The package was in perfect condition and the popcorn tasted great.
"These are excellent!  They travel quite well and are even tastier when left in the car to chill during the winter time. They are also awesome when car travelling across the Deep South and fresh green food is hard to come by!<br /><br />Highly addictive, like crack candy!"
Our 6 month old absolutely loves this multi-grain cereal. I would recommend it to anyone and everyone!
My husband has diabetes and has been ordering these for a few years. The sugar free peach rings are difficult to find in stores in our area. They are always fresh. He orders them every six months.
"I almost hesitate to give a review because this is my ""secret ingredient"" in so many things.<br /><br />My husband is from SLO and when we first met I thought it was so weird that the only thing he wanted from his mom for birthdays and holidays was Pepper Plant Sauce (I don't do spicy so I never tried it).  Then he got some of the seasoning.  Now I understand.  We use it in and on everything - eggs, steaks, popcorn (tip - put it in the butter!), chilli, black beans, soups, cooked vegies, tuna salad, guacamole, develed eggs (my fave).  Somehow almost every time I am ""making up"" some sort of savory recipe, this stuff makes it in there.  Just 2 weeks ago I had the idea to make dip with cream cheese, sour cream, the sauce and some seasoning.  It was a total hit at the play off party.  I just made it again today for our pre-superbowl potluck at work and got rave reviews again.  Heck - while typing this up I had the thought that the seasoning would make an awsome variation to garlic bread or crostini. Mmm - I might have to try that tonight.  You have to promise not to tell anyone though!"
Puroast  Low Acid Coffee in French Roast is excellent.  It brews well and there is no loss of taste with it being low acid.  It<br />still tastes like full bodied French Roast and has a delicious smooth taste and nice color.  I have been disappointed in other low acid coffees but this met all my expectations for a full bodied cup of coffee without the acid stomach upset.
"If you enjoy Chai at the coffee shop, just buy some of this mix and make it yourself at home for a fraction of the price.  Most coffee shops I have visited actually use Oregon Chai, so you will be getting the exact same thing.  However, the liquid concentrate version is much better than the powdered form (coffee shops use the liquid version) so unless you need portable packets for work, get the liquid.<br /><br />One other thing - not too long ago I ran into a box of packets that wouldn't dissolve correctly.  I sent an email to Oregon Chai and within the SAME DAY they shipped me a whole new box!  Outstanding service from an outstanding company.  These guys really care about making you happy and they will go to any length to do so.  After that experience they have a loyal customer for life."
"This is soup. Very thin, watery and insubstantial. Will not order again. There were not even whole lentils in this ""broth."""
"I was disappointed with the taste of these chips (regular and barbecue). I can't really taste the potato, so it is almost like eating a badly-flavored foam chip. It tastes like it is stale even though it is fresh, and it also has an odd chemical-like taste. The similar baked lays and pringles chips are very tasty. My kids finally ate the rest of these chips, but only after all of the other chips were gone."
This is a great product which I have chosen to order in bulk for my daughter!
"I love Grape soda and this satisfies my craving without the guilt or worry about sugar or controversial synthetic sugars.<br /><br />In fact, I like almost all Zevia soda. Good stuff!"
"I've been giving these treats to my dog for roughly 3 weeks now.  He is a Dalmation/Hound mix and has joint issues in his back legs.  At 12 years old we have definitely noticed him slowing down.  He has food allergies so having this medication in the form of duck breast (something which dogs are rarely allergic to I am told) was perfect for our Buddy.  He's running a bit again in the yard and seems more inclined to go for a walk (something he used to love to do).  I highly recommend a try if you are skeptical.  I like it so much I went to a ""subscription"" status to save a little more money.  At roughly $20/month for us, it is well worth the ""investment"" - it just plain made him feel better!"
"I bought this product to occupy my 13-month-old mix.  She is an aggressive chewer, but the product description led me to believe that this toy was quite tough.  When I received it, I was a little disheartened when I saw that the tug was rubber, rather than rope (as it appears in the picture)- as she tends to get through rubber toys with very little effort.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I decided to try it out, she learned quickly that she could get treats out of it and it occupied her very well for almost an hour.  At that point I went to dig it out from under the bed and was dismayed to find that the rubber ""pull"" was already in pieces.  While the bottle still works and seems to keep her interested, I feel like dog toys should have a more indestructible nature than this one does.  Especially for eleven dollars!"
"Wonderful, smooth, satisfying decaf coffee with a fabulously rich flavor.  No chemical aftertaste, like many decafs I've tried.  Apparently, the Swiss Water Process used to decaffeinate this coffee leaves flavor intact, something I've found terribly disappointing in other brands.<br /><br />I've been VERY impressed by the flavor dimensions of this Riviera Sunset blend; served it to some neighbors (who simply won't touch decaf coffee) who were pleasantly surprised to find they actually enjoyed a cup of decaf.  No bitter notes; my husband, who usually complains fervently about the flavor of decaf, has been asking for a cup of this every evening, after dinner.  Believe me, this alone is QUITE an endorsement!<br /><br />I love using my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011528S0"">Zojirushi CD-WBC30 Micom Electric 3-Liter Water Boiler and Warmer, Champagne Gold</a> for coffee, tea, and cooking.  I brew my coffee a cup at a time with an individual Melitta brown paper filter <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E5E0T2"">Melitta Cone Coffee Filters, Natural Brown, No. 2, 100-Count Filters (Pack of 6)</a>and filter cone (similar to this one:<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001794Q0S"">Ready Set Joe/Mug</a>) and found that the extra fine grind of the Riviera Sunset blend imparted an unusually rich, deliciously multidimensional flavor.  Much fresher than conventional, by-the-pot coffee.  This method also allows me to brew strong coffee (for me) and a milder version for my hubby.<br /><br />Take time to ""bloom the grounds"" first (add a little hot water to the fresh coffee grounds, moistening completely, and then wait about 30 seconds before brewing) for best flavor (this goes for ANY coffee).<br /><br />Melitta's Riviera Sunset decaf blend is enthusiastically recommended by a coffee snob!  You'll love it as is, no sweeteners or creams needed to disguise this wonderful flavor.  I look forward to ordering more.<br /><br />Update 9/21/10:  Just ordered my first 3-pack through Subscribe & Save; great deal for some delicious decaf!"
"I bought this Keurig after I had coffee at my sister's house. The coffee maker I was using at home was your standard traditional one but I found that I kept wasting coffee and then the grounds would go stale. It wasn't a right fit maker for me. So, I bought this Keurig. The machine seems to take a longer time than my sister's (whose was more expensive) but it's fine. The reservoir on the left is handy because it means you don't have to fill up water every time you make a cup. I find that I need two Keurig cups for a full large mug full of coffee but I knew that going in. All in all, if you drink the occasional cup, or want a variety of flavors, I would recommend this one to you."
"Bubba loved the bone, but was a little dissapointed in the size of the bone. They must have killed some baby pigs to get femurs this small! Bone was about 4 inches long, and not very thick."
"This is one of the very finest maple syrups I have ordered and enjoyed. I bought the Fancy Grade, for the light amber color. It has a very great taste. I will reorder."
"Cracker Jacks were horrible--stale, not crunchy and tasted awful even though the expiration date on the package had not expired"
"We used to get greenies from Petco, what an amazing price difference this is!  Our beagle eats one every day and it keeps her breath in check."
"Dog: 10 month old Lab/ GSD mix who's an aggressive chewer<br /><br />Good:<br />concept<br /><br />Bad:<br />-LOUD toy, keep in mind your dog has to drop this thing to get the treats to pop out and it is made of hard plastic<br />-NOT durable. Tug insert (plastic) broke off after about a week (should have used a rope here). I may do this myself but I'm still debating if I want to hear this thing get dropped over & over & over & over again..."
This is DARN GOOD CHILI! I make this for diner when I am tired and feel like a no hassle meal. Just add some water and a small can of tomato paste and Voila! Diner is served. It's also very low on points plus if you are trying to follow the program.
"Ugh, this stuff may be good for me but it's not appealing.  I mixed it in my oatmeal for a while, and it was fine that way (but sticky).  But I didn't notice any obvious effect and I've slacked off."
"I don't eat many chips, but these I love. Great buy and arrived quick and packed great. Expiration date is a ways away, so I have awhile to enjoy them Great natural potato flavor. I love brown russet, hardy flavor and these fit that description to a tee."
"The crisp texture of these PopChips is very appealing.  The chips also stayed whole in the bag, which is a big plus.  They  have a nice sweet potato flavor, with a light hint of salt.  Best of all, no greasy fingers!  I like that they are a healthy alternative to other chips or crackers.  The information on the bag well represents the taste of the chips.  I think that children would like these and they would certainly be a healthy alternative to other chips.  They are also gluten free...which seems to be a growing trend in foods today.  Overall, I would definitively buy these chips again and look forward to trying other flavors of Popchips."
This rice has a nice taste and the whole family loves it. I would recommend to anyone who likes rice.
"Reading other reviews, I was excited to try this mix since it appeared to be Gluten free/dairy free.  Technically, the dry mix is GF/DF but the basic pancake recipe calls for eggs and milk.  Technically I can use my own egg and milk substitutes but then I could already do this with so many other mixes.  I've found that mixes that request eggs and/or milk really are better with the originals not substitutes.  The best GF/DF mixes already include a substitute so the directions only require water and/or oil or other non-dairy ingredients.  In this case, I will return to my old favorite mixes by ""The cravings place"" - these are truely targeted for a GF + DF lifestyle.  That said, if you are not DF then perhaps this is a fine choice. It would have been better to have a print/picture of the back of the package to more clearly see that this is not a great DF option."
"I usually just pan fry my pork and it always comes out a little dry and flavor lacking.  I tried these, you just cover the pork with the seasonings and put them in the oven. Hardly any work or cleanup and the pork is nice and moist and flavorful...great product."
There's an old saying that a bargain is not a bargain if there is no use for the item. While the price of this made it seem a very attractive; it goes to waste since the cats do not eat it.
"Our dog, Amber, totally loves these.  She hungrily crunched them down.  Highly recommended.  I'm sure your dog will really love them!"
I've used this product for making gomem syrup for use in cocktails.  Its fine and has produced a nice silky smooth gomme (gum) syrup for me.
"JUST GOT THIS SEASONING LAST NIGHT AND MADE SOME TURKEY TACOS WITH IT.....THEY WERE EXTREMELY NASTY.....ABSOLUTELY NO FLAVOR.....I MEAN I UNDERSTAND THAT ITS A NO SALT SEASONING BUT MAN , IT TASTED HORRIBLE AND HAS MADE ME SICK. I WILL JUST TRY A LOW SALT TACO SEASONING UNTIL I FIND A NO SALT ONE THAT IS AT LEAST BAREABLE AND DOESNT MAKE ME SICK....UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BUY THIS....."
"I'm not one to review anything on Amazon, and especially not food, but just like the others, I had to get my two cents in..don't buy this crap. To me, it wasn't flavorless at all. Infact, it was so flavorful that I had to lick my butt to get the taste out of my mouth. This garbage smells like dog food and with the way it taste it probably could pass as dog food too."
"Modeled after York Peppermint Patties, these mints are a perfect match of chocolate and sweet.  The honey filling is a bit thinner and sweeter than most mints this style, but you can tell all the ingredients are natural.  The thin layer of gooey honey complements the unsweetened chocolate beautifully.  I highly recommend this tasty treat!"
"I used this a lot for white bean / chicken chili, chicken salad, fettuccine alfredo with chicken and mushrooms.  The flavor is very good, it's low-fat, the sodium count isn't outrageous, and it works well with a lot of things.  Yes, I prefer using fresh chicken breast, but when I don't have any on hand or can't get to the store, this works very well."
"I got this coffee for my husband who loves coffee but is unable to drink it everyday due to the heartburn it gives him.  I separated the packet into 2 half pots for 2 days.  He loved the taste of it, it was bold and flavorful and did what it claimed to do...not give him heartburn.  That is a win-win in our book.  We recommend this coffee if you are looking for a bold flavor and want to avoid the heartburn."
Good thirst quencher. Milky and thicker then I expected. Not what I would call a pineapple flavor but one can get the idea it is pineapple.
"Got to hand it to them - it is a smooth cup of coffee. My sample was the Dark French Roast. Normally I do not care much for French Roast because it is over cooked in my opinion.<br /><br />I drank it black to get a good sense of the flavor. Since it is darkly roasted it doesn't have a lot of subtle tones to it like lighter roasts have. It has the twang that this level of roast imparts on coffee and, of course, a strong coffee flavor. I tend to drink my coffee a bit on the strong side anyway - a tablespoon heaped a little per ~12 oz of water.<br /><br />For the last several years I've been brewing my coffee a cup at a time with a Melitta #4 filter and a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001794Q0S"">Melitta Ready Set Joe/Mug 64010 Coffee Makers Speciality</a> (although I bought just the filter cone) and an electric kettle. If you've never tried it this method is the only way you'll get a great cup of coffee every single time. I had a liter thermos and a different filter cone and brewed it by the pot this way too. Excellent coffee every time.<br /><br />At any rate, I mention that to say this - for pre-ground coffee this is a pretty good cup of coffee. I'd be willing to bet that the Columbian roast is excellent too.<br /><br />For those of you that think 'eh coffee is coffee' I've got two words for you ... 'Chase Sanborn' Ug. Awful stuff with a chemical flavor.<br /><br />I have to say that the low acid claim seems to be exactly right. I got the sample in the mail today and just made a cup around 3:30 in the afternoon. Sort of late for me to drink coffee and on a mostly empty stomach but I don't feel like I need to drink a bunch of water to dilute the coffee.<br /><br />I like it. Give it a try. Give the Meletta cup at a time thing a try too."
I have tried many gluten free brownies  these are the best.  Good Good Good!
"EDIT:  I just noticed each bag is only 1.76 pounds, not 2.2.  My review is not 2 stars instead of three.<br /><br />First off, as you can probably guess by the pictures, these are sour gummies.  That isn't said in the description.  Also, each one is about 2 to 2 1/2 inches in length and 1/2 inch wide.<br /><br />Texture and flavor:  The came to me soft and with the same texture as most gummies such as peach rings.  The sourness is average, not overwhelming but not too little.  Where I took off the 2 stars was the flavor (most important part).  As I chewed them, a few different flavors hit my tongue, none of which tasted that great.  I couldn't make out any of them in-particular (not good at that anyways) but the combination was just plain strange.<br /><br />I could see myself getting through one bag but will probably give the other 3 away to nephews/niece.  After all, they will eat anything sugar coated right?"
"Rating 1 star due to price. Too pricey. Loved the coffee, but average price on k-cups is typically 50 to 60 cents per k-cup. Paying $1.18 per k-cup is outrageous (I thought I was getting a 2 pack for the price, my bad). Amazon has many 2 packs of k-cups for this price. Will pay closer attention on future k-cup purchases. Will not purchase this product at this price again."
"I bought this coffee because I have acid reflux/GERD.  It says it is coffee and it is low acid.  I made three pots in a very good coffeemaker and nothing I did improved the flat nothing taste of this coffee.  It also was no better for stomach irritation that other coffees I have tried.  I took a chance when I bought this coffee because it is non-returnable.  I have spent less money for much better tasting coffee.  Amazon seldoms disappoints me with the quality of their products.  Healthwise Gourmet Coffee, is something I would have been better to do without."
"This was extremely yummy.  It usually sells for an arm and a leg at the mall, so I was excited when I saw it on sale.  My coworkers are cursing my name since I have them addicted to it now also."
This was a beautiful mug set that I got for my mom and grandma to share... The day they opened it was when I first realized that this gift set only came with one mug... This was very deceptive b/c the product comes with 4 coasters... I don't understand why it only comes with one mug... The other mugs are pretty pricey to buy individually so I guess my mom and grandma will be the ones who suffered here... Thanks a lot for not using common sense and shipping FOUR mugs with your FOUR coasters...
Gluten free and sugar free white chocolate bars with 20g of protein... doesn't get any better than this.  These are my favorite out of all the flavors of Think Thin bars.  I'm on Subscribe and Save and get 2 boxes per month.<br /><br />Buying from Amazon is the cheapest way to get these bars.  I save about $5.00 per box as compared to buying them at the store.<br /><br />I have to admit the first bar I had tasted slightly chemically... I think it must be the vitamin B I'm tasting??  But now they are absolutely delicious and I crave these bars!!
"this is perfect for babies and toddlers on the go! we started using the baby version when my daughter was an infant--it is so easy to throw a pouch and a baby spoon into the diaper bag. now that my daughter is older, she is able to feed herself with the pouch. just give your toddler the pouch and they will squeeze/suck the fruit out of it. not only is the packaging great, but the fruit tastes good as well (and yes, I have tasted everything that I feed my daughter). my daughter loves this--her whole face lights up when I hand her a pouch."
"The AmeriColor AmeriMist Edible Paint and Airbrush Color Gold Sheen worked great with my airbrush or you can just spray it on. Awesome color, just as in the photos."
"If you liked flavored coffees, this one has a hint of coconut to it.  This is my favorite coffee by far. I look forward to my first cup every morning."
"After enjoying my first four Fresh Mixer varieties I had high hopes for this one as well.  Unfortunately, this one fell flat.  The sauce lacks flavor and the dish was somewhat sickening.  Having ordered a box of six, I'm not sure what I'm going to do with the others.  This one would be better off as dog food.  I do recommend the Zesty Marinara Penne, Rotini Meat Sauce and Southwestern Chicken though."
"I bought this for fathers day. My father loves dried fruits and nuts.<br /><br />It came in a somewhat cute crate box, and each compartment was in a plastic bag. That means that if you don't eat the nuts in one sitting they will go stale, as they are now sitting in the open. Same story for the fruit.<br /><br />While all the bags were closed when my father opened them he found that the nuts were stale and the fruit were hard/chewy.<br /><br />I recommend purchasing this if you need a centerpiece, but not if you actually want to eat it."
"These things are great - I discovered them at Whole Foods and now I can get them even cheaper here at Amazon with quick shipping to boot. These are great for traveling, hiking/outdoors stuff, and to bring to work for a snack. They don't need to be refrigerated, and they're vegan as well! They're made of wheat gluten, which is very high protein. I like the thai peanut flavor the best - I've tried BBQ and teriyaki and I don't like them as much."
"Just had this to make a PB&J and I was really just eating a jelly sandwich. I guess it would be ok to mix into a smoothie (maybe), but I didn't think it had any flavor at all."
"Upon opening the sealed bag, I was struck by an unpleasant scent.  Looking at the ingredients I saw, in addition to the black tea and rosebuds, a ""natural flavor"" additive.  I believe this additive is the culprit to ruining what should have been a delightful bouquet to my nose.  Then I brewed this tea, and could still taste that additive, but overall the tea was tasty.  I hope the Davidson family reads our reviews because I am certain that, if they would just refrain from adding the ""natural flavor,"" I and others would find this tea to be superb, and in keeping with the other teas I have come to enjoy from Davidson's.  For example, upon opening their Darjeeling loose tea, as well as their Assam loose tea, my nose is struck with a lovely bouquet ~ this is what one wants to experience from superb teas.  I will look forward to Davidson's responding to my (and other customer's) suggestion re: this nasty flavor additive.  I've enjoyed tea with rose petals while in India, and they did not put anything other than the tea and the dried rose petals."
"My 60 lb dog LOVES these.  She is very picky about food and treats, but eats this readily.  She needs the glucosamine/chondroitin for her knees and even if I hid the pills in cat food, peanut butter, you name it- she wouldn't touch it.  She also has allergies to a lot of common ingredients (chicken, beef, wheat), so really this treat is a lifesaver!"
I love PopChip  Products in general.  Having  a sweet potato variety debut  w  especially  welcome.  I love sweet potatoes and chips made from them.  Excellent flavor and texture.
"I honestly don't know how this product could have garnered so many five-star reviews. I bought it for my senior dogs (14 years old) when their usual joint treats (Pet Naturals of Vermont soft chews) were out of stock, since one of my dogs is very finicky about what glucosamine supplements he'll take, and I had tried everything else available without success. I gave both of them the recommended dosage, based on their weights (15 and 24 lbs), and was delighted to see that they happily accepted the treats.  Within 12 hours, though, my Yorkie had raging diarrhea and my Eskie-poo had vomited forcefully, which was very unusual for both of them. Not realizing it was this product, I tried it again a couple of days after nursing them back to health, with the exact same effect. Internet searches confirmed that other users have similarly reported nasty GI side effects with this product."
"These bags never close well, so if you are a compulsive bag-closer, forget about it. Ah, the taste you ask? Dry, and dusted with its own carnation in powderized form. Snack creators branching out by offering traditional products in slightly different forms results in me expressing negative comments via reviews. And why, oh, why does everything have to be miniaturized in order to appeal to rugrats and the type of people who have to proclaim their brood with stick figure-ish stickers on the back of their vehicle? Please, just go straight for the original ""Chips Ahoy!"" in standard size, pig out, and forget about the kids for six minutes."
"I cannot rate the product because I did not open the jar.  My problem was with negotiating the Amazon purchase.  Although I tried to get it sent to another address along with several other items, it ended up coming to me instead.  The shipping is killer.  So I want to warn those out there to read the email Amazon sends you carefully, or the same thing may happen to you next time you ship something to an address other than your own.  Next time I will buy directly from the merchant instead of going through Amazon.  The shipping was killer.  The 2 stars are for Amazon's shipping pages."
I absolutely love this product!<br />As a home-chef I use this product on just about all of my seafood. It adds a distinct flavor that that takes any fish or seafood to another level of excellence.<br /><br />Great for even the most basic cooks!
"This product is great. The flavor was to die for. I will purchase again, when my sugar high goes away?  : D"
"I've heard that some grade B Maple syrups are too strong.  Maybe so, but this stuff is excellent.  This is the second quart we've received, and the flavour is perfect.  A bit stronger than grade A, but sweet, and very pleasant to my taste.<br /><br />PERSONAL TASTE NOTE: I also like my honey straight from the hive, and unfiltered honey is sometimes a bit stronger, as well, as it has bits of pollen and comb mixed in.  That being said, I have friends who are more finicky and they like this batch of syrup, as well."
"For some reason, I can't find this in the stores or markets in my area, and I can't eat regular pasta, so I as glad to be able to find it this way. I wish I could have ordered a smaller amount, but it is convenient to have in available (in my house) when I want it."
"I love sweet potato and especially sweet potato chips. When I tried the original popchips, I was surprised by how good the taste and texture was, so I bought this in bulk, thinking it would be excellent because of the company and because I love sweet potatoes of course.<br />I was wrong.<br /><br />For some reason, the sweet potato chip they've created tastes like cardboard despite having the same texture (cross between rice cake and chip), added with a dash of salt. That's it. I can't describe it any other way than a ""bland blah taste with salt""<br /><br />I wish I had gotten the parmesean garlic or the original instead."
"I considered buying these but the health risks should be considered.<br /><br />These are cured, stored with salt, and have nitrates.<br /><br />If you look on the american cancer society web site you will see that those are cancer causing concerns.<br /><br />you can still eat well when avoiding such things."
"I am very disappointed that this Happy Hips product is made in China now. If it wasn't for me going into a pet food store that doesn't carry products not made in the USA I would be still feeding this product to my dog. I am really concerned on finding a new product due to my Bichon's allergies, she can only have Lamb. She now sits at the cabinet and cries for her treat. I think I may need to make my own lamb jerkey in my dehydrator. More work but worth it. With no regulations in China who knows what is swept from the floors and put in the product. As we know the packaging is misleading what is misleading in the ingredents. I have been to China it is scary. We take so much for granted in the USA.<br /><br />dp"
i have eaten these chips for years. they are no longer available where i live so i have had to start getting them online. they are usually good. this particular batch wasnt the best i've had. the chips seem too thick and somewhat stale. so its too bad when you get a bad batch and you bought a box of 12. oh well. hopefully my next batch will be better.<br />however they were shipped immediately and arrived over a week before i was expecting them so that was great.
"I was skeptical for a long time about agave nectar and finally gave in and bought this!  Wow!  Wow!  This is so yummy.  I have been baking with it following Elana's Pantry recipes and everything has turned out wonderful.  It is fantastic in salad dressings, smoothies, frostings, cupcakes, and on hot and cold cereal.  AND it is so yummy, you just want to eat it plain! I love that it has a low glycemic index.  This is definitely a new staple in my pantry..and the great price on Amazon makes that possible!"
Tastes like cat food and has a similar consistency. The other mixer flavors are much better.
"I usually make my baby's food.... it's so easy, steam fruits & veggies and puree.... but sometimes I don't have enough time to cook and I buy Earth's Best baby foods....baby likes all the fruits and veggies so far but didn't like this one. She refused to eat it. When I tried it I understood why, I wouldn't eat it myself either... it tastes nasty.... my poor baby.... immediately I made her a homemade potato, zucchini, & asparagus puree and she loved it. I wouldn't recommend this flavor!"
"The popcorn is good but if you want outstanding continue looking. It isn't overly buttery and if your wondering 1- 8oz bag makes 7- 1 1/2 oz bags.<br />My kids who are popcorn addicts like it. It works if your looking to sell it, I tried Gold Medal popcorn that was really good!!"
My cats absolutely would not eat this food so it was a waste of money..it is just sitting in our cabinets.  I will donate it to a shelter...
"My husband and I have enjoyed good coffee for over 25 years.  We're always trying new coffee and our favorite bean has been Sumatra up until now.  We tried Zoka's Colonel Fitzroy a couple month's ago and immediatley decided it was our new favorite.  It's similar to a Sumatra, but has a hint of chocolate unertones.  I love it because I can drink it black.  It has no bitter aftertaste.  Drinking coffee black allows the rich sweetness to resonate and means no calories.  Making it a keeper for sure!"
Very pleased. Expensive but worth the cost to me because of the beautiful soft luster it adds to my baked goods. Shaker and pour openings for easy application.  Ordering more.
I knew my family already liked these chips so it was a no brainer to take advantage of a great price for good chips.  The price per bag can't be beat if you order with subscribe and save and the good thing is you can always change the delivery interval if you notice you go through them quicker or slower than you anticipated.
"You cannot imagine my disappointment.  The other reviewers say just like Grandma's homemade.  I suppose it is possible that my Grandma was a better cook than yours.  These are awful preserves.  And that is the nicest thing I can say about them.<br /><br />The packaging is spectacular, the quality, the flavor and the overall experience eating these preserves is way below par.  I did consume some, just hoping my initial experience was not good.  These preserves are terrible.  These are the worst tasting fig preserves I have ever tasted.  I was so excited reading they are just like Grandma's; I got the cherry flavored one too.  Yikes.<br /><br />Side-by-side, you could not tell the difference in the two jars.  They tasted identical.  The fig did not taste anything like figs and the cherry did not taste anything like cherries.<br /><br />They tasted identical.  They tasted awful.<br /><br />I am very disappointed especially since after reading the other reviewers; I was really excited to have finally found some good fig preserves."
I was very satisfied with the price and quality of the product. I could not find these gluten free cheetos in any store so I was happy to find them online.
This is great pancake and waffle batter that was recommended by Amazon so I bought it and have been very satisfied with my purchase.  It makes the best waffles every time I have used it and that being said I am sold on this product.  I will be ordering more as we really like how easy it is to make.  I would highly recommend that everyone try this who likes pancakes and waffles it is delicious and very economical.
"Seriously, sprinkles are not just for eye pleasing aesthetics but for mouth pleasing texture.  This bag is great value compared to buying the smaller size shakers with different colors. I can use two of containers of  those colors on one batch of 24 cupcakes.  I just have to find a proper container to put the bag ones in so they are easy to shake out onto cupcakes, as that is what I use them for mostly. I'll check on amazon to see if I can find an appropriate shaker.  I may just buy a smaller one (about 10 oz) shaker and use and re-use that one.  My son and I like them also on ice cream, topped with ready whip canned cream. Gives pleasing texture to  ice cream. Yum!"
"So I have sampled and bought my fair share of Everidae sauce and I have to say without a doubt it is the next best thing to put on food.  I will start off by saying I do know the maker of this sauce, and although that may seem like this review is a bit biased, i wanted to be the first to formally state the flavorful blend of this sauce can literally go on everything.<br /><br />I like spicy hotness, and unlike other condiments like Franks Red Hot, this doesn't mask the flavor of the food but adds to it.<br />I have used this sauce on hotdogs, hamburgers, chicken, tacos, and eggs.<br /><br />The mild is a little bit sweeter than the medium and hot(the hot being the heat that I particularly enjoy).  But this stuff can be added to almost any sauce or family recipe to give it that extra kick of spicy sweetness that will make your mouth water."
"I wanted desperately to love, or even like this drink mix, but am not having success doing so. I love mint tea but this tastes all green tea to me. It's too strong a green and too weak a mint flavor for me to enjoy it. Every once in a while I'll try to tolerate a bottle again hoping I change my taste. It's not gross and so clearly is appealing to some people."
"Every morning after they are fed, two of my Poms get Happy Hips and the third wants in on it.  They think it's a great treat and never not want it."
"I find it curious that you can not find this k-cup on Van Houtte's website.  You can find the Raspberry Chocolate Truffle light but not this specific k-cup. Given some of the very negative reviews of this product,  perhaps it is a discontinued item or maybe it is not a Van Houtte product."
"These chips are nasty.  I thought someone had spilled a drink in the bag, no the chips were just soaked with grease.  Nasty!!"
"This popcorn package is a great idea.  It has MANY flaws.  It is very difficult to pour the oil into the popcorn popper.  It is best when you heat the oil for  3-5 minutes and then add the popcorn and seasoning.,  The popcorn does not pop completely.  There are lots of left over kernels that never pop.  I am very disappointed in this product.  I will not purchase this product again."
"I do not like coffee too much. Actually I am very particular about coffee and I can say that this is one of my favorites. It is so smooth and flavorful,the smell is really good and I can't have enough of it.I have gone as far as skipping going to Starbucks or Dunkin for coffee.<br />The price is decent for this kind of product so I highly recommend it."
Just like the tea I remember from childhood.  Large tea bags that allow the flavour to flow fully and perfectly.  Nothing like it available anywhere.  This is real tea!
"This blend is not bitter to wake you up, but a mild end that makes your mornings calm.  A delightful slow approach to a busy day.  No harsh jolts."
"well, my husband, myself and my 12 year old son sampled this drink. My husband hated it. I felt like it was OK, but nothing to write home about. The taste to me was too orangey and for a ""natural"" product it sure didn't taste like one. My 12 year old liked it. He also likes gummy worms and sour straws, so you can take his review for what it is.<br /><br />I personally wouldn't buy this product.<br />2 stars"
"Linguine-style white rice noodles are hard to find. You usually get those skinny angel-hair-type noodles. Thai Kitchen linguine-style noodles is the only product I have found that gives you the satisfying mouth-feel of linguine with the lightness and gluten-free pleasure of a rice pasta. Using the easy box directions for cooking (soaking, really) the noodles, you can make any number of great cold or warm salads with these noodles. I like adding chopped green onions, sesame and peanut oil, hot chili oil, sesame seeds, cilantro, lime juice and anything else you like such as water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, chopped nuts, whatever. I love these noodles and wish they were more available in smaller quantities in more places."
"I love horehound drops and Claey's are the BEST. Plus, they were well priced and they sent them very quickly. I highly recommend them."
This fondant taste great and is easy to work with.  Easy to roll out and takes very little kneading to make it pliable to work with.
"Great selection of chips & very fresh. If you are are looking for a healthy alternative to fried potato chips & don't like the fake taste of baked, these are just the most amazing chips you can eat. I bought 2 cases & every time I'm at Target or our Super Box Store I make sure to pick them up!!"
It was not specified on this site and I did not know until I received the product.  This is something that should be clear on the product page especially since the FDA has specifically warned about chicken jerky products for pets that are made in China.  I am going to ask for a refund.
"This is an excellent product.  I tried a handful that a friend had and I was hooked!  It has good flavor without being too salty.  You can also chop them and add to salads or in green beans.  My kids enjoy them also, good alternative to junk snacks!"
"Tried the original chips - they are crispy, tasty but TOO salty for me. Both chips and packet are light!"
"Not one member of my family, including me, like these extremely salty, much too strong a BQ taste to order more.  I purchased them on a recuring basis and i wish to cancel now.  I have received only one shipment. Cancel further shipments.  Not to our taste at all. These are Lowery pork rinds."
"Buy it! If you have problems with ance, blesmishes, bumps etc then you need to buy it. It brightens your skin and smooths out the texture. The amazing part is that you see IMMEDIATE results! By ""immediate"" I am talking about overnight! Drink it and you will wake up glowing with clear, bright beauiful skin! I have suffered from acne since I was 11 years old. At 35 years old, I can honeslty say this tea works beauiful miracles!"
"Unfortunately, all package size descriptions on the product page are wrong.  These are not 1.25oz packages and they are also not 1oz packages (as stated further down in the description).  They are .08oz packages.  Very disappointed in this fact.  Cherryheads are tasty, though, and the shipping was fast."
"For those who are looking to avoid soy, this product contains soy lecithin which is not listed in the product ingredients in the Amazon description.  The candy packaging does not indicate ""organic non-GMO soy"" so it likely derives from (as does most soy) genetically modified sources. Soy lecithin is a waste product created when crude soybean oil is ""degummed"". After some searching, found some outstanding chocolate with no soy lecithin - Alter Eco.  This chocolate has a variety of flavors - midnight crunch with quinoa, dark chocolate mint, cacao, etc .  I have tried all three and they are excellent.  I do not think they have a coconut - which is why I bought the Oskri.  Alter Eco is USDA organic, fair trade, vegan, gluten free, soy and GMO free, no chemicals at all, no emulsifies.  Very good - should not be this hard to find food that is pure, simple and has no nasty additives.  Oh,before I read the fine print on the wrapper, I did try this, good flavor, fairly tough and chewy consistency but not bad flavor."
"I love that this drawer holds so many k-cups! Its great to have them right under the machine. Its great for those times when I am having company, I can load it up with what I know they like. Each time someone different comes over, I can just simply put their choices in the drawer and they can make a fresh beverage any time they want, they dont need to dig in my pantry or come get me to make something for them. Handy to have! I love it!"
"Delicious!  Because of the fine grind, I thought the coffee might be a little bitter, but it's not.  It's delicious and smooth.  My favorite coffee is Caribou, but this is not far behind.  I followed the instructions exactly, using two teaspoons per 6oz of water.  I have a coffee maker where you put the beans in one side, and the water in the other, and press a button. . .  so measuring ground coffee is not my thing, but this worked great.  I didn't have a problem using it in my non-Melitta coffee maker at all.  Very enjoyable.  .. rich flavor. . . smooth. . . What's not to like? ;-)"
"I have tried many brands of medium roast coffees however, this is my favorite. Some I've tried are bitter; some are too light; some are too strong; but this one for me is just right! Some brands more than others come in all puffed up and when punctured, the grounds filter out into the needle of the Keurig coffee maker and has to be cleaned which isn't difficult, just annoying. Never had a problem with these.  Breakfast in Bed k-cups are smooth, not too light and not too strong, right smack in the midddle. No bitter after taste either and perfect any time of day. Enjoy!"
"This is the best cornmeal. I made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding. Also fried some oysters with this meal, it gave them a great texture and flovor."
"This was a disappointment.  I use other products from this line/manufacturer on a regular basis.  I bought this item as a convenience to carry liquid Stevia in my purse.  The first time I went to use it, the liquid was a dark color...almost black..and I had to throw out the latte I was trying to sweeten.  All the manufacturer's other liquid products are clear, and, in fact, this is titled ""clear liquid"".  It must have been outdated/spoiled. I had already thrown the packing out, so don't know how it was dated.  I tried calling the Amazon supplier, but the call rolled into voice mail.  It's not enough money to spend time following-up, but it was disappointing."
What can I say about man's best friend other than he deserves the best treats possible.  It was almost as if our dog Shultz knew what was in the box and sat up begging for a treat when we opened the bag.<br /><br />The treats do seem a bit hard but our Doxie just loved them.  It's nice to be able to give a healthy organic treat instead of chemically processed treats.  Your pet will not be disappointed when you hand out these little square snacks.
"I eat these tuna cups (or the salmon cups) almost daily.<br /><br />If you're looking for a nutritious snack, these cups really can't be beat.  If you're a bodybuilder or athlete trying to increase your daily protein intake, these are awesome.  If you're a parent trying to get your kid to eat healthy, getting them to like fish is a great idea.  If you're trying to eat 5-7 meals a day to lose weight, make one of these cups one of your meals, the protein fills you up and makes you feel good.  It also requires a bit of chewing to complete the eating experience.<br /><br />Why eat a nutritionally empty ""100 calorie pack"" of goldfish crackers or potato chips when you could have something like this that has only 80 calories and infinitely more nutritional benefit??<br /><br />I'll eat these alone, straight from the cup, basically anywhere since you don't need to refridgerate and you don't need a can opener.  I'll dump them onto salad, or mix with rice, quinoa, or beans.<br /><br />Here's the nutrition data off the back (for 1 2.7oz cup) at the time of writing:<br /><br />Calories 80 (10 from fat)<br />Total Fat 1g<br />Cholesterol 35mg<br />Sodium 15mg<br />Total Carb 0g<br />Protein 18g<br />Omega-3 EPA/DHA 200mg<br /><br />You really can't beat this for something so portable that requires no preparation or refridgeration.  The package says ""in water"" but there's a little bit of broth in the cup, and if you squeeze this out or just leave it at the bottom of the cup, you probably cut the sodium down to 10mg.<br /><br />I highly recommend these tuna cups and the salmon cups as well.  But, avoid the tuna salad, or the flavored varieties if you are looking to get the maximum nutritional benefit.  Those salads and flavorings just add salt, sugar, carbs."
"I love Popchips. They may take some time getting used to if you're used to the oiliness of potato chips, but they're only 100 calories per bag. Buying a 24 pack saves you money per bag, but you're sooo tempted to eat them with so many bags around!"
"Before you purchased the product, make sure you know that this cereal has a very strange smell. This is the normal smell of the product. I don't know how to describe the smell, but be careful with your choice.<br />My baby doesn't like the smell."
"I received my shipment today, and tried to microwave four bags using different time settings. Only one or two out of each bag microwave correctly. I even put the unpopped on a plate as someone suggested and nothing. I carefully followed directions for each bag. If I could rate this, a zero I would."
"I've tried a lot of almonds out there but I always seem to come back to these. Nicely sized can and a good deal here on Amazon. Lasts me a while between purchases and saves me money too. What can I say, they're delicious."
"I am constantly trying new foods, and when I read about the nutritious value of almondmilk, I decided to get a two-pack. About two weeks later, I opened my first one and gagged when I added it to my cereal. The taste was just unbearable, and for once, I found my vocabulary lacking in adjectives to describe it's taste. I checked the expiration date, which wasn't for another 8 months, and left it onto my refrigerator. Perhaps I purchased a bad batch, because the other one started bloating just sitting on my counter (I purchased the shelf-life ones and refrigerated them after opening).<br /><br />The only way I can tolerate the taste is to put some protein powder in it and mix it with some agave syrup. I've eaten a lot of MRE's in my time in the Army, and this easily ranks below any nasty thing I've eaten (or drank). I'll stick with my regular 2% milk and continue with a vitamin supplement for nutrition."
great taste and a great way to start the day . I drink one when i get up and one more with lunch.
"I loved my Keurig so much that I bought this one for my mother for her birthday, easter, mothers day, 4th of July, etc.  She loves it just as well and uses it every day.  The best product EVER!<br />Be sure and register your machine you get 2 free boxes of k-cups!"
"I find Droste Cocoa truly the best cocoa I have ever tasted. I also use this chocolate in baking tortes, cookies etc... It also makes a mean hot chocolate."
"Living gluten-free for several years now, it's been a while since I had any ""real"" chocolate chip cookies.  But, I don't remember them being even close to as good as what comes from this mix. They're incredibly easy to make (though we only cook them just over half the time as directed), and even my non-gluten-free family is hooked."
"This water is delicious. I'm not picky, but I can taste bad water with chemicals or metal taste and this has none of that. And at 50 cents per bottle, delivered to your door, it's a great price. I have a teenage son and he drinks these all the time and it's a-okay with me. Better than drinking a coke."
"Locally I was paying around $10 for it. The last time I bought two tins of it because the store owner said he wasn't able to get it anymore. As another other reviewer noted, this is a well kept secret, but one that is incredible if you can find it."
It has artificial sweetener which not only taste bad to me but also gives me a headache. This should say light or diet to let the buyer know this. I would have never bought it had I known. It seems like it would taste good otherwise.
"This version of 5-hr Energy DOES HAVE caffeine. If you read the label carefully, it states that this decaf version has 6mg of caffeine.  I like that it has a smaller amount of caffeine compared to the original."
"These potato chips are DELICIOUS!  I have not had potato chips in approximately two years as it has been difficult to find organic chips.  Amazon lowered the price on these, and I finally had a chance to order them.  I most definitely will be ordering them again!  My family and I love them.  They are pure and void of all artificial flavorings.  The true flavor is present, and it satisifies the need for something salty, sweet, spicy, and crunchy.  A++++"
"This food might have great contents, but my 7 1/2 lb, 11/2 yr old poodle doesn't like the taste. She's not a picky eater."
"I would we willing to try this product, and have six envelopes in my cupboard, but unfortunately the instructions are in German.  Maybe I can hire an interpreter??"
"Aspen Mulling eggnog mix does not taste exactly like real eggnog, but pretty darn close. It is a bit sweeter and not as rich as real eggnog, unless you mix with cream and milk (the manufacturer recommends mixing with milk). I add a touch of vanilla and nutmeg to the mix, and use it to make eggnog lattes. Delicious, and now I enjoy eggnog lattes year-round. I find that I can make an eggnog latte using this product that tastes more like eggnog than using real eggnog. When mixed with fat free half and half, you can enjoy the taste of eggnog with no cholesterol, no fat, and low carbohydrates. If you mix with regular half-and-half, even creamier. When mixing, let it stand for 10 to 15 minutes before using. No need to mix and let stand overnight, tends to separate out if left sitting overnight."
I will never know how this product is.<br />Amazon/Starbucks chose to send this order with the requirement I sign for it!  Why they would do this on a $20.00 order is beyond me.  I work and am not home to sign for packages.  The package was returned and Amazon/Starbucks has yet to reply to my emails or even return my money.<br />This in my first Amazon disappointment and I have ben a customer for nearly 10 years.
"First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats"
"Hershey has closed their Reading, PA plant and moved the production of York Peppermint Patties (along with other candies) to MEXICO. Although cutting thousands of US jobs and moving to another country evidently hasn't brought the price down, just the quality (and probably safety) of the product. Look for Pearson's Mint Patties instead, they're still MADE IN THE USA, and they're usually cheaper as well."
This is NOT Disco Dust which is edible and made for baking. DO NOT purchase this product for such purposes!
"I have loved Honey Nut Cheerios for as long as I can remember. They brought my little childhood tummy so much joy. Now, as a full grown man, they serve as nostalgic snack and perfect sponge to my evening's frivolous consumption of whiskey, enabling me to wake up the next morning clear-headed...and ready for a bowl of Honey Nut Cheerios."
I have been giving these chews to my Mini-Pincher and Mini-Dauchand for the past 3 years to help support their joints and hips.  The last batch I bought is darker in color to the point of almost being burnt and smells a lot more.  It made my Mini-Pincher sick to the point of vomiting and liquid stools.  I am going to shop for a better product that is made here in the US . . . I have been looking at GNC products for Dogs and that is probably the route I will take.
"I feed my dog Royal Canine brand which I typically have to mix with chicken stick or wet canned food for her to eat - I thought this stuff would be more flavorful and easy to serve.  Upon opening I could tell I made a mistake - smells like cardboard - my dog won't eat it no matter how I dress it up, much less could I get her to eat it plain.  Plus, it has none of the science behind it like higher end brands like Royal Canine - the Newman brand is spreading itself too thin here - they should stick with pasta sauce."
"This is the most original root beer I've ever had. It has a kick: one for your head with the guarana (most energy drinks have this) and one for your tongue (it has capsaicin, the part of hot peppers that burn your mouth). This combination sounds weird i with cane sugar, but this is my favorite soda.<br /><br />I find that either people love this or hate it so try it at your grocery store first before you buy a case."
"What is supposed to be the purpose of this soda? ""100% juice""--but not 100% of what's on the front of the label. Kiwi, raspberry, and strawberry juice concentrates are lesser ingredients; apple and grape juice are in the majority. And so what if it has 100% of the RDA of Vitamin C. So do a lot of other things. Is it possible to OD on vitamin C?<br /><br />The bottom line, though, is no matter what the combination of juices is, it tastes like cheap candy. Not pleasant at all."
"The moment I opened the bag I did not smell the wonderful smell of coffee, as I sniffed close to the opening I finally smelled the coffee and it smelled stale.  When I brewed my first cup, the odor still remained stale with the addition of smelling like the second brew from used grounds.  This really affected my reaction and taste to the coffee.  The smell of coffee is appetizing and enhances the taste, but since I already had an issue with the smell, the coffee ended up tasting weak and stale.  The process of removing most of the acid must affect the taste and smell as well as color because it took away the best parts of coffee, the appetizing smell, the rich slight bitter taste, and the dark, smoky caramel color.  I decided to use the rest of the grounds as an odor neutralizer, but even that was not as effective, it did not neutralize other smells like regular acidic coffee.  I guess I will stick to regular coffee, truthfully instant coffee smells and tastes better than this low acid coffee."
"I do not particularly care for this coffee. However, in all fairness to the product - this was my last ditch effort to find a decaf coffee that I like. I truly enjoy regular Colombian, organic coffee. I have tried other, non-organic decafs before and was dissatisfied. I thought maybe an organic version would suit my taste buds. Considering that I always find decaf coffees less than enjoyable, please do not take my review as ""gospel"". I would recommend that anyone who is trying to reduce their caffeine intake should try this product and make up your own mind. I only drink 1 1/2 cups of coffee in the morning. So, I'm not abusing caffeine. However, I think I just enjoy the flavor of ""real"" coffee too  much to enjoy the taste of straight decaf. Currently, I'm doing a scoop of regular organic coffee and a scoop of HealthWise. At least I'm getting closer to my ""caffeine free"" goal. :-)"
"These are wonderful!  But, they are small, so I usually eat 2 at at time.  And... will melt easily and are hard to get off the paper.  So, I keep them in the fridge.  LOVE THEM!!"
"These treats literally made my dog sick, throwing up everywhere. And it wasn't a shock when i read the package which stated Made in China. Weren't chicken treats for dogs that are made in China recalled?"
"My kids loves Chips Ahoy! and I will have them once in a while as well.  But the kids refuse to eat them from this Family Size package.  Once I tasted them, I knew why.  They have an awful medicinal taste.  Really bad.  I don't what the problem is, but if you like Chips Ahoy, you will not like these.  Go elsewhere."
"Some years ago I was introduced to chai tea. I started drinking Tazo but then tried Big Train at Nordstroms. I was definitely love, at first taste!. I was buying it from that department store but it became too expensive. When I discovered it on Amazon and that I could order through subscribe and save, there was no more deciding. I also have my sister drinking it as well and she has an account established through me. As I stated it before, it's the best ever and I drink it everyday!!!"
"These cookies had a horrible taste, nothing like the sesame cookies we get in New Jersey. Too many flavors competing with the anise. Yuck."
"I did not find this product to be oily at all.  I buy them at our local health food store and mix them with a variety of organic nuts, raisins and coconut. Everyone I've shared them with has enjoyed them a well.  Maybe the other reviewer just happened to get a bad batch?  Who knows, but our family loves this product."
"I dislike most ""diet"" snacks -- like baked  potato chips. But the barbecue pop chips taste as good or better than most non-diet snacks. I did not care for the vinegar and salt & pepper varieties -- and haven't tried the others yet -- but the BBQ chips are great. I make sure I always have these in the house."
"My 6-month-old is a fanatic for these flavors!  She gobbles them up and we can't load the spoon fast enough for her!  We introduce new foods every 3 days and we always get the interesting blends as well, so she has tried tons of flavor profiles by this point and these really do get a notable reaction from her.  She goes, ""Mmm, mmm,"" lol.  It's so cute and meats are an easier-to-absorb source of iron compared to artificially-enriched iron that is found in baby cereals.  I definitely prefer this as a compliment to Mommy's milk as oppose to the cereals that are hard for little tummies to digest."
"I searched for unsweetened cranberries on the Amazon website. These come up. The bag is folded a bit in your picture so the ""sweetened with apple concentrate"" is not clear. This food is loaded with sugar. I'll give them away, since I can't return them. You need to fix the search on this product so it does not come up as ""unsweetened cranberries."""
"Looks good, but does not open and close smoothly.  The drawer has medal feet that fit into a groove in the bottom of the unit as a track.  The tray sticks a lot and you have to hold the top of the unit to jerk the drawer out."
"I am currently deployed so getting good coffe like we can easily access back at home isn't always readily available. But this canister has still lasted us quite a bit and everyone loves the taste. and considering our location, it got here within a reasonable amount of time."
"We just got the Great Northern Princeton popper a few weeks ago and also sent a 24 count prepackaged case of the Great Northern 8oz pop corn. The kids (11 and 6) really love it... They actually do the popping themselves. I have just ordered the auto buy/shipping option for having them delivered every 3 months. Got a 15% discount to do it and makes it really convenient and saved a bit also. The kids have raved about the popcorn and the popper also,,,so its been a rally good deal for us. This popcorn is very healthy for the kids (Check out the actual info about the product with Coconut oil). If there are any problems in the future I will amend this rating. Hears hoping that this works out well."
Great organic Earl Grey tea. I used an automatic tea maker on the medium brew setting. The black tea had a nice smooth flavor with a gentle bergamot aftertaste. I highly recommend this loose tea.
"I use this to record in GarageBand on my MacBook. It works unfailingly and sounds as good as it should considering my primitive setup. I love the level knob and the quality construction. If you read the instructions and use it correctly, this tool is invaluable."
"UPDATE:  My original review is below this update. but if you are looking for the original Spear O Mint flavor (which is great), these are now the ""new and improved"" flavor which is terrible.  It is not just a slight difference, it is a complete overhaul.  It is more like Pep-O-Mint with an overpowering chemical flavor.  It seems someone at the company must have decided since some people like ""conspicuously strong mints"" we should sell them.  Unfortunately instead of leaving my favorite flavor Life Saver alone and coming out with a new strong mint, they made the foolish decision to re-flavor these.  I actually started choking on them it was so bad.  I thought it was just a mistake (I've had Pep-O-Mint occasionally mixed in a pack of Wint-O-Green or Spear-O-Mint before), but I quickly realized no, it is just the ""new and [not] improved"" flavor.  I've contacted the company previously (when they started adding artificial sweetener to some of the regular flavors) and they told me that their ""taste tests"" revealed that folks preferred the new flavor.  I think they must have found a test panel of folks who like the aftertaste of artificial sweetener.  I'm going to complain to the company again, but it will probably once again fall on deaf ears.<br /><br />MY ORIGINAL REVIEW [based on the original flavor Spear-O-Mint, which I also gave 5 stars]<br />These have become extremely hard to find.  It seems that the stores believe there is only a market for sugarless mints.  I hate sugarless products and the associated throat dryness that comes with consuming them.<br />These are great tasting, sweetened with sugar, and also seem to act as an upset stomach reliever."
"It has been mentioned that you only use HALF the Splenda blend than regular brown sugar, which is very cool. The only problem I have run into is when I need brown sugar for volume (making a crust for my rhubarb crunch), half does not work, so I end up using regular brown sugar (rather than double Splenda). Other than that it works like a charm and you can hardly taste the difference!"
"The ""reviewer from Florida"" was being extremely kind in their review.<br />This gruel is not even fit for farm animals.  I've lived in Hawaii most<br />of my life and have shopped mostly in the local health food stores-so i have had<br />many many different batches of Basmati rice.  What Amazon has sent me is NOT<br />edible in my opinion.  It is not long grained as Basmati should be and does not<br />cook as it should - it fully cooks too soon and does not need the full amount of<br />water that Basmati usually does.<br />I am tempted to contact the FDA to see what it really is!<br /><br />My apologies to the ""reviewer from Florida"" - i should have listened to you and<br />passed on all this frustration - Amazon does not allow returns on groceries.<br />Needless to say - i am now stuck with several pounds of inedible rice."
"These treats don't last, my dog can pop them out in a matter of minutes, and it's completely gone in about 5 minutes.  Add to that the seller I purchased from only sent me one (they come in packs of 2, seller opened it and only sent me one treat), I was very disappointed.  Never going to bother with these again."
"Unfortunately, this product was not enjoyable. I've been using canned pumpkin to make soup and to add to tomato sauce, but they did not taste right with this canned pumpkin. It leaves a starchy almost gritty aftertaste/texture. My only positive comment is that none of the cans were dented."
"I used Cavenders Greek seasoning for the first time several years ago when my sister sent me 2-8 oz. containers as part of a birthday gift.  It is one of the best, most useful and prolific gifts I have ever received.  I use this seasoning on chicken, beef, pork and seafood dishes and in soups and stews as well.  This is one of the best seasonings I have ever used.  I refuse to cook without it. I use the salt free Cavenders as often as I use the Cavenders with salt.  Whatever your choice,I suggest that everyone who wants to pump up the flavor of their foods try this seasoing and like me, you will make it a staple in your household."
Item came promptly however the crisps were 3 months past their freshness date. Was told I would get replacements.  Still waiting.
The serving recommendations on the can don't seem to be correct. I really didn't like the tea as they recommended brewing it.<br /><br />I suggest you use only 1 tsp per 8oz. Boil water and let cool to 180 degrees.<br /><br />1st: 1 min<br />2nd: 30 seconds<br />3rd: 1.5 min
"I used to think it was the best. Bought it when Amazon was having a one-day sale, which made its price pretty much the same as Coffee People Donut Shop (our regular brew). If we could get this Newman coffee at a matching price always, we would switch to it. It's dark and strong, without being bitter. Love it. (Edit 5/5/2011: I have now decided the Van Houtte Eclipse blend is my #1 favorite.)"
I eat a handful of these walnuts daily for Omega 3 fatty acids with a diet coke as a great snack.  I eat 1 bag per week.  They taste great & they always have tasted fresh.  I empty 1 bag of walnuts in a plastic storeage container & either keep it in the fridge or in a kitchen cabinet.  I am about to order subscribe & save to save 6.00 on my next order.  I am sure that they would be great for baking as they are nicely chopped.
"I received a single 8.5 once container of ONE Coconut water with a splash of Pineapple as part of the Amazon Vine program for review.<br /><br />It would have been nice if it had come with a straw, especially considering the price of the product. Now as to the ""Splash of Pineapple"", well it must not have been a very big splash, because I never did taste any pineapple. So what did I taste? It is hard to describe. It doesn't taste like coconut or cane sugar or any ""Natural Fruit flavor"".<br /><br />To be honest, it tastes like water,...sort of. Like water with an odd, undefinable extra flavor. It's not a bad flavor or a good flavor, it's just Meh! flavor. I don't care how ""healthy"" this drink is supposed to be, for it's price, it should have a better flavor, or just have a flavor.<br /><br />And as a ""thirst quencher"", it doesn't equal up to Gatorade or even a Lemonade. I feel a glass of tap water would do just as good as job to quench your thirst."
"I am a fan of several of the Mio liquids (i especially like the lemonade) and I use the Mio Energy Black Cherry almost daily. I thought that it wouldn't be too much of a reach to try the ""Green Thunder"" Mio Energy. I really, really did not like it. While I appreciate the caffeine and the B vitamins I greatly prefer the Black Cherry flavor. To me ""green Thunder"" tastes like green apple flavored medicine... very bad medicine.<br /><br />So of the flavors that I have tried<br /><br />Lemonade (Mio Liquid) - Very good - it has become one of my preferred drinks - easily 5 stars<br /><br />Fruit Punch (Mio Liquid) - Good but not great flavor - a little too artificial tasting - 4 stars<br /><br />Black Cherry -(Mio Energy) - I like it but I have had better tasting cherry drinks - I prefer it over ""Vitamin Squeeze"" 4 1/2 Stars<br /><br />Green Thunder - (Mio Energy) - Tastes like medicine - easily my least favorite flavor - 2 stars (I added a star because of the caffeine)"
"I love hazelnut creamers and syrups so I thought I'd love this one.  Nope!  I usually buy the Starbucks Hazelnut syrup.  I figured this would be the same, but something about the Torani brand Hazelnut syrup is funky.  I gave all 3 bottles away to family.  Hopefully they'll enjoy it more than I did."
"I was wondering how my cookies which were a spin on the America's Test Kitchen perfect chocolate chip cookie recipe could have come out tasting like crud. Well it was the butterscotch chips. I basically took ATK's recipe and adjusted it for oatmeal insead of the chocolate chip by using their base and adding oats, raisins, chopped mac nuts, cinnamon and these chips. It would have been just as amazing as the chocolate chip cookie recipe if I would have ommitted these chips. Now as another reviewer said, the cookies with the chips in it are destined for the trash."
"I could not wait to get my tea in the mail!  My favorite type of tea is Oolong for it's fruity, sweet flavor.  And then add peach to this?!  AWESOME!  What a great blend!  I think the peach may be a little too over powering of the Oolong, but I still love this tea.  Not to mention, it's fresh.  You can always tell if tea is too old.  This tea was really really fresh.<br /><br />Loose leaf tea is usually pricey, and Oolong is even pricer.  I usually can only afford 2 or 4 oz at a time.  But this tea is a HUGE bargain!  I feel like I got a huge deal.  I opened the sealed bag (also comes with a resealable ziplock just inside) and was so surprised by how much tea is in here.  This is going to last me a long time - yay!  It says it's 8 ounces, but looking at it, it seems like it's more like 12 ounces.  Maybe it's my imagination?<br /><br />This is my first time buying Boston Tea, but I don't think it will be my last.  I'm excited to try more teas by them."
"I've used this item for stunning drink presentations but have routinely been entertaining ""self"" at home.  The syrup's amazing and the flower is edible.  The flower stuns everyone at first but when they taste, they thoroughly enjoy.  I have purchased this a number of times.  Amazon use to carry the larger, 11 oz. jar but I did not see it on this last purchase.  This product's become a staple in my house. I also use the syrup to mix with other items (fruit dips, desserts, ice cream, etc.)"
My dogs like this a lot. They are willing to do any tricks for this. They have it for over three years and still love it.
"I have ordered these cookies many times....normally LOVE them!!! But the last two times I've bought them, they have been stale."
"This is my wife's absolute favorite Earl Grey.  Me, I find that while the Bergamot flavor is nice, I like a tea base that is a bit brisker."
"Wow.<br />For those on a gluten & dairy-free diet, these are ideal as a quick snack, something to keep in a purse or glove box. My partner has some very strict dietary needs (Chron's) and seldom is something available for her that not only tastes good, but doesn't come at a cost to her digestive system.<br />This is perfect!"
Treat yourself and your loved ones to a vintage treat!<br />You won't regret it.
"I love Cocoa Krispies and it was nice to find them in bulk via online. When I bought this item, it was a very good price. I no longer order from here because price went up almost 3 times from when I first ordered. I don't recommend anyone buy at this price. Walmart has in stores for less than $3 a box same size."
These chips (all flavors of the variety pack) are really terrible.  I have thrown away a lot of them and suffered through eating some of them.  They are over spiced and nasty.
"I bought this product because I thought it might make a good backpacking food and not because it is low in fat/calories. I really wanted to like this product but, I do not like the taste or the fact that there is added sugar. A lot of people seem to like the taste though so, I am not unhappy I gave it a try. I will keep it and try using it as a flavoring in cooking."
"You don't need salt to hide the taste of potato chips. And these chips prove it. The taste of the potato comes through, instead of being masked. OK, so they're still a snack food, but no salt and no trans-fats mean these are about the healthiest potato chips you can get. And if you're on a low-salt diet (like I am), having these available means I can eat chips, and Kettle are just the best."
"Switch's Kiwi Berry drink I found a little on the light side, in many ways.  Only 8.3 ounces with very little in the way of kiwi or strawberry flavoring (the can claims raspberry also and it was MIA also).  The most stand out flavor I could detect was the apple juice, which is the major ingrediant.  While this is 100% juice (from concentrate though) and nicely bubble (I shook mine up prior to drinking, no massive explosion or anything and I'm at altitude), I'd rather drink something something with either a little more flavor or a little more of it."
"My vet gave me this tip. I have had two cats with digestion problems, problems that they liked to make mine! My vet suggested 1/2 jar for a 10 lb or larger cat, 1/4 jar for a less<br />than 10 lb cat...per day or every other day. For some reason this settles their stomachs.<br />And they stopped purging on my carpet or my down comforter! They think it is a kitty treat.<br />I think it is a miracle."
This iced tea is terrible. This is the first Stash product that I do not enjoy. It is not iced tea. It tastes more like powdered peppermint leaves.
"If you are ordering cookies, beware, the 'cookies' arrived in crumbles, so, if you want a box of stale crumbs order away :)"
"Amazon had this as buy one get one free and since it was my favorite, I could not resist.  Great purchase."
"I feed prowl because it is a high quality healthy food that does not break my budget.  It is much cheaper than other premium wet foods (Wellness, Weruva, etc), and my cat seems to like it.  The only downside to prowl is that, since it is dehydrated, you must mix it with water and wait 10 minutes before serving.  My kitten meows at me the entire time.<br />I started my cat on Prowl because my vet offered a free sample. She ate it right away with no problems.  However, she'd only ever had ""healthy"" food, so I was not transitioning from an unhealthy grain filled (but addictively tasty) food.<br />It is very easy to digest and may be a solution for cats with digestion problems.  I recommend (like another reviewer) that you order a free sample and give it a try."
"I have purchased Thai Sticky Rice (Sweet rice)from amazon a couple of times already, and I am always impressed on how fast and reliable they are in terms of shipment. I am happy with the service, and the recipient of the product has always been happy as well because he said that the sticky rice is very good.<br /><br />I will always purchase this product from amazon because as a customer, I am indeed very satisfied with the service.<br /><br />Thank you."
"IN A NUTSHELL: THIS REALLY MADE ME INTO A BELIEVER IN 'CERTIFIED ORGANIC' PRODUCTS<br /><br />Everything that one could want in a boxed 'Macaroni & Cheese' meal is in this excellent product from 'Annie's Homegrown'. Its ingredients are 'Certified Organic', with real cheese and whole wheat pasta. The rusult is a very healthy fast-food that tastes significantly better, creamier, richer and more satisfying than its processed counterpart and WITHOUT COSTING THAT MUCH MORE!<br /><br />I had never heard of this product until I received a sample of it in the mail several months ago. Now, I exclusively consume only this 'Annie's' brand Mac & Cheese, and essentially refuse the other major brands which do contain artificial ingredients. I have tried many of the different varieties that Annie's offers and have been universally satisfied thusfar.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY BUT I DO BUY AND EAT THIS STUFF]"
I'm a nanny granny and it's very convenient to have my sweet grandbaby's food delivered to the door. Sometimes it can be a bit of a challenge to get to the store.
"LOVE IT!!!  I have so far tried the watermelon, the cherry and now kiwi and this is my favorite one. It is all fruit juice and it is tangy, fruity and wonderful! It has in it the following in this order: 100%juice sparkling water, apple,grape,kiwi,acerola cherry,raspberry and strawberry. The raspberry adds a little more zing then the other flavors but they are all really excellent. You can taste a little of all the fruits in this drink but the raspberry, strawberry and kiwi jump out the most. I would recommend this to anyone. Would make a great mixed drink but it's so good you probably won't get that far. Really good stuff!"
This was my first purchase of any gluten free cheese curls and I was pleasantly surprised by the taste and the crunch.  My husband even likes them and he is very picky about his snack foods. To me they taste better than the other name brand cheese curls and with less fat and calories.
I paid for 100 k cups but received only 98! This is the second time this has happened.I didn't think such about it the first time. Now I wonder if this happens often or even all the time.
These look like typical sugar plum jellies but they are actually grape flavored. You would assume that they would have a sugar plum flavor. They taste like cheap Kool-Aid and not the yummy Jelly Belly ones I can't seem to find on Amazon.
"This is a great product.  So easy to use,  makes consistent coffee every time"
"t may be expresso grind, but if you are expecting lovely dark aromatic coffee for your espresso maker: think again. Bitter when drunk on own. Marginally better when combined with milk in cappuchino. I shoulda known betta!"
The ingedients and farming methods are impressive.  More impressive is the dog's reaction to these treats.  Wave one and I can get him to do almost anything.  Good dog.  Really good treats.
"Seeds are a staple in my household, I always have flax for baking, hemp seeds for snacking, and chia for added protein, iron, calcium, and omega-3s in my daily morning smoothies. I know you can add chia seeds to salads, but I don't personally prefer the taste. They don't really have any taste, so they aren't bad, just not something I would personally eat a spoonful of. Chia seeds are an important to my daily routine because they have a decent amount of iron and don't hurt my stomach. I'm very sensitive to iron supplements, and don't eat meat, Chia seeds is something my doctor recommended I try to add to my diet, and he and I are both glad I did. Navitas Naturals makes excellent products, and I have purchased many of their brand items. In my freezer right now is their raw maca powder, cacao nibs, flax seeds, mulberries, acai powder, wheatgrass, and goji berries. I am always impressed with the freshness and quality. I have not noticed any processing remnants in their products, and they always arrive fresh from Amazon, who seems to have a much better turnaround time than my local Whole Foods. And the price is unbeatable. My favorite smoothie is 1 cup of almond milk, 1 scoop of wheat grass or Amazing Grass, a huge spoon of whatever nut butter is in freshly made, 1 teaspoon chia seeds, 1 tablespoon hemp seeds or hemp protein powder, 1 tablespoon cacao nibs, two huge handfuls of spinach, a banana, and ice. This tides me over from 6 am until I eat lunch around 1. (The Chia contribute a lot, since they gel up when in contact with liquid, they leave you feeling fuller for longer) I'd prefer to give 4.5 stars for nutritional benefits and ease of incorporation, but like I said, the taste is lacking. It is not nutty, despite their claims. It's really a ""non-flavor"" and wish they didn't lead you to believe most people would want to just snack on these as they are."
"Good!,,,,<br /><br />We bough fenugreek seeds for my blood sugars treatment, we make tea and drink every day, I like this tea and my blood sugar down. This is good product to buy.<br />Thanks"
This is my house's go to breakfast blend coffee.  Not too strong- but not weak we find the flavor very enjoyable and it a nice middle of the road coffee for guests.  My wife likes with cream and sugar but tastes equally at home black.  Doesn't seem to have a ton of pep- I can drink multiple cups in a sitting.  A little planning ahead (2 days with FREE PRIME shipping) and this package is a much better deal than the big boxes or supermakets.  Highly recommended.
"I lived in Italy for 5 years and became addicted to this espresso confection.  The problem is, you can only get it in the winter months, and it has been hard to find stateside.<br />As I found via Amazon, I felt it would be a good deal.  Truth be told, the day after I ordered, I found twice the quantity on Ebay for only $15.00 more directly from a Ebay store in Germany.  I bet you can guess where I will be buying from next year!  If you love Pocket Coffee, check out Ebay 1st."
"According to the research I've done and my vet's recommendation Eukanuba is the right brand for my Dachshund.  I tried Orijen for a few months when he was about 2 years old but my dog's weight skyrocketed from 16 to 22lbs.  My vet thought the Orijen was the cause and recommended I switch back to Eukanuba.  After I put him back on this Dachshund formula he dropped the weight and is back to a healthy 16 lb.  He's now 4.5 years old and doing great.<br /><br />If I thought there was a better brand of food for him I would be open to trying it, but I feel good about giving him this Eukanuba Dachshund Formula.  I also can't find this locally so I am happy to buy it on amazon."
"Apple Crisps were my original pick until I noticed that they were made/imported from Asia. I normally veer away from packaged foods with long expiration dates, so Apple Harvest was my most sensible, natural choice. They definitely taste better than Apple Crisps and even my young kids like them better."
"Buying pet food can and is a tricky proposition.  This review is about dog food, Purina One, Smartblend, to be specific.  You can spend hours; no, days actually, researching various dog foods on line and via various publications.  Name a brand and you will find many who will defend it right down to the matt.  On the other hand, the same brand will have its distracters; folks who absolutely hate the stuff.  If you care about your dog (and you really should not have a dog if you don't care about it or them), then you need to do your research and do what you feel is best for your animal.  Now let me make one statement before I write the review...it is a rather important statement:<br /><br />If you dog gets sick on any given dog food, then for goodness sakes throw the stuff out, stop feeding your dog that food, and try something different!<br /><br />We have, at this time, four dogs.  They range from 9 pounds to 35 pounds and from two years old to 14 years old.  My wife and I have had dogs all of our lives; cats too, but we are primarily dog people.  We have been using Purina products for years and have been quite happy with the results.  We have healthy dogs and we go to great lengths to keep them that way.<br /><br />At present, and for the past four or five years, we have been using Purina ONE, Smartblend - Lamb & Rice Formula.  We have had great results with it.  There has been no weigh loss nor any weight gains - as long as we keep them on this stuff.  The only problems we do have is that our dogs absolutely LOVE people food and they are garbage guts when it comes to finding delicious ""things"" in the yard and in the woods.  People food and ""things"" usually bring on a case of diarrhea or in some cases, vomiting.  We take care that this does not happen but quite often we find the dogs are much smarter than we are and they are all four most certainly skilled beggars.<br /><br />Purina, as far as I can find, is manufactured here in the U.S.  Yes, they are owned by the Swiss company Nestle, but it would seem that the food is made here in the U.S.  Someone correct me if I am wrong please.<br /><br />If you compare the stuff in this food with that of other brands, it stacks up quite well.  All of our dogs prefer this food over other brands we have tried from time to time (more about that later), of course it must be remembered that all four are quite happy with four day old road killed possum - if they can get it.  The lamb seems to have a more soothing effect on them and they do not seem to have the problems digesting it as they do other meat additives.  Now don't get me wrong, they would prefer that we served them baked chicken (their absolute most favored food on earth) each day, but that ain't a going to happen!<br /><br />It should be noted that any time you change dog food brands or dog food mixes, you are going to have some digestive problems with your dogs.  It will almost always cause diarrhea or loose stools.  If you must change brands or contents, do it slowly, mixing the new brand with the old gradually over several days.  This is a pain, but it is worth it.<br /><br />We buy this stuff in the 18 pound bags here locally and the price is a bit higher, per pound, than we find here on Amazon...although that varies from month to month. If you have Amazon Prime then the shipping is not a factor to fret about.<br /><br />Overall, we are happy with this food and will be unless we learn differently or if our dogs start doing poorly. There are other dog foods of equal quality out there and the challenge is to find one that suits your particular dog's needs. This stuff does the job for us.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarks"
"I generally don't have a very discerning palate when it comes to coffee. Almost any coffee becomes drinkable with enough flavored creamer. So when I made Puroast Low Acid Coffee, I wanted to have a second opinion. I made it for my roommate, whose time in the Pacific Northwest turned her into a bit of a coffee snob.<br /><br />First, I opened the package and smelled the coffee. It had the aroma of one of those motel room brews--the kind that aren't fabulous but will do the trick when you need some caffeine. Then I made the coffee in my Gevalia coffee maker. I sampled it black to get the true flavor. That flavor was ... burned. Even after adding a generous amount of liquid creamer, the coffee still tasted burned. Next, I gave some to my roommate. She put some half and half in hers, and she could barely choke it down. The coffee was completely unpalatable, and we dumped the rest of the pot down the drain.<br /><br />While I like the idea of a low acid coffee, I cannot recommend this brand."
"I loved these Wintergreen Altoid Smalls so much, I had to come write a review. The packaging is small for convenience, and the Altoids are smaller as well with a square shape, blue hue, and even more delicious taste in my opinion. I definitely prefer them over the regular-size Altoids and will continue purchasing them! Highly recommended!"
Just about 9 out of 10 of these would not work in my machine.  Its not my machine we have run hundreds of cups of coffee through it without an issue.  Had to toss most of them in the trash and clean up the mess they made.  They would just stop filtering about a third of the way then just pop and spill grinds everywhere!
"I bought a case of Merrick Surf & Turf with high hopes for my clutter of nine cats.  Alas, the hype didn't live up to the reality.  The product is essentially a wasted purchase, as virtually none of the cats will touch the stuff.  I'll be donating the rest of the case to my local animal shelter for their pet food pantry.<br /><br />The ingredient list drew me to the product, being grain-free, and offering a nice mix of meat and seafood, plus lots of complex carbohydrates for filler.  Upon opening the can, it was clear that the beef and beef fat content was pretty high, with little seafood scent detectable.  It came out of the can in big globs that were sticky to try to mush down for my gang.  Have tried two feedings for my gang with this stuff, and they just can't be convinced that it's both tasty and good for them.<br /><br />I realize that different cats have different sets of taste buds and some cats will eat anything, but when none of my nine will touch the stuff, I can't recommend it to anyone with an even semi-finicky cat, as a number of my gang will eat most anything, and to find them turning up their noses at this somewhat pricey stuff is kinda eye-popping.  If you're cat is very picky, but you know s/he likes beef, then this flavor will probably appeal to him/her, but otherwise, I wouldn't spend your hard-earned moolah on this stuff.  Save your money and your frustration.<br /><br />I give it two stars simply because of its relatively healthy ingredient list; I'd otherwise give it only one star."
"I love this coffee.  I have used Folgers Coffee for many years but this one ""Black Silk"" is the best yet."
"Can not be beat. They are simply addictive. Cheesy, spicy crunchy<br />Our family can not stop eating them You have to order these"
"We love this whole wheat pasta. When my husband was diagnoses with diabetes last year we decided to go with whole wheat pasta, he loves pasta but the type made from refined white flour was really messing up his blood sugar. I had a really hard time finding whole wheat orzo in the local stores, so we tried this product and it's perfect and so convenient to get recurring orders of it as well! Thank you RiceSelect & Amazon!"
"It fit really well, makes me look slim and for the price its great! Although, you will have to hand wash them if you want them to look like new everytime."
"These pretzels have a good cinnamon taste and are really crunchy. They are a satisfying ""good for you"" snack as you can nibble on them for quite a while. Also have no trans fats or artificial flavors. Will purchase again!"
"My little dog has allergies; but I recently read, where sweet potato products<br />are digested easily and rarely cause problems to such an animal. So, I decided<br />to try these.  Honestly, if I offer him two or more different treats at once;<br />he chooses this one FIRST EVERY TIME !!  And NO stomach or bowel problems.<br />I'll be buying these again & AGAIN !!"
What can I say? They're curiously strong 8-) Nice to get the flavor I like in a multipack as they don't sell them here in Afghanistan.
This product is a good tea substitute for someone watching the calories and cutting out sugar in their diet. Taste is close enough to brewed tea if you can give up the real satisfying taste of sugar in fresh brewed. I bought these mainly because the local grocery stores stopped carrying the tea flavor of Crystal Light. I'm not a fan of the peach taste but it is better than the lemon flavored.
"But I'll give it a shot.  Wow.  So far I have only tried (and intend to try) the Key Lime Pie and the Mint Chocolate Chip but they are both amazing.  They key lime pie is incredibly tart and delicious but unfortunately the flavor only lasts about 10 seconds.  The Mint Chocolate Chip is also incredible and the flavor seems to last much longer (or at least, the dulled post-flavor gum is more appealing).  In any event, even for 5 seconds of flavor these gums are a gem.  Great idea by Wrigley."
"Another great idea for a dog toy, but my medium-sized dog cracked the yellow covers in less than 5 min. The plastic shattered. She will never see those little yellow covers again. I might find a way to cover the food wells with something else, now that I'm stuck with this toy. My dog is not a chewer, and this toy did not stand up."
All my fault. I thought this would be a carton of 3 boxes of cereal.  Instead it was 1 box of cereal for 12.99. Who sells cereal for this price plus $8.00 shipping ? I feel stupid!  Buyer Beware!
Before I discover this mix on Amazon I always bought it in Whole Food Store.<br />I like this mix and when I am doing the pancakes they came very delicious and fluffy.<br />Just one small secret: Try to add the Seltzer water instead of regular one.
"Since learning my husband has celiac disease, he hasn't been able to eat pizza with us on homemade pizza nights. It used to be a treat. So I was excited when I first tried the bread mix thinking he could enjoy pizza again. However, the dough never seems to bake throughout; it always turns out gummy. We've tried letting it rise even longer than the hour recommended, even that didn't help. I still have a few bags left so I'm going to try something other than pizza."
I got these for a 3 month old 4 lb Havanese puppy because her breeder had given us one (I thought) that has lasted a couple of weeks.  I just gave her the puppy chew and I was shocked when she had a 1 inch piece in her mouth--which I quickly took away as a choking hazard--in less than 10 minutes.  I now believe what the breeder had given me was something else that looks just like these puppy chews.  Maybe it was an edible dog chew.  This chew is not long-lasting by any stretch of the imagination!  I should add that my puppy really enjoyed it for the 10 minutes.
"this item came exactly as described and shipped on time which is very important for Christmas!!  Thanks for a reliable, easy shopping experience."
I really did not think my picky a** dogs would eat them. I tossed the treats to them and waited for the sniff of dis approval. Waiting...waiting.. chomp chomp and they are gone to another room to enjoy the treat in peace. Two dogs give them a paws up.
My dog refused to eat any of these.  I had to give them away.  Beware if your dog is picky.
"Buyer Beware Please! This sweetener is not for everybody.  Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!"
My 10 month old took one bite made a face and refused the rest. She eats anything. I tried it and so did my husband. It tasted like potting soil and has a very bitter after taste. I feel like some of the veggies are not cooked long enough and thats why its bitter.
This is a favorite in the office and in my house. We burn through this coffee. I've tried a few of the other Wolfgang coffees and this one is by far the best. I've seen better prices for this at a lot of other places. This is an excellent coffee to start your day with.
"LOVE this product. The best one is the Peppermint & the Marzipan by far. They arrived neatly packaged. Not melted, thankfully. and oh so good!. I will be coming back for more"
"THIS COFFEE IS REALLY DELICIOUS.A COOL LATIN FLAVOR.EXCELLENT.5 STARS I GIVE TO THIS COFFEE.I HOPE AMAZON NEVER GET RID OF IT BECAUSE THIS COFFEE IS REALLY HARD TO FIND IN MY LOCAL SUPERMARKETS.AND I HPE ALWAYS THEY GOT THE SAME LOW PRICE FOR 6 PACKETS.THE LESS I GET THIS COFFEE BAGS IS $2.49 PER PACKET.GOOD DEAL,AMAZON.HURRAY FOR YOU."
"We enjoy A Taste of Tai's Peanut Noodles... they rock.  That peanutty flavor...mmm... so we decided to try these... um, Ginger, not so much. Nothing really distinguishes these from any other noodle flavor, and the ginger is a bit overpowering.<br /><br />Take this review in stride though, if you're a Ginger lover (and I'm not talking Gilligan's Island here), then these may be right up your alley.  Just a bit outside for me, though (if I may mix my metaphors)."
"Thought I'd try these because it's a good price, but the chocolate flavor is not that good. And the sucralose taste is very strong. I like the Swiss Miss Hot Chocolate ones better, even though those have sucralose too, you can't really taste it."
"I love cherry soda, but this product is the best cherry soda  that I have ever tasted.  Sweet and slightly tart at one and the same time.  Try it once, and you will be hooked for good."
A hands down favorite of my dogs. Glucosamine & Chrondrotin is a favorite recommendation from my vets. No better way to get it than in a tasty chewy (not hard) treat.
"It sure would be nice if they stated ANYWHERE in the description of this coffee that it is flavored.  I love the Bed and Breakfast coffee, it's just plain coffee, so I was surprised when I received the Jamaica coffee and it was flavored.  YUCK!"
"This is the best dog food!  I have seven dogs, three over the age of 14 and they are as spry and energetic as dogs half their age.  We went grain-free years ago after one of our dogs got cancer.  I began reading about excess carbohydrates and how BAD they are for our dogs (and us)...Initially we used EVO because it was great and it was the only grain-free availble.  We were very happy with it until the price went through the roof!  We tried several different grain-free food over the next year or so.  Some the dogs just didn't like.  Some aggravated my Lhasa Apso's allergies.  A couple of my dogs are susceptible to yeast infections and the EVO had curtailed that problem but it came back with other foods.  Finally we tried Earthborn's Grain-Free line and VOILA!  They love it! The price is right, no allergies or infections...everyone is healthy and happy!This is the best food around and the price is right."
"Earlier this year, a colleague pointed out that I live right next to an illy.  Hearing that they have good coffee, I went and found my latte to be marvelous, better than anything at Starbucks or Caribou coffee.  Since then, I gone in on numerous occasions and had their full range of drinks, including their drip coffee.  Thinking that I could save some money, I bought this coffee to make myself a fresh cup in the morning.  I was careful to get the right grind size for my french press.  My homemade coffee does not compare with the illy's made coffee.  I dunno if they use fresher beans or what, but I found this coffee from Amazon to be dull, flavorless and definitely not worth the $26 price.  I only used 1/2 of the canister before switching over to Peets.  If you're in the mood for illy's, you should just go to their cafe to get a cup, otherwise brew something else at home."
"When I saw the mint iced tea powder on the website, I thought I would like it. But when  I received it and tried one, I was very disappointed. It was the green tea and not sweet at all. The flavor was nothing at all like an iced tea like I was expecting. I had to add sugar to it to get a flavor that I like to be similar to regular iced tea. I don't even know if I'll be using the others I had received. Sorry about this, but you did ask for my review on this."
"Wish they were stocked in stores but glad to be able to find them online. Not only food for white trash, they are low carb and make the perfect snack food. The aroma from the microwave during the cooking process is heavenly. Be sure to shake the bag per package direction. A must for the pork rind addict. After you try these, you will never go back to prepackaged rinds."
I wanted this for the omega 3's but my daughter wouldn't eat this.  It really smells and looks like cat food.
"What a great deal!  To try to buy these in the store they are over $7 each.  Through Amazon, I bought the 6-pack and they came out to about $5 each plus I hit the $25 mark and Amazon gave me free s&h  -  Always looking for a great deal through Amazon."
"She didn't like slicked food, or bits, etc. unless I chopped them more. The pate is perfect consistancy tho I still have to add a little hot water and make it a bit more soupy. I don't know if she has bad teeth or just wants her food the temperature of a dead critter. However she will eat any of the pates and thats a miracle."
"I thought that this would be the perfect toy for my 100 lb lab who destroys Kongs in about 3 days. But, to my surprise, he was interested in it for all of about 5 min. He chewed the rope part for a little bit but has not touched it since."
"I fed this to my three cats. Within a month one of them began getting sick, throwing up his food once a day then every meal. Eventually he began throwing up blood and was passing it from his bottom. We thought he was going to die, these symptoms all happened over a few days time.<br />We took him to the vet, they ran tons of tests found nothing wrong and gave him a hydration IV and sent him home with instructions for a diet of puree chicken and rice. Days later we gave him a little bit of the dry cat food with his special food. Hours later he was terribly sick again. It was then that we realized the food made him this deathly ill!<br />DO NOT BUY GOODLIFE it almost killed our cat!"
"I almost didn't order these because of the bad review. . .only one can was really dented, and I opened that first.  No damage at all to the contents, and the flavor wasn't salty.  The apricots are tangy, the skin is a bit leathery just like fresh apricots, and the cans are quite full, not just juice with a few fruits floating around.  I was very happy with the product and would order again.  These are delicious for a quick dessert right out of the fridge, but would make a nice cobbler, too."
"These had been my dog's favorite treats. BUT when she developed vomiting and diarrhea, the vet strongly suggested that I reconsider these treats because, quote, they have been tied to some serious health problems. She asked, are these the ones made in China?  I said yes, and she said she wouldn't take the chance.  I just threw the last (full) bag into the garbage. Please don't take a chance with your pup!"
"I had high hopes when I purchased this produce, shipping was amazingly fast and I've tried it a few times. I don't enjoy the taste, and since I don't sweeten my tea, it wasn't that great, and it did nothing for my sinuses. Will not purchase again but I do recommend the seller."
"Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area. In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think I'm lying. So I bought 10lbs... : ) These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick, but nothing to strong. I love grape flavored candy/soda and these are pretty good. There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion, but these are well worth it for the price. I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink. The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles, and the gummy bears are awesome frozen. They are delicious!"
"We really like the Happy Bellies cereal, but this time, it came at a price! It arrived smelling like cigarette smoke! I won't even feed it to my baby! The box smelled horrible, and I just figured it was the delivery driver.  Then when I opened it up, the canisters smelled too.  I don't think this is standard practice-as we've ordered the cereal in the past with no problems."
And they are DRASTICALLY lower in quality.  Do a brief search on the equivalent of the USDA or Dept of Animal Welfare in China.  Guess what?  No existo.  DO NOT BUY.
"These are a great alternative to your usual ""par-for-the-course"" snacks as well as traditional, bagged pork rinds. I had the same issues with some of the others who've bought them in that finding out how long to microwave them with your particular microwave is a trial and error process on the first bag or two. On my first attempt, they ""fluffed-up"" fine, but I ended up microwaving them too long and some of them started to scorch (leaving a bad burnt smell, though not quite as bad as popcorn when the same thing happens). Spreading them out inside the bag before you start to microwave them is probably the single most important thing you can do. It's a little tricky, but you can get them to move around a bit with minimal effort. If you just throw the bag in the microwave as if it's popcorn, you won't get a quality product, but if you take the time to spread them out (as stated on the bag) and then watch the bag until it stops expanding (again, stated on the bag), they're quite good.<br /><br />Once you get the hang of it, the Bacon Curls are pretty delicious, especially paired with a beer or two (something pale and drinkable, from a ""yard work"" kind of beer to something like an IPA). The curls/rinds are light and fluffy, but very crunchy (surprisingly so, I was halfway expecting there to be some kind of greasy sogginess, but there isn't). They're on the salty side, but again, with the beer, that's a good thing. I like how they come out of the package sizzling and popping a bit, warm (not hot) and delicious. If you already like pork rinds, then this is almost a no brainer, as this is the same thing, only better (fresh, warm, delicious and with less fat)."
"my german shepherd goes crazy for these things. i have no idea why he likes them so much. his breath is always pretty good, so i guess these work well. good deal for the scheduled delivery option."
"Long story short - these are very tasty. We have purchased a number of flavors from this brand, this is my favorite.<br /><br />BUT... as noted by another reviewer - these contain MSG in the form of ""Yeast Extract"".<br /><br />It has become a popular means of hiding MSG lately by calling it different things, as a person who now finds himself having to use more caution in what I consume I find the whole process of hiding in plain site very bothersome.<br /><br />Also, the bag is not very large, but half of it is air. This may well help in shipping, but when paying a premium price for 'organic' it just seems more deceptive."
"Not the best I've ever had, but good. The best I've had was expensive and from an English company (I can't remember the name). But this is better than the movie kind. They're not quite as moist and rich as the best ones I've tried."
"We drink a lot of tea... from all over the world! By far this is the worst tasting tea we have had... I purchased this based on reviews and because this is organic. When compared to st dalfour organic tea... this tastes like Lipton caffeine free tea from Costco! I HAVE always gone with reviews before buying anything online, but this particular tea is no good, At ALL. And Costco returns is better than amazon for so much of something so bad!"
"In the past I've bought these from a local grocery store and they were soft, chewy, moist, and delicious. unfortunately the batch I just received from Amazon were dried out, crunchy, and stale.  wondering if the boxes sold here are expired overstock.  buyer beware - food items can not be returned.  am hesitant to try again..."
"It was a sad day when my elderly Maltese quit chomping regular greenies. . . He loved the taste, but he enjoys softer food, toys & treats now that he's older.  Senior Greenies saved the day!  He loves the taste.  I cut them into tiny slices so one treat lasts longer.  Keeping an older dog's teeth clean can be a challenge, especially if they aren't able to eat really crunchy food or gnaw on rawhides or bones.  Senior Greenies can help!"
I received the Molasses before the expected due date.  The unsulfured blackstrap molasses was the only ingredient (no preservatives) on the label.  It is an excelent product for brown sugar creation or baking.  I also mix a teaspoon with a glass of water for the mineral suppliments.
"Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs.  They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training.  (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency.  It comes chopped/cubed.  It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it.  The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical.  I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat.....  not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber.....  not more than 3%<br />-Moisture.....  not more than 6%"
"the bag is made of plastic which is not compostable. I wanted to give this tea a higher grade especially after reading about Lipton's commitment to sustainable growing and certification by the RainForest Alliance, but then they blew it with a plastic bag. Since tea is the ultimate soil enhancer, I regularly discard my used tea leaves on house plants and then outdoor plants and pots (even in the dead of winter awaiting spring). I've cancelled my Subscribe & Save and will return to loose teas especially the Rishi and Octavia organic white flavored teas and Celestial Seasonings in a paper bag."
"This is some of the worst stuff I've ever tried to drink. It's even worse than that awful stuff that comes out of those machines where the cup drops down and fills it. I tried it on the various cup size settings with my Keurig machine and it just goes from bad to horrible when going from the larger size to the smallest.<br /><br />It's a complete waste of money.<br /><br />I just tried another brand that's similar and it's no good either. If you like chocolate water, buy these. If you have it in mind that you are buying ""Hot Chocolate"" with a milky or creamy flavor... that's not what this stuff is.<br /><br />Yuck!"
It's a shame to use so much corn syrup for babies! I'm very disappointed when I noticed that. The same kind sold in China is even better.
"I was excited to see that Amazon is selling 100% Kopi Luwak. However, these beans were a huge disappointment because they had no aroma and flavor at all. I'm guessing that they sent stale beans because there was no roast date printed on the bag."
"the lime flavor is too much, didnt think it would be so strong. its ok but there are much better flavors to be had. would not buy again."
"Agave Nectar is the only sweetner we use in our household. If you haven't tried it yet, you should."
"I love dried peaches and normally respect the SunMaid brand. As such, I thought these were a bargain ($12 for a 6-pack). Unfortunately, they have a pungent smell that is kind of funky and turns me off. They are edible, but I think I'll give away my 4 unopened packs to the local food bank rather than eating them."
My nine year old Dingo used to get smelly after a month on IAMS.  It's been three months since his last bath (I just brush him) and no smell with Canidae!  My 6mo old Chihuahua was on IAMS for puppies but kept sneeking the Canidae from my Dingo.  So now he eats it too.  They scaf it down like crazy.  Buzz the Dingo's weight has improved without starving him.  This is the best dog food.  The price is good here although I buy it at the pet store.
"My wife like these better that the Swedish version, Wasa, as she finds the taste better and likes the thinness of the product.  We will buy again."
I drink one of these every day and it seems to have improved my health noticeably. There is variety of flavors but I tend to prefer Tangerine.
"I don't expect great hot chocolate from a k-cup, but it should at least taste like there's some cocoa in it. I can't believe how bad this stuff tastes. I tried it 3 times, and then threw the rest away."
"I personally did not care for the coffee, too mild for me and a little ""nutty"" flavor in it.  I will stick with Tully's Kona and House blends, also Emeril's Big Easy bold."
"The price on these fell to a $1, so I bought 20 of them.  I'm pretty sure they lost money on that deal.  I was raised the next day.  Anyway, the product is great.  Dogs love them.  But I'm pretty sure they'd love stale popcorn too.. hmmm.."
"I initially bought this for my hair (crazy I know)after seeing it on a hair forum.  When it arrived, I chickened out and used it for cooking.  I am from Haiti and I use this on almost everything.  It has a slight nutty taste, easy to use."
"Can I give 0 stars?  This new recipe is so bad that I thought the package expired.  It was  not until I see it says ""New Recipe"" Who approves this crap?  It is terrible.. I had been eating this since I was a kid  (in my 30s now) and no way will I ever eat it again."
My dogs absolutely love greenies and any time I can save money buying them that's a plus.  They are twice the price at any pet or grocery store.
"Please be aware that although dogs absolutely LOVE these treats, that they may have caused a recent unexplainable illness in our 9 month old Mastiff pup. He was getting 1 or 2 a day of these chicken jerky's for about a week and then suddenly became very lethargic, along with vomiting, diarrhea, and had no appetite ""except"" he would eat only these treats and drink water. Vet thinks he'll recover OK, but advised us to stop feeding them to our dogs. These are still ""Made in China"" and in 2007 reports had shown that dogs were getting sick from these and other brands, and there are still reported cases today. Just be careful and watch your pets closely if you are feeding them these. We will no longer feed these to any of our dogs, ever. Wish Dogswell would manufacturer these in the USA again."
"We bought this to replace our Cafe Escapes Dark Chocolate Cocoa.  They are less expensive- but you get what you pay for.  This cocoa is watery brown sugar water with an aftertaste.  I do not recommend it.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005K4Q1T0"">Grove Square Hot Cocoa Cups, Dark,Single Serve Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a>"
I bought these at my local grocery store. I wish I would have read the review on here first. The positive is they do hold together well and look like a muffin. The negative is they are so bitter. I could barely finish my half. I just recently found out I have Celiac Disease  so I cant have gluten. I have never tried a gluten free muffin mix before so I can not compare it to any others. I have tried the Betty Crocker Gluten Free brownie mix and that is wonderful. So I do believe there would be a good muffin mix out there.
"I LOVE the Blue Diamond Butter Toffee and The Chocolate.  This is my first try with the Cinnamon and they are fabulous!  I eat and live low carb and eat a lot of nuts...the flavored Blue Diamond Almonds are hard to find, so I am happy to find them on Amazon.  Even better to have them delivered to my door FAST & FREE!  Thanks Amazon and Blue Diamond!"
My dogs are nuts for the Dogswell Happy Hips dried chicekn breasts but they are made in China so I hardly ever give them to my dogs.I wish the company would have them manufactured elsewhere.
I use Agave Nectar for my Margaritas so I have this on 'Subscribe and Save' which is a great option. It comes to me automatically just when I need it at a discounted price. It was damaged only one time out of 4 shipments and it was re-shipped in time for my needs. You can't beat this price anywhere. Love it!
These really whiten their teeth.<br />And the dogs love them.  Works great for my big dog.<br />The price is why they only get 4 stars.
My mother uses it when making the best twice baked sweet potatos:) It's also perfect on those pancakes or waffles!!!!!
Very good price for these Green Mountain K-Cups. They are very convienient and the flavor is great. SHipment was quick and easy.
"I first found out about Jaffa Cakes from the popular YouTube show, the Yogscast. I wanted to try them myself, so I ordered these because they were the cheapest option available. They shipped quickly, and when they arrived, they were in great condition. I order the product from this seller frequently. The Jaffa cakes themselves were delicious. Would definitely order again. Delicious!"
"I loved the Foods Alive garlic and onion flavor flax crackers.  When I finished my entire order of 6 bags, I decided to try the Mustard flavor since I love all mustards on almost everything.  Well...I just finished my first bag of it last night and it's ok - Organic, Crisp & fresh for sure.  But doesn't compare to the strong & powerful garlic & onion flavor.  Maybe the mustard is too mild on my palate.  But I just thought the flavor was too bland for my taste.<br /><br />If you like a mild mustard & always wanted to try organic flax crackers made with pure ingredients & no fillers or chemicals, then this flavor is for you and I would recommend that you try it."
These cookies are amazing. They taste as good as if not better than the original brands. I only wish local stores would catch on and carry this cookie.
"As advertised this product puts only a small amount of carbonation in the drink.  The taste is similar to Orangina but with a much more pronounced juice taste and mouth  feel.  It actually leaves a thick taste in your mouth similar to when you drink orange juice from concentrate.  It is a bit high in sugar but at least it is natural fructose sugar from the fruits (again, similar to real orange juice) as there are no added sugars.  Certainly not a calories conscience drink but not bad.  I do think the can is way too small but then again any more and the sugars and calories really soar."
I very much enjoy the microwave pork rinds. Scheduled deliveries make things simple and convenient.
"I wouldn't call these almonds sweet, but they do have just the right hint of sweet flavor that the almond is elevated and feels like a treat.  The taste and texture of almonds doesn't particularly appeal to me, but they're such a healthy snack that I'm glad to find this delicious option.  Also, the small container is the perfect size to have on your desk or keep in the car, or use as stocking stuffers like I plan to do for a couple of my healthy eating conscious friends!"
"This coffee was deep and rich, and did not have a bitter taste too it.  I did have to use a little more than what was recommended to get it the way I drink coffee.. but coffee is a personal thing everyone has their desired strength.  The coffee was fresh upon opening but began to go down hill really quick as far as aroma and taste goes, so invest in a good air tight container.  I liked this coffee, but it I could go on in the morning if I did not have it."
"I recently purchased this on sale at my local grocery store... now I know why it was on sale!<br /><br />This is not a fluffy, creamy white frosting you'd expect to find when opening the jar. Now, I wasn't expecting it to be just like Betty Crocker, but it was pretty bad. Like others said, it is a gluey/tacky mess that would completely ruin a cake if you tried to spread it on.  It reminds me of taffy that hasn't quite hit the right stage in the candy making process.  The taste isn't that great either, and it's sickeningly sweet (even for frosting).  The only thing it might be used for is a frosting for cinnamon buns?  I still don't think it would be the right consistency..."
The plant arrived in great condition ... fully green and with about five or six heads in the clear box that can serve as a terrarium.  Will give it our best shot on keeping it up and running!  This was in much better shape than the venus flytrap plants at our local big-box do-it-yourself in their garden area.
"First, I'm not a big fan of dark chocolate. I'm not really a huge chocolate fan in general - but I've preferred milk chocolate over dark. This chocolate is does not taste anything like other dark chocolates. I find the flavor robust, but in a subdued way (a contradiction, I know). It is hard to describe, but this is one of the best chocolates I've tasted. It has a unique grainy texture that is fabulous. The price (currently $5.99 here at Amazon) is very high though. I pay about 4.59 at a local grocery store (and no shipping charges). I buy at least one per week to feed my addiction."
"I bought two of these for my Pug puppies.  Wasn't sure if first if they would get the hang of it but it took no time at all.  Instead of the treats they suggest (which could be made of anything and could have too many calories), I fill these with Cheerio's (or some frozen sliced carrrots or peas) and a few larger milkbones and they go nuts.  The larger milkbones are added just to make it a little tougher.  It's a great learning toy or busy toy - hence the name.  All I have to ask my little Puggies is, ""do you want your bottle"" and that's all they need.  We couldn't live without it.  Oh and I've had ours for probably a year and a half and we're not even close to needing to replace them."
Rishi is the finest quality tea you can imagine! This Earl Grey explodes with satisfying aroma and flavor! Don't say you don't like tea until you try Rishi!
"As a professional potato chip muncher, I see these as thee very BEST on the market. Rich taste and flavor!! Almost impossible not to finish the entire bag.The true meaning of decadence!"
"I am so happy that Bisquick came out with a gluten free version!  We've tried so many other brands of pancake and waffle mix, and hands down, Bisquick is the BEST!  We just made waffles this morning, and both my husband and I were floored at how good they were!  The outside was crisp and the inside was soft.  With that said, it's not that great for pancakes or coffeecake."
"I spent days trying to find decent mango puree in order to make mango shakes, and since I'm a health nut, I try to control my sugar intake. Every mango puree I look at is full of sugar, and this brand is no different. 21 grams of sugar per serving, and an amazing 168 grams for the entire can. An average can of soda contains 45 grams, for comparison. I know they make unsweetened mango puree, but I can't find it.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a decent enough product if you don't care about unnecessary sugar intake. Nice and creamy, good product from good fruit. Very sweet, but these manufacturers don't understand that you don't need to add so much sugar to a naturally sweet fruit! There IS a market for unsweetened fruit, guys."
The cookies tasted too much like baby food prunes to be any good.  Also they included directions to freeze them when they arrived to keep them from spoiling.  I would never buy these again.
"I'm pretty sure a lot of us have tried the ""Chef's"" spaghetti, ravioli, etc.  These little microwaveable bowls make it so easy to have lunch, a snack, or dinner.  It's not only great for kids but it's good for adults, too.<br /><br />It's nice to have a variety on hand when someone gets the ""munchies"" and doesn't have a lot of time to cook.  It's not gourmet by any means but definitely satisfies the appetite for a little Italian food......quick and easy."
This chili is great tasting and very filling. One can will easily feed 2 people. It is a medium spicy tasting chili but you can always up the heat if you want with a shot of hot sauce and more spices.<br />It is the best tasting vegetarian canned chili i have tried and i highly recommend.<br />Serve it with some nice crusty bread and you got yourself a whole meal.
"I like the taste of this drink.  It has a nice fruity taste, that doesn't leave an aftertaste.  I will probably order some."
"We discovered this salsa on vacation last year. I'm SO excited to find it here on Amazon, so we can get it again. It's absolutely delicious, and it doesn't have any chemical ingredients, something we ALWAYS look for! Definitely worth every penny!"
purchased them for as a special gift for a boat christening.  They REALLY enjoyed and appreciated receiving this unusual gift.  Received the item in good shape and quickly.  very pleased with everything. Will order from them again...
"So I bought this pomegranate molasses to make Fattoush, the delicious middle eastern salad of greens, cukes, tomatoes and torn up bits of fried, leftover pita bread.  Wowee, Fattoush is now my favorite salad, I've eaten so often lately that the tart lemon-y dressing has made the corners of my mouth turn a bit pinkish and raw, youch. I tend to do that, find a food I really like, then eat it so much I almost make myself sick on it.<br /><br />Anyways, the Fattoush salad dressing, with it's complex blend of Sumac, olive oil and various herbs and spices required one half teaspoon of pomegranate molasses.  I was lucky enough to find it at a Russian grocery store (YAY!).  But the store is far away and so I had to look around online to buy more, thank God for Amazon.<br /><br />Now, granted, my bottle will likely last years if all I do with it is make Fattoush, one goopy half teaspon at a time, so I've used it in a few other things.  I added a teaspoon to a Lemon Chicken Marinade, a tiny glob to a bowl of greek yogurt (had to add honey too cuz it was sour!),  a tiny amount added to Christmas Salmon cream cheese log, I used it in Fesenjen, a persian stew of chicken and walnuts, I used a few tablespoons of the sticky stuff in a garlicky barbecue sauce and it was the best barbecue ever.<br /><br />Just don't do what I did and try to replace the molasses in molasses cookies with pomegranate molasses, what a horrible mess, the cookies looked normal, slightly lighter than normal, but the smell!  And the taste!  Ewwww!"
This is a very refreshing carbonated juice drink with no aftertaste.  I love the flavor and the fact that there is no added sugar.  It's more subtle than orange so really kills a thirst.  The size is perfect for times when you don't really want a 12 ounce drink.
"The salt is included with the oil for this popcorn and it is extremely salty.  I have a high salt tolerance so unless you like salt more than popcorn, beware."
"I've very glad that Amazon and other companies are making more English foods available in the U.S. McVities make a high quality product and slightly a bit different than many of the similar products sold here. The years the I spent in England McVities was my favorite brand of biscuits (cookies).<br />Through some Amazon.com deals you can get a good price, but shop carefully, not all prices on Amazon.com are the best. But if it says McVities, it should be good.  While you're at it get some PG Tips Tea bags, now you've got a great way to relax."
"These chicken strips (and most others like them) are priced so low they are hard to resist. My dogs love them of course and for dogs who tolerate chicken, they should be excellent treats. However, I do not trust pet foods sourced from China. Most of you should remember the melamine disaster of several years ago that killed and permanantly injured over ten thousand pets. It remains almost impossible to determine the conditions under which chinese food products are produced and manufactured. The rumors in the veterinary world (I am a DVM)are that the majority of the chickens used in these cheap products are dead before processing. No one has any clue what, if any, adulterants are added. Many brands are irradiated (if this matters to you). Overall, I recommend purchasing pet food products that the manufacturer guarantees are made 100% from US grown and processed ingredients."
We had to move to formula when our baby was 8 weeks. We have found Enfamil Premium to mix easier than the regular Enfamil Lipil. Our baby has had no digestive issues from the formula. I love getting it in bulk from Amazon as it saves the weekly trip to the store for formula. The price (with free shipping) is comparable with local grocery stores in the Austin Area.
This coffee is good with a chocolate taste and a hint of raspberry.  I think anyone that loves a chocolate taste would enjoy this one.
"I recieved this oil last week and it is rancid. It smells and tastes like rotten tomatos or avacados and there is no way I could eat this on any type of salad. Both cans arrived in perfect condition and neither are near the expiration date on the bottle. I recommend purchasing from a local retailer so it can be taken back if its rancid. Its too much of a gamble buying from Amazon when you cannot return food items. Lesson learned.<br /><br />UPDATE 04/05/2011: After reading so many reviews about how good this product was I contacted La Tourangelle through their email system and told them about the situation and asked how this avocado oil was supposed to taste. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to taste the way it did or not. I didn't ask for replacements or anything because I know a lot of companies will not back their product if sold by Amazon. That is not the case with La Tourangelle. I was contacted by Diane through email about a week later asking for the batch numbers. I gave them and didn't hear anything back, until today. About an hour ago UPS delivered a box that contained two large cans of oil; one can of Avocado oil and one can of Hazelnut oil. I was so surprised because I didn't even remember giving them my address, but now recall it was required on their email submission form. At any rate La Tourangelle went above and beyond and they will be getting my business in the future, but only in a B&M store or through their website. That is the only place I can recommend anyone buy these products because Amazon will not take back food items.<br /><br />As far as the oil, the new Avocado oil tastes like real Avocados with no rancid taste or smell and the Hazelnut is out of this world. I plan to try them all out now, from the La Tourangelle website. Companies that go above and beyond will always get my business because they actually care about their product. Thank you La Tourangelle!"
"My Akita mix pup then, and even now as an adult does not like this toy.  There are much better treat dispensers on the market, like ""Bob a lot.""<br />The purple dispenser is a large neoprene container similar to a water bottle for hiking.  My dog was afraid of the toy until I helped him get some of the treats out with the rubber attachment that slides in and out of the bottle.  He had no interest in trying to get them out on his own and still doesn't.<br />I have a 4 month old lab pup and she has no interest either.<br />I think it's a poor design."
my dog was too small to move the covers with her mouth or paws- I don't recommend for any dog under 20 lbs!
"I invited guests over for dinner and made 8 large pork chops in the oven using the packet. I added a few panko bread crumbs and I added salt, pepper, parsley, garlic salt and onion salt for more flavor. I put the pork chops in the oven and cooked them for nearly an hour and they came out moist and flavorful and there were no leftovers. The guests said they loved them and I even taught my daughter how to use the packet so she could make them too one day. I would buy these and use the chicken version too. I love that baking is healthier and is less fuss than frying too."
"I received the package early, which was great. The candy packaging looked fine but I didn't discover the problem until I opened the bag. Half the bag of Peanut M&M's was cracked! I was really embarrassed to share them with anybody because the entire bagful was dusted with M&M debris. Not happy with this purchase at all."
"We started our son on solids when he was six months. The first ""food"" we introduced was rice cereal as recommended by our pediatrician. We tried every day for 2 weeks to feed my son rice cereal and then oatmeal cereal but he hated both! He'd refuse the food by turning away and keeping his mouth tightly shut. I was at my wits end and gave him a break because I knew I had to be patient. I was never a huge fan of the idea of feeding my son rice cereal so I went searching for something that was convenient and came in small portions. I didn't want to feed my son the traditional baby food from a jar due to the risk of BPA found in the jar lids. Luckily, I found NurturMe! My son loved it from the start.  We started with the peas and then worked our way through the apple, squash, and sweet potato.<br /><br />Here is what I love about NuturMe Baby Food:<br /><br />CONVENIENCE. The food comes in BPA-FREE paper pouches that are easy to travel with. They contain the same amount of food as a 2.5oz jar of baby food. When we first started my son on solids he ate 1/2 pouch at each feeding. We saved the rest in the fridge and fed the the rest at his second feeding. It states on the packaging that they can last 2-3 days refrigerated. I personally only trust 24 hours if prepared with formula and 2-3 days if made with water. This is because it states on the formula can that prepared formula should be discarded after 24 hours. If I still breastfed, I would trust breastmilk to last 2-3 days as well.<br /><br />TASTE. Although the food is quick dried, it tastes fresh! The peas actually taste like peas and they are actually bright green, like they should be. I've tried the foods myself before I first fed them to my son and they passed my taste test! I also love that the baby food is organic. This is very important to me that everything my son eats is free of pesticides. I am conscious about what I eat, it shouldn't be any different for my son.<br /><br />MIX & MATCH. I love that you can mix and match the baby foods together to make new flavor profiles for the baby. I am all about introducing new foods to my baby and this is the perfect way to do it! Another great idea is to add juice to the baby food once your baby is 8+ months. When my son gets older I am going to try out adding pomegranate juice to the apple variety. I don't plan of giving my son juice to drink so this is a great way to introduce him to the flavor of pomegranate.<br /><br />ECO-FRIENDLY. The packaging to completely recyclable and doesn't take of the space that canned baby food does. That means a smaller carbon footprint! In addition, the packaging is BPA-FREE. I emailed the company and asked them before I purchased the product on Amazon.<br /><br />Here is the only issue I have with NurturMe:<br /><br />CONSISTENCY. I noticed that it can be difficult to mix the baby food together to get the desired consistency. For instance, the apple was really clumpy and hard before I added the water and I had a difficult time getting all of the clumps out. Its similar to mixing formula -- you have to take extra care! My remedy for this was to use a handheld milk frother and from then on I got the perfect consistency with no clumps! I've also noticed that the peas have a little bit of a grainy texture but my son doesn't seem to mind.<br /><br />I am definitely happy with NuturMe baby food. I think it is a quick and convenient way to serve my baby organic baby food for when we are on the go! It is the best alternative I have found to homemade baby food."
Pamela's gluten-free bread is THE best!  It is miles ahead of other gluten-free brands.  The bread is delicious and moist.  We use a bread maker and add in raisins or cranberries to enhance the enjoyablity of the bread.  It is also excellent toasted.
"When a friend of mine recommended I tried Chia Seeds I though she was crazy, I mean they're Chia Seeds... enough said. Anyway, I tried them because I'll try just about anything if someone tells me it's good for me and I'll like it, and as it turns out it is both of those things. These little seeds are about the size of sesame seeds, maybe a little smaller, and have a very mild nutty taste. They can be added to just about anything and are packed with omega fats, fiber and a little protein. They've got fat, but not the bad french fries and cheeseburger kind, the good kind that your body uses to keep your heart and everything else healthy. And by the way, these don't have to be ground or chewed up (like flax) in order for your body to get all the goodies from them, you can just eat them the way they are."
Very dissapointed in shipping. This is the second time I have ordered and all the cans are dented
"Of all the K-Cups I have purchased so far, I like this French Roast the best. It has a really bold taste even used with the large-cup button. I like other coffee selections too, but this one really stands out.<br /><br />I consider myself an early adapter and the Keurig coffee machine is one of my best purchases. Although the coffee is somewhat expensive at $.40-.50 a cup, there is no waste, no pot cleanup, and, best of all, great coffee. I usually get up earlier than the rest of the household and can have my great coffee almost instantly without making a full pot that can go sour before all being drank.<br /><br />I notice that regular retailers such as Target and grocery stores are now carrying K-Cups, but buying online costs less and is more convenient. pjs"
"Organic foods are probably most important the first couple of years of life. That is when so much brain development is happening that trying to keep as much pesticides as possible away from your child's developing brain and body is a very worthy goal.<br /><br />Fortunately it is a little easier than it is for a grown up. With our more varied foods and time constraints and on the go, etc. Also no matter how worthy a goal, your child has to eat the food. This is an excellent combination of flavors that I was not always able to find at local stores. And with subscribe and save it is cheaper and delivered to my door.<br /><br />The flavors are vegetable turkey which lists the ingredients as Water, organic carrots, organic apples, organic ground turkey, organic whole barley flour.<br /><br />Sweet potato and chicken: Water, organic sweet potatoes, organic apricot puree, mechanically separated organic chicken, organic brown rice flour.<br /><br />Summer vegetable: Water, organic corn, organic zucchini, organic green beans, organic brown rice, organic carrots, organic garbanzo beans, organic canola oil.<br /><br />Rice and Lentil: Water, organic apples, organic carrots, organic brown rice, organic lentils, organic canola oil<br /><br />There are other Earth Best blends where water is not the number one ingredient. Obviously that somewhat calls into the question the 'value' of this particular Earth's best item. I just found the tomato and carrot one which I have ordered but not received yet.  Also if you put in organic baby food in Amazon search there are some brands with just food in them for example Peter Rabbit organics (have not yet tried it, but might when she is a bit older).<br /><br />Overall though I do recommend this variety pack. Our daughter likes them all and she is getting organic ingredients. And for a decent price, even considering the amount of water in them. The water being first in all 4 is giving me pause as to the overall value and definitely something I will keep in mind as to trying other brands going forward. The ingredient lists are all directly from the Earth Best's website, earthsbest.com,  as I do not have the products in front of my right now."
Saw this soup in the supermarket and bought a can. Opened can. Heated soup. Tasted soup. Dumped soup down drain. Rinsed mouth with mouthwash. Enough said.
I really like the flavor of this one! It has a low acidity but still full of flavor! Now I have to have it every morning and I am having trouble finding another one I like this much.
"I really like this coconut water, but I was surprised that per 17oz box it's the same price at Wegman's.  Probably won't be ordering again unless there's some sort of discount."
"Avoderm has always been near the top of quality dog foods, but what a smell that came out of that bag of dog food...had to throw it away..do not buy until seller chimes in that they have a new batch"
"Didn't realize it was flavored and thought, when I had my first sip, that it tasted like chemicals. F-. Gave it away the next day at work."
"I've been enjoying this tea for years.  This tea is good mornings, afternoons or evenings.  My local store went out of buisiness....Thanks Amazon!  I use a bodum tea press to prepare a pot."
The peas are a BRIGHT fresh looking green color not anything like a store bought peas would be. My son loves all of the flavors. The apples do get clumpy and kind of hard so it's a little harder to mix those up the the other flavors. Over all I LOVE these.
"I have bought k-cups from amazon before and this was the first time that I bought the Van Houtte and am disappointed , not so much in the taste but that many of the cups in this order where defective and would drain all of the coffee grounds into my cup or just soak up the water and not drain at all. I would suggest that people do not buy these."
"I have had Green Mountain coffee before, but had not tried the French Roast.  I am just realizing that there is a taste difference between different manufacturers, even with the same types of roasts.  The Green Mountain French Roast has the flavor I like and was expecting.  The price was reasonable and my order shipped quickly.  My only disappointment was in the shipping packaging.  I knew that I was ordering 2 boxes of K-cups but was surprised to see how big the shipping box was.  There was room for 3 boxes, with the extra space filled with bubble-wrap, which seems wasteful to me.  But on the whole, I am very happy with my coffee!"
I suppose it's about as close as you can get to mass produced (real) egg nog. It is pretty convenient too.
"I ordered three of the trays (being a date nut) and found that two were old or stale. I admit to not checking the out-of-date on the exterior package, but still - dried out fruit.?! The last tray was fresher, but the experience was soured at that point. I'm disappointed."
"I got this for a family member as part of a football themed gift. I like that the basket can be reused. I have had the pasta before, so I know it is good. I don't know how the other items taste."
"In the attempt to make blueberry cake for my brother, I used the WHOLE bottle and STILL didn't have a blueberry cake.  I added about half the bottle to the cake mix (white cake--NOT vanilla), and the other half to the frosting (white frosting--NOT vanilla) and it still only had a HINT of blueberry flavor.  I was completely disappointed in all the time, effort and money spent making it, and it barely tasted blueberry.  I would have thought that using the WHOLE bottle would have made a blueberry flavor.  I guess I will have to see if I can find actual blueberry extract and not blueberry FLAVORED extract.  Will not be wasting my money on this again.  :("
"This product sells for $4.69 in New York City, the Bronx  and in<br />South Jersey (in Shoprite) for $4.69 a can.  Amazon is selling it for over five dollars a can, and you have to buy the case. Get it at the store. The formula is great just amazon has it over priced"
"Makes very good yogurt that is good for you. Plays well with children, does not give the dog gas!! Once made, you can add fruit and enjoy. There, is that enough words?"
"My husband loves these.  They are pretty good.  They are moist so they are not like ""real"" jerky in that sense but otherwise the texture is very similar.  I wish they had a variety that wasn't so sweet but I definitely recommend trying some before getting an entire package - luckily I got to try each of them, which are all good."
"These crackers are made from whole flax seeds so they aren't like your usual chip or cracker.  Some people I've shared them with don't care for them at all, but some loved them.  I am on a raw food diet, and I use them as chips to eat with guacamole or or other raw dips.  Raw meals sometimes take a lot of advance preparation and when you're really hungry, these will fill you up fast!  Just make sure you drink a lot of water and don't eat too many at once.  I personally liked all the flavors.  The onion was just a bit strong for some, but I thought it was ok.  Will definitely be buying again."
"Be warned, the BBQ flavor is terribly addicting. In fact, I'm eating some right now. Local prices hovered around $4.50 a bag (!!!!!) so I ordered them off Amazon for a great price. If only Amazon would ship them one by one a few days apart so I won't eat 4 bags in one sitting.... ;] Go ahead and try them, you won't regret it."
"After seeing this on Oprah I thought I would be good. I was not impressed as it has too much smoke flavoring in it, which takes away from the bacon flavor. Sorry that it came in a 3 jar pack; however, I definitely won't buy it again."
"My 14 month old daughter can not tolerate cows milk or soy. While she was an infant, she had to drink Nutramigen formula and would only drink maybe 4 oz at a time. Once she turned a year old, and I began giving her Meyenberg goat's milk, she began to guzzle it! She loves it so much! She now consistently drinks 8-12 ounces at a time!<br /><br />I mix one can (powdered) at a time, which makes approx. one gallon. We go through about a gallon every 2 days!<br /><br />This milk is such a blessing! We highly recommend it! Amazon has the best price, too. It's so much more convenient and less expensive to purchase it on here and have it delivered to us rather than make countless (and expensive) trips to the health food store."
I love this brand of Dandelion Root tea.  The tea is so good for your health and keeps you regular.  Transaction went smooth like always.  So glad to hear Amazon may soon have home delivery of groceries to my door.  I have some disabilities that require someone to shop for me but I do a lot of it on Amazon.com
"As others have said, this is REALLY MILD in flavor!  The instructions call for 1 packet per 16 oz. of water.  There are 6 packets per box.<br /><br />I decided to give it a try as I am basically lazy and wanted some (unsweetened; unlemoned) iced tea that I could make on a moment's whim.<br /><br />I started with 1 packet per 16 oz of water; then 2 packets per 16 oz of water and got SOME flavor.  Now I'm using 3 packets per 16 oz. of water.  (I placed a fairly large order so I could experiment with it AND have it throughout the fall and winter.)<br /><br />Since I'm using triple the amount of product in order to get some flavor, I will probably not order this item again."
"I love drinking green tea.  It is delicious hot or cold, but being able to take it with me anywhere was key.  So I searched long and hard for an alternative to canned and bottled green tea which can be cumbersome, expensive and hard to come by in most parts of the US.  In the beginning, what I found was either too expensive, had sugar in it (which defeats the purpose of drinking green tea in the first place) or did not get very good reviews.  Then I found this product and quickly ordered it at the great price and free shipping.  I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />The product works as advertised.  It dissolves quickly in cold water making it great to carry anywhere and it tastes great too.  The instructions say to use one packet for 8 ounces of water, but actually it should be used with 16 ounces of water, otherwise it can be too bitter.<br /><br />It not only saves money, but has replaced my canned green tea completely eliminating the number of cans that I need to recycle monthly."
"Great snack on the go.  It tastes like a real treat, even though it seems fairly healthy.  Tasted fresh and wholesome, but also indulgent. I would buy this regardless of its attention to allergy sensitivity."
"My absolute favorite. Very cherry indeed. This is the only jelly bean I enjoy. Guess I will have to order more. Thay lasted no time with the grandkids, lol"
"Everyone of the cans were severely dented and all of the dented sides were carefully placed so could not see them. The cans were shrink-wrapped and packed in plastic air bags, there was no damage to the box they arrived in, so they were dented when packed."
"I have missed Bisquick since I became gluten free and am so happy to see they have gone gluten free. I've only made pancakes so far, but they are wonderful."
"These are some of my favorite bars, but these were old and very tough. I could not find a date on them, but they were obviously old.  I will not order these on-line again."
My wife uses this coffee in our espresso machine to make cappuchinos with cocoa powder and it is great.  She says it has a nice strong coffee flavor but smooth not bitter.  I don't drink coffee but I took some to work for the drip machine there and several of the coffee drinkers love it.
"My cat is 12 years old and very finicky about what she eats...she has never eaten dry food..she will starve before touching dry food. But..mostly she just meows as loud as she can and gets into mischief if she doesn't have what she wants to eat.... She loves this type of cat food, though. I don't know whether it is the cheese she likes, or the over all taste...but she devours it every time....I wish it was smooth instead of strips, as she seems to have trouble chewing it...I wish the grocery stores would stock more of it, as i usually buy for a month at a time..."
"I think I'd call these the most delicious gummis I've ever had.  Good texture, not too ""oily"".  A nice variety of flavors, but you can still eat them by the handful with no problem.<br /><br />I suppose it would be better if there were no corn syrup.  Otherwise, flawless."
"I've yet to find any of the dogs I know that love it.  I still have my allergic dog eating it, but she has to be hungry to eat this without doctoring.  My vet doesn't want me feeding her people food so I add some of Newman's or Happy Hips canned to it.<br /><br />I've talked to a couple of vets about prescription diet and they all push the big company brand names.  The common objection appears to be the soy used in Newman's to increase the protein count.<br /><br />I am willing to put a little flavor in this to feed may dog high quality, social responsible food.<br /><br />I may be the only person who has made the following mistake but, assuming you catch the Amazon sales, make sure you are ordering the bag size you want.  I thought I was getting a good price on one order until the food came and it was the seven instead of twelve pound bag."
"I have 3 large dogs, 2 lab/golden retriever mixes and 1 golden retriever, and they all loved these.  One is a little pickier than the others, and was slower to take it from my hand but once she had her first one, she didn't hesitate again.  I like these because they are healthier for my dogs, and also because they took longer to chew than an average dog biscuit.  This is a quality product, healthy for my dogs, yet obviously with ingredients that dogs love.  I also like that bit of extra chewing time they take.  I'm glad we got to try them - I will definitely be buying these again."
"The shipment was Prime but arrived in 5 days instead of 2.<br />I love dark french roast coffee, but, this coffee tasted burnt and additionally, the flavor had overtones of trash Indonesian.  Not a pleasant experience."
"Sure, this rawhide is expensive at 5-6 dollars per rawhide.  However, it is excellent quality (many rolls very tightly rolled) and takes my GSD hours to go through one.  For reference, he can eat a thick bully stick in 5 minutes and a Himalayan Dog Chew in 30 minutes.  For the time spent chewing per dollar, these rawhides are a deal!  I also love that my dogs can't get big chunks off, so even though I keep an eye on them I have very little fear of choking."
"I do like that the Greenies are softer, more chewable.  I feel it makes the product a little bit safer for my dogs to have."
"It might be a matter of taste, but this is the worst cup of coffee I ever attempted to try. My spouse and I tried three sips and dumped it."
"It's a lot of cookies, but the price is very good compared to the local grocery store.  The packages were in good shape and the cookies were fresh.  My order from January 25th has an expiration date of April 28th.  Not bad, but I would have preferred a later expiration date.  Other than that, no problems.  Exactly the same Chips Ahoy you would buy in the store."
"I am only drinking it, so it won't be wasted, and I have to rotate it with a Coffee People product, so I remember why I like coffee.  It is really wan. The strongest flavor profile is tin.  I love creme caramel and am a huge WP fan, but the flavor strenth and consistancy of this coffee does not impress. Choose another - you won't be sorry you did."
My husband and I love these. They taste soo good fresh from the microwave. I was pleased to see these as a pack of 18. I can only find 3 packs at my local grocery store and they are not as economical.
"Wonderful color I don't know what to say extremely fast delivery. I was surprised how many were really in container. I personally did not like the flavor and couldn't find any of my kids who did. To their credit they did taste like ""juicy pear"" but for me they left a bad after taste in my mouth."
"I was introduced to this product a few years ago and was floored by how tasty and depending on the amount and type of milk added (2% or whole), how chocolaty the flavor could even be.  I've recently moved and don't know where to find it locally so I'm trying the online purchasing option - I'm almost out of it!<br /><br />This is a very nice option for those of us who don't drink coffee all that often but want to have something of quality in the kitchen cupboard.  Goes great with Trader Joes hot chocolate powder too"
"I love these chips. They are light, crunchy, sweet, and salty. Buy them by the case through Amazon because they can be pricey at the grocery store."
"I don't write very many reviews but I have to say that Kettle Brand chips are the best I have ever tasted.  Every flavor is dynamite.  If you are feeling iffy about honey dijon, I would recommend cheddar beer, absolutely amazing.  And they're healthy!  (besides a lil fat)  I have eaten a lot of chips in my day and Kettle takes the cake.  Enjoy, and don't eat them too fast."
"The earths best he eats the most, this one is a little thicker than his original chicken/sweet potato favorite which is very runny."
"We love the Merrick lines of food to mix in with the Nature's Variety dried kibble.  Our dogs simply turn their noses up at this food and will not touch it.  They aren't normally fussy eaters.  I have one who will eat whatever you put in front of him, but not this.  We'll stick to Wing A Lings, Turducken and Smothered Comfort."
"The good - The caffeine is definitely in there.<br />The Bad - In my opinion, it makes my water taste like an energy drink that went flat.<br /><br />Have you ever tasted a flat red bull? What about a warm flat red bull? IMO, That's pretty close to this flavor, except it not nearly as syrupy as a red bull. Some may like that, others may not... I'll be surprised if the odds are better than 50/50 in either direction."
"I loved the taste of this tea, and then one day I read the ingredients: it contains modified corn starch! Really?  In tea? First of all, talk about the Glycemic Index of cornstarch (85 or so). Plus, 80% of all corn in the US is Genetically Modified, and I somehow doubt that Lipton is into buying organic corn. There is no way I'm ever going to buy this again."
"Please be aware that these are 6 32 oz (1 quart) packages and not half gallons as you may believe. The good thing about this is the shelf life of the packages. A normal half gallon is good for about as long as a regular milk product. These are good for months until you open them and then they are good for 10 to 14 days.  I use them to make a protein shake with fresh bananas that I have frozen. I use a non-dairy protein powder and it all tastes great.  Once I open the carton, I date it with the opening date so I can track it. That aside, it is a good product with a good taste, but not so good with cereal that gets soggy, like Raisin Bran.  It is not bad, just not the same as with 2% milk. I did not think I would like it, but, for health reasons I made the change and it is a good one."
"These are a great grab and go snack that satisfy.  I love pop corn but don't eat it that much because my husband hates my breath while I am eating it at the movies, so I take Grandpa Po's Originals instead and he keeps hogging the bag!  I know soy beans are healthy for you and this is the only way I enjoy to eat them.  I love these!!!"
"Even though this appears to be intended for dogs, I bought this for my cat Digby. He is very smart and likes puzzle toys (the ones that conceal treats of course). The problem with this toy is the depth of the 'bowls' that hold the treats. Digby cannot get his snout deep enough into the bowls to get the food. I could see a large dog with a big toungue being able to do it, but not a small dog or a cat. This is too bad because it looks like someone put some thought into this thing, they just perhaps only had one size animal in mind when they designed it. If your pet can lick the inside bottom of a jelly jar, perhaps this will be a good item to get them."
"Our 3 dogs love Dingo bones.  But these peanut butter flavor bones are an obsession of our smallest rat terrier.  He's only 5 pounds, so bones tend to last several sittings for him.  Give him one of these and he's occupied for as long as it takes to finish.  He'll still play with other bones, but he loses his mind when he sees me go for this bag.  I just wish they were priced as well as the other Dingo products and less difficult to find."
"i first tried this tea in a hotel room in san diego and never forgot it.  checked it online and was happy to find amazon had much better prices than if bought from the company.  it doesn't come in the cute, individually wrapped boxes but it's still the same great tasting green tea."
"I started with tabasco sauce at age 5, worked my way to jalapenos in my teens, then habaneros, and finally the ghost chili in my 20s. I am always on the hunt for the next HOTTEST sauce as i keep killing my taste buds on this stuff. The last sauce I rolled the dice on was the Dave's Ghost Pepper sauce and it was fantastic. I thought ghost peppers would be the hottest thing until I got my hands on this little tiny bottle called Da Bomb - The Final Answer. Hmmmm... made from Habaneros and pepper extract? It couldn't be too bad I thought. Like a champ I put a dime sized blob on a chip and tossed it in my mouth. After a few chews my parents asked me ""Well how is it?"" I tried to talk and realized once this bad boy goes aerosol or you breathe it you're done. ""It's goo.... *cough* *cough*"" My eyes began to water and the heat took over. This stuff is not a joke, not a game. Over the past year my mouth and tongue has become desensitized to it and I can eat it no problem but the intestines never lie. It feels like the devil himself is laughing while he crawls through your colon, clawing you from within. Do NOT attempt to eat this on an empty stomach. In a pathetic attempt to show off to co-workers I brought it to work and we all tried some before lunch. After a few minutes I felt as if a fiery ulcer had erupted and had to chug about 3 Sodas before it subsided. This is the hottest stuff i've found to date... yet i'm still on the hunt. Use at your own... misguided risk."
"It's hard to find crackers and other traditionally wheat products that are gluten free.  These crackers are a poor substitute.  They don't have a good taste- just starchy and, well, blah.  No amount of cheese or cracker topping can fix it.  I recommend Crunchmasters Multigrain GF crackers. They are the best that I have found."
This is awful tasting and for the price with shipping turned out to be $10 a bottle. Bought for my son's birthday party and some of the boys were puking and gaging it was so bad. You are better off buying a bottle of Franks hot sauce and chugging it down...at least it tastes good. This was my BIGGEST rip-off buy EVER!!!
Love the Green Mountain Coffee; tastes great in the Keurig and this is the best price yet!  Would definitely continue to buy!  I usually go through about a box per month and found this to be the most economical purchase!
"Shake 'N Bake has been a part of my life for years.  I can remember doing chicken breasts and pork chops with my mom many years back.  It is fun and easy, and makes plain old meat more fun.  Now my son is my ""shaker"" and he now loves it like I did.  That being said, let me tell you that it will never look like it does on the front of the package.  The coating is never as thick as in the picture.  What you get is a nice thin coating.<br /><br />This particular style of Shake 'N Bake comes in a pouch so it is missing the plastic bag that you get when you buy it the old fashioned way.  It is not difficult using a Glad or Ziplock brand bag to do your shaking.  This is a nice way to change up your usual grilled or sauteed chicken.  Give it a little shake, bake it in the oven, and enjoy!"
in my book. You can eat one serving with ease and not feel any remorse. Just wish That there were more BBQ and Cheese flavored selections. The Black pepper is the BESTEST yet.
"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:55 Mins<br /><br /></span>I bought this gum for my grandbaby who has been asking for sour gum.<br />well after tasting this myself it is anything but sour. the flavor seem<br />to be more sweet while it lasted for all of maybe 2 minutes then it tasted like paper,<br />well actually paper tastes better. This is the kind of gum your kids spits out<br />as soon as it becomes soft. it's too bad you cannot rate less than 1 this gum is a zero<br />especially at $10.00. I also bought some crybaby sour gum here on amazon have yet to recieve it.<br />I hope it tastes better and last longer than this item they call Cotton Candy sour gum.<br />It does not taste like cotton Candy it taste like stale bubblegum.<br />would not buy or recommend this product.<br />I'll do a review on the crybaby sour gum once it arrive."
"I looked forward to a delicious hot cocoa, but was very disappointed with the flavor. It has an awful aftertaste, like the taste you get after drinking a bad diet soda. Also kind of weak, even on the smallest cup setting."
Our pediatrician recommended we feed our constipated 6 month old prunes. He wasn't too thrilled with the taste but it did the job:P
"Got these to help perk-up our ""Olden Golden.""  She loved them.  Seemed to help a little.  But, I guess there's no cure for age.<br /><br />This is a far better way to get your dog to take glucosamine and chondroitin.  We had the hardest time getting her to take a pill.<br /><br />I will note that the treats get stale pretty quickly if you don't seal the bag well (it's ziplock.)"
I bought my Keurig coffee machine a couple of months ago and sense then I think I have drunk more coffee in these last two months than I have my entire life and I am 64.<br />I have been trying to sample all the K-cups. This is just one group that I have tried.<br />It is soooooooooo nice to get out of bed in the morning and get a fresh cup of coffee no worrying about what I'm going to do with all that coffee  left in the pot going stale.<br />I LOVE MY KEURIG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />PS<br />I got a collection of coffee makers some hardly used. ANYBODY WANT THEM!!!!!!!!?????????<br />Jim Brandt
"It tastes the same as the first original ""International Instant Coffee"". With a little sugar, it tastes ok but it's not smooth enough to call it cappaccino. Mostly I taste the powdered creamer. It would be ok to use as a base flavor to add other flavors in; especially if you added the same spices you use to make chai latte. A grocer around here would charge about $3.50 a can for it. I have to say that it tastes better than the House Blend they make for single cup coffee makers. I wouldn't buy this again though, and I'm not interested in finishing the can."
"How much can you say about a drink? It tastes pretty good! It's got a nice flavor, sweet, but not overly so and there's a good amount of fizz. There's a lot of sugar for the amount of drink you have, and at only 8.3 fluid ounces, there just isn't much there. What's there is good though!"
very disappointed with this product. Although the taste is good it was difficult to serve these crackers with a topping of hummus to other celiac friends. The two foil pkgs in each box does not guarantee is whole cracker. From one foil pkg. in the first box I ordered I had 5 whole crackers...the rest of the foil pkg. was broken pieces. This does not speak well for Glutino products. I will never order them from Amazon again.
"I usually never give bad reviews to products but this is so bad. I have peanut butter daily, I love it so much. I got this to mix into smoothies but it is far too salty to use that way. It taste nothing like peanut butter. It is just gross."
"Dear honey lovers!<br /><br />My name is Jan, from Attiki-Pittas, the producer of Attiki. Thank you all very much for sharing your opinion on our honey. As you'll understand, this is always great for us to learn about! I hadn't seen these reviews before, that's why this is a bit of a late reply. Sorry for that.<br /><br />Honey Attiki is a multi flower honey, a blend of Greek honeys from the wild: flowers, thyme and coniferous.<br /><br />@ Tudor: I just wanted to assure you that our honey is as pure as it comes from the beehive. There are no processes involved that diminish the unique health and quality beneficial values of the honey, nor do we use any additives. It is a 100% natural, 100% pure and 100% Greek honey, with all the related benefits.<br /><br />Thanks to great periods of sunshine combined with unique landscape characteristics, Greek honey is highly concentrated. The honey is gathered from a variety of around 6000 different types of natural flowers, herbs and trees, 600 of which are only found in Greece.<br /><br />In Greece we have about 80% of the year sunshine. Besides the fact that this is obviously pretty great to live in, you also know that sunshine means health and healing. All this is what Greek honey represents. It is great for your health and it has so many benefits for your body and even mind (stress relief, against insomnia, to name some) that you really treat yourself on something exceptional when you eat Greek honey and Attiki, as the most popular honey from Greece, is celebrated for its great taste.<br /><br />If it interests you, Greek honey is one of the most studied honeys in the world and if you Google it, you will find quite some information about all the specific qualities and uses of it. If you like to know more about Attiki, you can always contact me: info (AT> attiki-pittas &lt;DOT) gr, to the attention of Jan.<br /><br />Sweet greetings from Greece!"
after opening numerous bags I found that none of the chips had any flavoring on them. completely plain and gross. how does this even happen?
I have ordered from this vendor before so was surprised to see that the k cup box was crushed this time.  It may be the shipper that was at fault though since they were in a sturdy box with adequate packaging. The k cups were impacted though so I was not able to use them all.
"Although it sounded delicious, I was very disappointed in this coffee. The coffee has a strange, chemical aftertaste ... cup after cup, not just once.  Even when it brews, it creates a chemical sort of aroma.  In fact, because our single-serve pod coffee brewer was new, I started thinking the problem was the brewer.  We assumed it was a left-over manufacturing plastic or metal aftertaste coming through in the water.  I even e-mailed the coffee machine maker (Bunn) to see how to remove the aftertaste.  Imagine our surprise when a month later we opened a new pack of pods (regular Colombian, not flavored) and were delighted that our machine makes great coffee.  When we made a cup of the Senseo Vanilla again -- back came the off-taste and aroma.  Perhaps it's the ""artificial flavors"" used?  Be forewarned!"
"The sugar police strike again and ruin a oatmeal taste that was always selling out in my local supermarket... Now the huge flakes and horrid taste has made me an ex-Quaker consumer. There are plenty of choices out there for low sugar oatmeals why screw around with this classic, or why not just make another version and leave this one alone?<br /><br />Horrible"
I am not a fan of any of the decaf k cups I have tried but this one is probably the best.I like strong coffee and his comes pretty close to what I would expect although it says medium roast.
Everything was wonderful!  arrived quickly and everything was just fine!  ...what a world!  I really enjoy this coffee and it taste good too.
"Very smooth and I used my own filters. The smell is so inviting, I used my own measurements because it was not on the package.  I used l tblsp. per cup and I worked out fine for me, I like my coffee tasteful."
"I decided to try this formula for my baby since he started being very gassy. However, this formula made him more gassy...the formula is very thick and produces a lot of bubbles that gets fed to the baby. I tried to make the formula with anticipation to let the bubbles disolve but that didn't work."
"I bought this for all my deck containers this year, and I'm not really that impressed with it. The plants look fine, but I have way fewer flowers than I've ever had using regular potting soil. I also had two plants die, and I have no idea why. I read one other review that said her plants were cooking in the sun - that the contents of her containers felt HOT to her. This could be my exact problem as well. Both plants that died were in full sun. Next year I will buy regular potting soil and a big package of Miracle Grow plant food instead!"
"This product is labeled ""100% of what you want"". But one look at the nutrition facts and you may not agree. While it contains 100% juice and vitamin C, no preservatives or sugar, it contains 135 calories, 15 mg of sodium, and a whopping 34 grams of carbohydrates. All this in a tiny 8.3 oz can! I also thought it was too sweet for my tastes, but I normally drink a diet carbonated beverage, so the sweetness did jump out at me. Just okay. I won't add this to my shopping list."
"Personal preference... too sweet.  Tastes like General Foods International Coffees.  Price is great if you like that, though.  And makes up very easy."
"I didn't like this drink at all! It had a very strange, almost chemically taste to it. I also didn't appreciate Switch marketing itself as ""all-natural"" but had ingredients like ""natural flavors and colors"". What are they?? Are they even natural?? I even let my three year old try it but she couldn't even swallow it and spit it out in the sink. Too bad. It would have been a good alternative to sodas but not with this horrible taste. My daughter and I much prefer the OOba Hibiscus drink."
"Agree with other reviewers that PB2 is twice as expensive on Amazon so definitely shop around for better deals.  The texture of PB2, when mixed according to directions, is similar to natural peanut butter.  I add an extra 1-2 tsps of water to get a fluffier creamier texture and it doesn't water down the flavor.  It's not bad as a PB substitute and I really wasn't expecting it to be identical to the real thing.  The texture and mouthfeel isn't as satisfying as the real PB, but the flavor is fantastic.  It works best when used as a flavoring agent or substitute rather than eaten as simply a spoon full of PB. I will definitely buy more but from another seller that offers it at a fair price and with very reasonable shipping fees."
"Not only am I not a fan of tea, I'm not a fan of licorice but I was open to trying this as a means to help me manage my IBS (I also use fennel and peppermint tea). This tastes so delicious, I want to drink it whether my stomach feels good or not! Yummy! And a cup does sooth my savage stomach."
"This is not Decaf ""Extra Bold"". Something is wrong with the computer or the person shipping the product. They have sent Decaf ""Light Roast"" twice in place of Decaf ""Extra Bold"". This really needs to be fixed. I sent back the first order. The second order they decided to overnight to me to make up for the mistake. I know the second time it also said Decaf ""Light Roast"" on the box, but I opened it anyway in hope it was just marked wrong on the outside box and inside would be the correct product. No such luck. I now have coffee I don't want. I'm sure the Decaf Extra Bold is great coffee but if they can't send it I can't try it!!!"
I have purchase a number of products from Jack Links and have been generally pleased. This item however was awful. It was old and mouldy. Could not eat them.
"My yellow lab loves staying busy and trying new things. After my dog, Homer played the Paw Hide-Dog Toy Puzzle it confirmed how smart he actually is. There were treats placed under each puzzle piece. He was able to figure out the game and get the prize...the treats! It keeps him entertained and I can really tell that he likes it. I have been bragging to all my friends that my dog has a puzzle game and that he actually understands it. Such a smart puppy! Awesome!<br /><br />This is a social writeup"
There is nothing like real maple syrup.  Grade B is the highest quality syrup.  Will definately order this product again.  Price is good too for this quality.
"As the first reviewer said, this soup disappeared from the markets I shop here in the east, so, per usual, I searched Amazon.  This soup is outstanding on its own, and for low carbers/diabetics, it is a special treat. I use this mostly as a sauce for chicken, pork chops, veggies. I treat it like mushroom soup for a sauce, thinning with cream or broth if needed, which normally I don't.  It has just a bit of spiciness to it, and for me it makes a big difference in ease of prep and added variety to what are sometimes bland dishes. There are few canned soups I like, but Progresso makes the ones I find palatable. The French Onion is especially delicious and good for saucing."
"I'm flabbergasted by the glowing reviews that ""truffle oil"" is receiving on Amazon! Those of you espousing a desire to drizzle this stuff on your food might be sorely disappointed to learn that the truffle flavor in those tiny $17 bottles of ""truffle oil"" are made in a laboratory. There's not a molecule of actual truffle in them. It's a sinful shame that's perpetuated despite being outed a few years ago in an enlightening New York Times article called ""Hocus-Pocus, and a Beaker of Truffles."" Read it and weep: [...]<br /><br />And if you see ""truffle oil"" advertised on the menu somewhere, you might ask if they're using any other artificial flavorings in their dishes..."
"Very versatile, tasty grain and much more reasonable to purchase here in this quantity than buying it a package at a time in the local store."
"On an untypically cool August evening we decided to try Melitta Riviera Sunset Decaf. I heaped in too much coffee and what we got was a bitter, overly heavy cup . I know others like their coffee to curl their hair with strong taste. We like it strong but not THAT  much. On our next try we used less coffee and enjoyed a delightful semi-sweet cup of decaf. It was pleasing. Those who love strong, robust, full-bodied taste ought to definitely buy Melitta brand coffees."
This is the best all around 1st cup in the morning coffee ever!  I love it.  Perfect flavor.
"The particular packages had an off taste. However, the seller gave me a complete refund and didn't even make me send them back. I have ordered this item before and they were fine."
"I love Cherrybrook Kitchen and have tried almost all of their products.  I was excited to try the Ready to Spread frosting, as I do not usually keep the needed ingredients on hand for their box frosting.  I am not a picky eater, especially if the item contains sugar... but this was horrible!  The consistency is absolutely nothing like regular canned frosting.  It is not light and fluffy.  It is very gooey.  I cannot even imagine trying to spread it on a cake - it would rip it to pieces because it is so thick and gooey.  I did not even try it on a cake, because the taste and texture were so off-putting.  Seriously, do not waste your money!"
"This is my absolute favorite gluten free baking mix. You ""must"" add in the suggested ""extras"" to make the best brownies: 1/2 c sour cream, 1/2 c chocolate chips or chunks. Sometimes takes longer to bake also, so dont overbake, but worth the time/wait! Those who can eat gluten fight over these brownies with me! :-)"
Thai Chili Roasted Garlic by Wild Tymes is the best. I take an 8oz block of cream cheese and spread about 3 tablespoons of the Thai Chili on top and serve with Triscuit crackers. It has been very popular at my home parties. Plus the cream cheese cuts down on the spicy heat.
"Love these chips.  They are perfectly seasoned and of course have no grease at all.  There is also not the cardboard taste of a baked chipped.  The popped texture of the potatoes is nice and light. They are only 100 calories a bag, but there are lots of chips in the bag so it's a great snack.  The ingredient list is also pretty wholesome without any strange chemicals added.  Fav flavor is probably salt and pepper or bbq."
"I really wanted these to taste good, but there is something in there that is very bitter. I had to add too much sugar to make them even slightly palatable. No one would eat them. They LOOKED delicious after baking and they're healthy, but that's only if you manage to choke one down. I have tried their gingerbread, corn muffin mix, and jalapeno cornbread mix and those are all great."
"The lolipops were melted to the cellophane(in February). Each individual pop had ""Oriental Trading"" and a 1-800 phone # printed on the wrapper. I intended it as a gift and it was absolutely unsuitable. Had to return."
These condiments are overpriced and terrible. The classic is disgustingly sweet. The spiced tastes like a bad spicy marinara sauce from a chain restaurant.
I ordered the Teenie pack of Greenies that was supposed to come with 96 teenie sized chews. I ended up receiving a pack with 52 teenie sized chews and 8 large chews. I returned the product because I did not receive what I ordered. Amazon couldn't replace my order because they couldn't guarantee I would get the right product if ordered again.
OK...but would never buy them again my husband ate some...<br /><br /> I thought they tasted a lot like the chips they used to call MUNCHO'S!<br /><br /> Just not for me!
"Great Product, fast shipment,the food product tasted great. none of the fortune cookies where opened.  i would buy again from this seller!"
"I love lemon marmalade.  They are hard to find, and in the last few years I could not find any in the stores so I decided to buy this Lemon marmalade without being able to look at it closely.  I am attaching a couple of pictures so you can see the content not just the label.<br /><br />I was looking forward to getting it so much. When the box arrived I opened it and tried the marmalade right away... but it was a huge disappointment.  First, it is no a true marmalade it is a jelly. I am attaching two pictures where you can see maybe a couple of lemon zest strips in the entire 454 gram (16 oz).  Second the jelly is soooo very sweet. There is not enough tartness I expected from a lemon marmalade. Third it had a weird texture, it left what I would describe as an oily feel in my mouth unlike any other jelly I have tried.<br /><br />List of ingredients:<br />Sugar 62g per 100g<br />Glucose-fructose syrup<br />Lemons<br />Gelling Agent: Pectin, Citric Acid<br />Acidity Regulator:Sodium Citrate<br />Flavoring: Lemon Oil<br />Color:Caramel E150C<br /><br /> Price with shipping slightly over $11.<br /><br />I eat a lot of different jams. I like having jam with my tea.  I will not be able to eat this jelly with my tea because I really did not like so many things about it. I will try cooking with it, maybe it will work on a chicken as a sauce.  I am so disappointed!<br /><br />8/22/11 Update<br />Normally I would not comment on a specific seller on a product review, but I think in this case it is relevant.<br />Enclosed with the marmalade was FoodIreland 100% satisfaction guarantee flyer with a contact email.  I contacted them over the weekend letting them know I was disappointed in the product. On Monday I received a notification of a full refund.  So if you like jellies the stellar customer service removes the risk of giving it a try."
"This hot chocolate does not have the strongest flavor, but it is incredibly creamy and smooth. Definitely worth the price for that much."
"Delicious Marzipan. Niederegger makes the best marzipan. The assortment is lovely and very tasty. Although the portions are small, they are dense with flavor and richness, and are quite satisfying."
I just bought a new Great Northern 8 ounce Popcorn Machine and I bought the 6 ounce packs and 8 ounce and both taste chewy. This popcorn seems to have a lot of moisture in it because all the windows tend to steam up really good. I also tried leaving the doors slightly open and metal try completely open which helps with the steam but the popcorn still comes out chewy. I'll try ordering a different brand.
"As with Thomas Wolfes' theme in the novel ""You Can't Go Home Again"", attempts to relive youthful memories will always fail.  Just as these Broadway Rolls have for me.  If you are looking for a very tart strawberry flavor and gummy consistency, then this is your kind of licorice.  If you are looking for the subtle taste and firmer texture of the original Delfa Roll you had when you were a kid, forget it.  This will disappoint you.  Obviously, there was some demand for the company to attempt to bring it back, but if they went to the effort to do so, how come they did't obtain the recipe patent?!?!"
"But the taste got sickening quite fast. It also makes a really weird stench/smell when you are microwaving it. Sometimes it would hurt my tongue when I am eating it. All in all, I threw the rest of them away after my 3rd bag. It might just be me but I can't say I would let the guests of my home try these so I can't recommend them here to anyone."
"We all know how picky cats can be.  It may be grain free, but food still smells, looks like, and fine details in label indicate ""highly processed"" with all the extra vitamins & minerals, which I think is the ""turnoff"" for the kitties. Doesn't say up front, but also contains New Zealand Green Mussell, which I am not sure how that ingredient fits in as I am not from New Zealand, but suspect locals rely on that for nutrients as we do mussells in this country.  They are spoiled on the real thing - minimally processed or raw rabbit, chicken, bird, wild caught salmon.  They will eat canned only if minimally processed.  Another cat food bites the dust but gives the dogs another treat! 1 STAR for not knowing about the New Zealand Mussell & for still being highly processed & therefore unpalatable as food for cats that love rabbit. 5 Star for a dog treat without the added hormones, grains, etc."
Bisquick GF is easy to use. Pancakes and muffins are very<br />tasty. The product is quick and easy to use. It makes my day.  Gram
"I am writing this on behalf of my dog, who enjoys this product.  He's a fairly strong chewer, this is a sizable bone for 40 lb dog and it keeps him occupied.  So far have had no issues w/ splintering or chipping.  Would buy again."
"I bought the SmartyKat CatnipMist because it received a couple of decent reviews and it was one tenth the cost of ""From the Field"" Catnip  Essential Oil Rejuvenator, which I had tried before. Well, you know what they say, ""If it's too good to be true, it is too good to be true.""<br /><br />SmartyKat CatnipMist just didn't work with my two cats. They sniffed it and then just walked away. They weren't remotely interested.<br /><br />Like I say, I have tried and liked the effectiveness of ""From the Field"" Catnip  Essential Oil Rejuvenator. But, From the Field is costly. Well, you know what they also say...""You get what you pay for."" I'll stick with ""From the Field"" Catnip  Essential Oil Rejuvenator."
I think that Kelloggs Frosted Mini-wheats is absolutely wonderful because it's sweet and because it's filling.  I have it every morning. It is so full of fiber that it makes for a breakfast that will stick with you for a morning free of cravings.  The best part of the 58.8 size of Kellogs Frosted Mini-Wheats is that it has two complete bags of cereal inside.  Love it!
"The label on the little bag says 1 serving is 120 calories. But one serving is 1 ounce. The little single serving sized bag is 1.5 ounces! So there are 180 calories in the bag. This is sneaky. No one is going to open their bag and measure out one ounce, then save the other half ounce...<br /><br />EDITED TO ADD:<br />I ordered these again because the price went down momentarily (is now back up) and the product is now changed. Although Amazon still had it listed at 12, 1.5 ounce bags, what I got is 12, 1.2 oz bags. So now yes, one bag is a serving but the nutrition facts do not add up to what was listed before. Now a bag has 120 calories and 15g carbs. Another sneaky move, you get less for the same price."
"I have read past reviews where people complained about receiving dented cans with this product. I had a previous shipment where all was well, but not this time. The shipment came in a badly mangled box, but I thought all would be well when the interior box was pristine. I was very surprised to find a badly dented can in an undamaged box. This tells me that the can was already dented when packed. Amazon should reconsider their source for this product--the tomatoes are superior but the packing stinks."
I love this tea - bold and smooth. I love the fact that you can use the tea leaves for more than one steep. It really makes it go a long way. I will be getting this again!
"I love sweet potato and especially sweet potato chips. When I tried the original popchips, I was surprised by how good the taste and texture was, so I bought this in bulk, thinking it would be excellent because of the company and because I love sweet potatoes of course.<br />I was wrong.<br /><br />For some reason, the sweet potato chip they've created tastes like cardboard despite having the same texture (cross between rice cake and chip), added with a dash of salt. That's it. I can't describe it any other way than a ""bland blah taste with salt""<br /><br />I wish I had gotten the parmesean garlic or the original instead."
Love the flavor- everyone can choose just what they want.Strength can be varied using more or less water.always comes out the same.
"I bought this for my 10-month old son.  He loves pumpkin and I ran out of the fresh pumpkin I pureed and froze.  He didn't like another brand so I thought I'd try this one.  He likes it a lot and it serves its purpose.  My only complaint is that it has chunks of pumpkin skin in it.  Some of the pieces are large enough that I have to fish them out so my son doesn't choke on it.  Other than that, it's exactly as advertised and when we run out of the first order, I will buy more."
Was nervous about ordering this because one reviewer said it was not fresh.. We ordered two bags and no problem. Our rat terrier and my daughter's standard schnauzer love this food. They rejected several other brands and flavors before we found this food. Their coats are beautiful and they digest this product very well.
"Cannot detect any difference from other ghees.  Also, their supposed 'free' sample is not really. They ship a tiny jar in a box through the mail and it costs about $2.00 in postage, something for the box and it costs you $4.99.<br /><br />Very disappointed.  They should reconsider doing that because it taints all of their offerings."
"This bags are very difficult to open with the aid of some tool, such as scissors, don't even try without scissors.<br /><br />They are crispy and taste like chips that aren't advertised as being salted. They definitely aren't healthy, because I can feel the grease all over my fingers when eating them, and I can see the grease at the bottom of the bag, too.<br /><br />They are high-quality chips, and deserve to be put on your table."
I used this to make bread in my bread machine.  At last a gluten-free loaf of bread that does not crumble!  This bread is more like wheat bread than any other mix or recipe that I have tried.
"My dog love it, and She's a very, very picky eater- even with treats. So, this product must have a great flavor."
I am from England and I was raised on this custard. If you like vanilla custard/pudding you will love this. It's rich and creamy and has lots of vanilla taste.  I love that it comes in a big canister and I can make as much as I want to. I would never make a trifle with anything else.
"This stuff is gold for the hot/spicy food enthusiast.  I put it on most everything other than breakfast (Grape Nuts).  I really think you get way more value from this than any hot sauce in a bottle...  This is basically what is in that fancy bottle hot sauce, just without a fancy label.  Try it.  16oz goes a long way!"
"I bought this for my 3 month old puppy, thinking it would keep her busy and entertained. It took her about 20 minutes to figure out that she could lay in her bed with the bottle tilted against the side, and the food would keep coming out if she just moved it periodically. I ended up giving the toy away because she was able to be too lazy with it. I gave the toy 4 stars, though, because I doubt this would happen with most dogs. Quite frankly it shocked the heck out of me when I saw what she was doing."
"I have been consuming these coconut bars for several months now after having purchased a small box at HomeGoods. These bars are delicious! They taste like the inside of a Mounds Bar. Only 2 ingredients: shredded coconut & rice syrup. I have purchased the 20 pack box through Amazon a few times. One of the latest boxes contained bars that tasted odd. They were darker in color and did not have the fresh coconut taste I was used to. Perhaps they were in a delivery truck that was hot and the oil in the coconut started to go rancid? Anyway, I contacted the company (Oskri) and their quality department was great. They provided a return shipping label for the unconsumed bars and shipped out a brand new box of 20 bars plus some additional samples to try. I have read some other reviewers that said they didn't like the taste of the bars. It's too bad they didn't try to contact the company because I'm sure they would have sent out a replacement product. I did notice though that the nutrition information has changed even though the weight & contents of the bar are the same. The calories, fat & sugar have all increased (180 cals vs. 246 cals, 11 grams vs. 14 grams, 14 grams vs. 29 grams). That is unfortunate, and I will have to cut down on my consumption. However, these bars really do taste yummy! They are soft, chewy, sweet & fresh. My husband and I love them, and I have gotten a few friends hooked on them too!"
"Terrible! Artificial lemon taste, like Pledge Lemon Furniture Polish. Don't do this to yourself. Just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest."
"I buy all of these different snack foods for my husband and when I saw these oversized ravioli with Italian sausage I couldn't leave it out.  He said it's very big, very bold and very tasty."
"Disgusting, slimy, stinky!  I love jerky but have a weak jaw and have trouble chewing it. A diet website recommended this meatless jerky, so I ordered it to try it.  Absolutely horrible!  I recently gave the entire order (except for a small bite I tasted) to a friend to be donated to feed the homeless.  I hope someone may like it.  It comes from the package wet and slimy and has a clove-like odor.  That's about all I can remember about it."
"I made Chebe rolls this evening for dinner.  They needed to be cooked an extra 10 minutes and they still were gooey and sticky in the middle.  They tasted somwhat okay, but the texture and color (clear) of the middle was very unappitizing.  I won't buy them again."
"To be honest with you, I got these at a store. You think wow chocolate chips, and Oreos. Think again.For those that think these are so good, I would recommend the Hershey's or Reese's crisp wafer bars. My honest view on these ""thin crisps"" cookies is that they have a little more flavor than a communion wafer, or milk bones."
"The taste is bitter, the smell is atrocious, and they are not naturally smoked.  ""Aqueous natural smoke"" is a chemical stew injected into the fish.  For anyone thinking these are the real thing, all I can say is 'there is a sucker born every minute.'"
"I love this cereal so much, it is my favorite right now. It's the perfect amount of cinnamon, sugar and grain. While others have a problem with the sugar content, that's what I love so much about it, there's sugar crystals in this cereal that other cereals don't have. Yeah it does get soggy pretty fast, but that's not really a bad thing because it tastes great either way you go!"
"Overall, this mix is okay, but, the sugar content is very, very high. You can actually see the sugar in the mix if you look closely. For pancakes or waffles, this is fine, but for savory concoctions, this is not acceptable. Sausage balls, casseroles, and biscuits all come out almost inedible.This mix is also oddly gritty. The grit is very fine, but still makes my teeth want to curl.  I recommend Pamela's baking and pancake mix, as it is smoother, and much more versatile, because it's not as sweet. A good cook knows you can always add more of something, but you can't take it out if you've added too much.<br /><br />That being said, if you're traveling and this is the only mix they have, it's better than nothing."
"These are really good!!!  Also, be sure to try the Cherry Blossom flavor if you can - that one tastes absolutely wonderful!!  This doesn't stick to your teeth at all and it has a very pleasant taste and even smell to it.  One pack has just enough pieces.  Great to bring along when you're traveling.  I gave some to a 7yr old and she loved it!  Because it's not too sweet (none of that dreaded corn syrup in here), people of all ages would easily approve of this - I certainly do and would not hesitate to recommend this to everyone!"
I do not like sour taste and this has a sour kind of taste which i don't like. The smell isn't that great either
There were maggots in the box on arrival.  Such a great surprise when I went to prepare lunch for my three year old.
I am having to change my original post on this tea. My husband and I both suffer from sinus problems. I made up a big tea pot (with 2 tea bags) and let it steep for 15 minutes. I had 2 cups and my husband had one. Neither of us noticed any difference with our sinuses. A few days later I decided to try the tea again. I brewed one cup of tea with one tea bag. I let it sit again for several minutes. I guess the first time I tried it I did not make it strong enough. This time I noticed a difference as my sinuses are a little clearer.
"My daughter thinks this tastes nasty, and I agree. She is sensitive to carrot, so I was looking for a food for travel that delivers protein but doesn't contain carrot. Though she eats homemade turkey and peas all the time, she wouldn't even take a full bite of this. I tasted a little bit, and I can see why."
"Saw these chips about 9 months ago and bought the BBQ  at a Giant store in their organic section.<br />These chips are light but tasty and have a good BBQ flavor.<br />Of course they aren't  Herr's or Lays but a good for you substitute. These chips are popped like pop corn. The package explains the process.<br />Trader's Joe's, sells their version for $1.99 a dollar less than Giant but I swear they are the same chips with different names.<br />Try them."
"Delicious!<br />Ideal to eat with fruit, and if you want to eat with some chips (is not too spicy) i like this very much"
"My baby is 7 months old and maybe wasn't as ready for these biscuits as I imagined. He's got 2 bottom teeth and is very able to get chunks off these biscuits! The pieces take a long time to dissolve/break down in his mouth, but he handles it better than I would expect and he can't wait to dive in for more. He has tasted a wide variety of foods and I've never seen him get so excited about any of them. He LOVES Belle's Blueberry teething biscuits - especially after they've been in the freezer for a bit. Even though I have to watch him closely, they're exactly the cure for little man's teething pains!"
"My dog figured this out really fast and likes it a lot. However, it's over priced since my dog can get to the treats fast and he's a fast eater. I would suggest investing in a treat ball instead. That'll keep there attention longer and they are similarly priced."
"I do NOT recommend these.  My six month old Golden Retriever, who is not a strong chewer, devoured this in less than five minutes.  It is a very expensive treat and I'm just hoping we don't have to pay a vet bill on top of the price of the Edible Nylabone.  I will never buy these again!!!"
"PLEASE research, on the web! This product nearly killed my dog! All of Dogswell jerky treats are Poison!! Made in China! This Dist. does not seem to care he is killing our pets. Fda told me 70 dogs have died from these kind of dog treats. BEWARE! I have over 1,000.00 in vet bills. Amazon please don't sell this line to us, talk with the FDA,<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AJ1ULS"">Dogswell Happy Hips for Dogs, Chicken Breast,15-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a> find another product made in the USA, before more of our furry friends get sick or die."
"This food was recommended due to chronic problems with skin disorders (as many Labs have).  Our lab has the thickest, shiniest coat I've ever seen, and not one skin issue ever!  I credit the AvoDerm food for that!"
"I didn't realize I was getting 20 packets of these chips but I was happy to see them when they arrived.  I love anything sweet potato so I opened the box eagerly and started chowing down.  They are delicious!  My only concern is that I don't really like the texture of anything ""popped"" but because the flavor is delicious I can overlook that.  These chips would work perfectly with many diet plans.  They are very crispy and although you won't confuse them with ""real"" chips they will satisfy that urge for something crunchy.  I'm going to buy them in several other flavors to keep on hand."
"We enjoyed these, as they have a light taste unencumbered by heavy oils and the byproducts of frying. No doubt they're much healthier than your standard potato chips, though I will say that Terra's sweet potato chips blow these away for taste, but then they're fried.<br /><br />The main issue here is value. These chips weigh about half what a bag of good chips cost, for the same money. Healthy or not, there needs to be some value, and at a buck for well under an ounce, I'm not sure these have that; I need to eat two bags to feel like I've had a snack. If you only need a tiny bit of something to make you feel full, then this might be perfect, though.<br /><br />But if you want to crunch a lot, don't want fried food, and prefer the sensation of eating a lot to actually eating a lot (dieters!), this would be a fine snack, and a unique taste."
"I purchased a hot air popcorn popper because my kids love popcorn, and it's a healthy snack.<br /><br />I 'accidentally' ordered the white popcorn, having no idea what I was doing, and I have to say that no other popcorn compares. We went through the entire container. When I re-ordered, I decided to try the regular yellow popcorn, and it just wasn't the same. If I could describe the difference, I would say that yellow popcorn tastes 'stale' in comparison. The white popcorn tastes crisper and more fresh.<br /><br />As for the flavor, well, we use Kernel Seasons seasoning generously, so we don't taste much more than the cheddar cheese :)<br /><br />I'm considering giving the rest of this yellow popcorn tub away so I have an excuse to buy another tub of the white popcorn.<br /><br />For how we eat it, this popcorn is absolutely the best!<br /><br />NOTE: I also recommend the Misto oil spray. We use this and Kernel seasons as a healthy alternative to butter."
"We have tried numerous recipes, but this makes the best Gluten Free bread yet in my opinion.  I love the sweet bread recipe also."
These were NOT good.  They were hard and chewy and my kids wouldn't eat them.  That says a lot b/c my kids will normally eat anything!
"we just love this popcorn.  Works better in our popper than others, and tastes ""earthy"".  great"
"I am a huge coffee drinker, and love the k-cups for making one cup quickly before leaving for work in the morning.  While there are many choices, I prefer a bold, strong coffee first thing in the morning.  Wolfgang Puck French Roast is absolutely delicious, strong and not at all bitter, and makes a great first cup of coffee.  I would highly recommend to all bold coffee drinkers!"
"I guess I'm in the minority, but I really didn't like these much. I was so excited for a cheesecake flavor when I saw it, but these were disappointing. The bars are super sickly sweet with a weird chemically fake vanilla-ish undertaste. Absolutely NO cheesecake or cream cheese type flavor and even the graham layer is just sweet without any real graham cracker taste. The overall texture is slightly gritty and gummy -- not at all creamy. Sizewise they are smallish, but pretty standard for any of the many 100 calorie-ish snack pack foods. Similar in price as most granola and snack bars, none of which are ever much of a good value. Overall, while they aren't inedible or anything, I would not buy these again and I don't even think I'll bother with the rest of the box."
"Love the product.  Bought about 2 weeks ago, but the cost has gone up $12.00 very quickly.  Am buying from another source."
The pineapple coconut combination is refreshing. I especially like that there is no added sugar. This is a welcomed change from other brands.
"This is the first time I am giving some negative review for the products that I bought. I have ordered this item to avoid tax and competitive price with Costco. But Quality of the taste is different from the product that I bought outside stores like Walmart, Target, Costco...<br /><br />So think before you buy.."
"We get this on a regular monthly shipment and enjoy a decent discount. Coffee has gone up some , but we love this and Amazon has the best deal ! Wish Costco or Sam's would carry it like some others as their deals are the best!"
"This toy is not that great for my pug. He loves finding stuff in the little cups, however the yellow covers are impossible for him to get off. His mouth won't fit around them so he can't pick them up with his teeth, when he uses his nose to try to get at them the cups just fall back into place and if he uses his paws (that's when he's really frustrated) he winds up just flipping the whole thing over. I have turned the cups upside down so that he can grab at the edges and that works for him. However, it's not really a puzzle because he even figured out that if the cup is sticking up, something is in there. I even have a hard time getting some of the cups out because of the way it is shaped. It's not a bad toy as a starter puzzle but if your dog has done puzzles before, this one won't keep him interested. And if you have a dog with no snout, it's not really worth it."
"these are the best chips ever. I will buy them again, wish more stores had them.The plain chips are my fav."
Fresh scent and taste. Easy to eat one tin in few hours. I use them as favors and everyone loved them.
I wish I had read the other two reviews here. I picked this up at a local store for about 6 bucks. My dog just ate half of it in 5 minutes and would be done with it now if I had not taken it away. And he is only 5 months old...so an older bigger dog could destroy this even quicker. I can't believe they actually sell these...at that price at least. He absolutely loved it and is quite mad I took it away...but not worth the money.
This coffee brews very weak - like a light roast.  W.P. Chef's reserve pods are just over half full.  Put pod on scale and it's 15% less coffee wgt than normal pods.  Stick with normal pods or extra bold if you like coffee that taste like coffee.
"I ordered the Grade B Hidden Springs Syrup -- Grade B is my favorite for baking.  I love the strong, rich maple flavor.  This is my favorite amongst several maple syrups that I've ordered from Amazon.  Maple syrup is understandably expensive, but this syrup is a good value among its' competitors."
i recieved the fly trap and it seemed fine i put it in a nice sunny area it did good but then 2 days later it just died so i paid 15 bux for a plant that lived 3 days lol
"Cheap: A plastic tube with some presumably lightweight circuit inside.  Never worked right; no user interface, no known way to engage or defeat the phantom power."

I also ordered a flat of food (they were on sale) that contained The Turkey and Wild Rice Dinner.  One of them was also improperly sealed; the lid popped.  We were lucky because I just happened to check that one.  Now I'm so paranoid that I check all of them several times.  I called Earth's Best and they assured me that they haven't had this problem before and that I shouldn't worry about it.  I'm so suprised that this got passed QA/QC inspection at a baby food manufacturer.  Why would a company take the risk of bad publicity when baby food manufacturers rely so much on a reputation of safety?!
"I LOVE this body wash!  It smells nice, works great, and feels great on your skin.  Add in the fact that with the Subscribe and Save deal, it is a great value, I'm sold!"
"I love this product. Tazo has produced a mild, yet sweet and spicy tea that I can only call magic. Sweet Cinnamon Spice has a flavor all on it's own, and I highly recommend it for adventurous spice tea drinkers looking for that perfect balance."
"I do reccomend this product, as it is effective and very fun to try. Here are the setbacks: It only lasts around 30 minutes, not 2 hours. I bought these in lieu of the actual berries ($90 vs. $10) so they weren't as potent as I had read about/expected. Nonetheless, they do work! Lemons and limes were delicious!<br />Oh, be sure to move the tablet over the ENTIRE surface of your tounge in order to cover ALL of your taste buds."
"Unfortunately, I was disappointed with this chocolate--too heavily spiced and too sweet; not enough of that velvety, smooth pure chocolate that I prefer. I have 4 tins that I will give away to friends and family.  I'll be back and will let you know how they like it."
"The product description should note that only six packages are included for this price, NOT an entire case (which would be 12 packs)."
"This coffee produced a dark and rich cup of coffee that tasted great.  I found this stuff to be ground a bit fine -- more along the lines of espresso than something I would put into my regular coffee maker, and way too fine for my press. I'd give it five stars except for the packaging: I've opened hundreds of bags of coffee in my time, but this is the first one that I pretty much destroyed.  The bag is sealed along each of the corners to make a seam at each edge and those seams don't like to come apart.  Unfortunately, the remaining opening was too small to get my tablespoon inside to get the coffee out, so I had to rip the sides out a bit."
"These are for people that cannot tolerate sugar. They are not low cal, just slightly lower cal. The regular Coffee Rio Original Coffee Caramels made with sugar average 15 calories per piece or 60 calories per 17.3 grams, which is 4 pieces. The sugar free version averages 12.5 calories per piece or 50 calories per 16.5 grams, which about 4 pieces. Thatt's 20% fewer calories per piece.<br /><br />They are slightly softer as the regular Rios and much less sweet and much less flavorful. In terms of flovaor, there is no comparison -- the regular are rich; the sugarfree are bland, emphasis on the ""bla"". Eating these is a big sacrifice for 20% fewer calories. If you want to reduce caloric intake, the if you can work up the discipline to skip one piece for every 4 you eat, you total enjoyment might be much greater with the 20% fewer calories.<br /><br />They are made with real coffee and milk and Splenda sweetener, and other things.<br /><br />If you have partial fillings or crowns or braces, etc. you will want to avoid chewing these even though the are sotftler than the sugared version.<br /><br />For more general review on the Rio coffee candy, se my review of Coffee Rio Original Coffee Caramels."
"Well,We Got our package from WWW.GizmoAndTaz.com,(an amazon affiliate)opened it up ,I opened up the Lammy Bites container and Taz kinda didn't know what to think he never tried this stuff before. After about 5 minutes kinda playing with it ,Taz decided he wanted another. And now he keeps coming back for more He just loves them ,Gizmo had one, It took him 2 seconds and then he wanted another ,but Gizmo just loves food! Try them out at WWW.GizmoAndTaz.Com You can buy products that real pets like ,tested by Gizmo And Taz. another wonderful product we know your pet will like!"
La Tourangelle makes some really good oils. I like this company alot...try the sesame oil too.
"I do love pork chops but I cook most of mine by frying or in my rice cooker. But this gives me an excuse to try something different. Now this package does not come with a bag to ""shake"" in, so you will need a zip-lock bag. Also one word of warning! You are better off using unfrozen pork chops. Even after defrosting them there will be too much moisture in the meat and your shake & bake coating will be mushy.<br /><br />The breaded coating has a little seasoning, but not too much. Each time I used a package, there was more than enough for all the chops. It baked without burning the breading and was easy to clean up. One of the nice things about the ""shake in a bag"" aspect is that you can add more seasoning if you wish. It will take a little trial and error to get it right for you, but it is always easier to add than to take back."
"This is like a pre-mix with herbs, flour and bread crumbs. It's the same instruction as making your own mix, except that the mix is already done.<br /><br />Dump the mix in a ziploc bag. Then put one chicken into the bag. Shake it up and down a few times until the meat is all coated. It's very easy. Then just put it in the oven. Viola.<br /><br />It's pretty delicious!! The convenience is really what makes it great. This is good for busy people or busy moms during the week."
"This is the Best Peppermint tea, a must buy at a reasonable price. Fast delivery."
"Yum, Yum, I cannot keep away from this stuff!<br />I can down a whole box in one sitting!<br />Thankfully, Amazon sells this stuff in boxes of 10!<br />I'll be customer of Scooby Doo's for a long time to come!<br /><br />Note: it would have rated 5 stars had it less sodium and was not man-made processed snack food."
it is too bad that I can't find this product locally any longer.  It was a favorite in our household.  Now my source is Amazon and I'm just as happy with that as I was before.  It has a great flavor that is long lasting.
"I have the 8ounce popcorn machine with kettle. I have used 10 packs of the popcorn out of the 24 pack case. The taste of the popcorn is great, but at least 25% of the popcorn does not pop. The kernel cather is half full of unpopped kernels after each batch. I will try other brands because to Me that is just too much unpopped kernels."
Raw is eating from your Organic garden of fresh grown fruits and vegetables.It is also all the nuts growing from the mountains that surrounds us through out the land from the forest. Although grown from a tiny little seed that the sun and rain helps in growth it is our heavenly father our creator God who truly makes them grow and should be appreciated for his gift of life to us all and for our home the planet we call earth .<br />I used to be a true vegetarian then I went to only eating Poultry and some fish and eggs through out the years.Now I will eat vegetarian soup made with some beef stock but I don't care for the meat itself and no pork.<br />I am still Organic Alternative and Green but I am slowly trying to go back to being that true vegetarian that I used to be however going raw will take a some time because I have a little hard time chewing with my teeth like my friend but after I get my dentures I will be able to adjust into it .Right now I am canning for winter storage.I have dehydrated my whole garden into green super power food that I added to my barley greens. note if you choose to cook get the Fagor Pressure cooker caner That I got it helps make the meals go quicker and is a lot healthier than baking and Broiling or grilling and never fry food.<br />Well I will let you know how the canning turn out and one day I'd like to make home made all fruit yes that's right not jelly or jam.<br />Hi Again so far so good I have canned 4 pint jars of my home made spaghetti sauce with 4 of Chili and 4 vegetarian soups with 2 red cabbages and they sealed and are ready for winter when things get rough as around here it is hard to get organics so when I do I get all that I can like I just got up at the farmers market this late fall and then I either freeze them or can them and even dehydrate them.<br />So I will keep you up to date but I need to try and get some organic fruits and that is hard to get again around here.<br />well catch ya later as I never say goodbye!Just get this wonderful organic fruit nut and seed mix it has no preservatives and is delicious and affordable and if I can get it you can too. Just remember to soak the nuts and seeds because nature puts some  protective coating on it and they need to break down this to be edible and fit for human consumption.
"I was completely put off by SWITCH KIWI BERRY. Another entry into the already boring sparkling juice market, this flavor not only lacked anything new or interesting, but went a step further in its poor flavor.<br /><br />I didn't really taste kiwi, and the ""berry"" was bland and unidentifiable (raspberry and strawberry, according to the ingredients list); it was, like most of these juices on the market, mostly apple and grape and not much in the way of uniqueness. In fact, the can I tried actually had a metallic flavor to it--I don't know if it was actually picking up the tang from the container, or if it's just the poor flavor profile of the beverage. I really don't care enough to try it again to find out.<br /><br />Also, I don't know why they're calling this line SWITCH. It's probably a marketing thing--they want people to ""switch"" from IZZE or whatever they currently drink. I won't be switching anytime soon, at least not for this boring, low-quality drink."
These are delicious crackers which stay nice and crispy even in humid weather. Unfortunately this particular packaging seems very prone to breaking in transit. They still taste good but I think I will order them in the different packaging where they seem to transport better.
"Trying something new with this coffee. Didn't blow me away but for the price, it's excellent. I don't have anything bad to say about it other than it's a BIG bag and I am mildly concerned with freshness toward the end, but we burn thru beans pretty fast =D"
"Consider purchasing a different product, this juice is contained in plastic #7, one known for BPA and is widely told to avoid, especially for babies!!!"
"My dog loves these treats, but I can't think of any treats my dog doesn't love.  The treats are hard but only takes my 70 pound lab a few seconds to eat.  Based on the other reviews, I will look into this treat containing product from China.  If it does have any product from China I will never buy from this brand again."
"I didn't realize I was getting 20 packets of these chips but I was happy to see them when they arrived.  I love anything sweet potato so I opened the box eagerly and started chowing down.  They are delicious!  My only concern is that I don't really like the texture of anything ""popped"" but because the flavor is delicious I can overlook that.  These chips would work perfectly with many diet plans.  They are very crispy and although you won't confuse them with ""real"" chips they will satisfy that urge for something crunchy.  I'm going to buy them in several other flavors to keep on hand."
"I don't like the taste, which perhaps can be expected -- I'm not a big coffee drinker.  However, my daughter, who likes coffee, didn't like it either and says she'd rather go without than drink it again.<br /><br />My expectations were for a very chocolate/raspberry flavored coffee drink.  What I got was a harsh coffee taste with a slight aroma of raspberry and maybe a hint of chocolate.  I didn't taste the raspberry or chocolate at all."
This product is old. the chocolate crumbles and it looks old. Maybe not stored properly? I could not return item as it is a food item and could not conveniently see how to get a refund. We have had this product fresh and it was wonderful. This was not wonderful by any means
"If you're a regular drinker of orange soda-pop, you might like this Switch orange tangerine carbonated juice beverage.  I thought the flavor was very good and appreciated that it was only mildly carbonated, not so fizzy that I had gas after drinking it.  At 140 calories per small serving, however, this isn't something I would regularly drink.  It's much healthier to eat whole fruit since it's more filling that simply drinking the extracted juice, in part because of the fiber associated with eating whole foods.  Still, this is a healthier option for those who regularly drink sugared sodas."
"This tastes like it has artificial sweetener in it and doesn't taste very chocolatey. The name brand cocoa Kkups are better, or just dumping a regular cocoa packet in a cup and running the water through into it is better."
I have a dachsie mix and I don't want her to get fat as they are prone to do.  This is a good dog food and she likes it so as long as I don't over feed her we should be good to go!  the shipping was quick.  It tends to be pricey no matter where you find it.
These chips are very good and are only 2 points a serving per Weight Watcher points calculator.  I like the Barbeque Popchips best and having them in a single serve bag prevents me from eating more than a 0.8 ounce serving at one time .  This is my second order of chips and I will be ordering chips again.
"I love calypso lemonades, especially the strawberry and ocean blue but I would have to be a fool to order them for 60+ dollars when I can buy the same 12 pack at the corner gas station for $20.  I went on line hoping to find a better price than the $1.69 I was paying.  This is not a good deal unless you are paying $5.12 a bottle"
You get a lot of flavor for 100 calories with these Pop Chips. I hesitated ordering them until I heard Jullian Michaels (trainer from the Biggest Loser) mention it as a substitute for potato chips. So glad that I ordered them.
"We bought a case of these based on the positive reviews, but quite frankly no one who has tried it has liked it at all. It's a bit bitter, and the raspberry is tart tasting. Smells OK when it brews, but so far of all the people who have tried it (wife, myself, friends, relatives), no one has really liked it. So we have a half case of it sitting around collecting dust."
"We have been ordering these chicken jerky treats for a long time with Amazon subscribe and save. My Boston Terriers really love them and get very excited to get their treat every morning. When I opened a bag from my most recent shipment, my dogs refused to take the treat from my hand. They took one sniff and backed away. My son's Lab got very sick from chicken jerky made in China and his vet told him to only buy treats made in the U.S.and I'm going to follow that advice."
"I never eat bars but I do a lot of weight loss programs with hypnosis for clients so I bought a bar in every flavor to taste assuming I would not like it. A friend does marketing for a protein bar and had me taste it and it was inedible!! To my surprise, I thought they were delicious and now recommend it to my clients.<br />I found them satisfying and fun to eat and a fair price point!"
A rich bold taste that maintains smoothness.  No bitter aftertaste.  Have nver had a better K-cup.  If they had six stars this one would receive it.
"This is very good coffee, but it doesn't have as much flavor as the Van Houttes creme caramel.  If your looking for something that has a lot of flavor, go with the other.  If you are looking for something that is more coffee than flavor, this is it."
"The cookies are really good, unlike many airlines' offering(if any). The cookies were well packed, none were broken and were a good value. I have subsequently found them at a national store."
"For what is is, this cookie is pretty good. Does it taste like the soft, under-baked, buttery kind you get from a bakery or your favorite shoppe? No, however it does satisfy a sweet tooth. In my opinion these taste just like a ""less sweet"" version of the chips ahoy brand I ate as a kid."
"Sooo good, I followed some advice and thought outside of the conventional box. Sliced up some cabbage and onion and sprinkled some Mae Ploy chili sauce on it with some Lime juice too, made a nice salad with a kick! also very good with cilantro and daikon."
"This bar is from a company in the UK, which is interesting because this is pretty much how I remember all their food tasting when I last visited.  A chunky, crunchy texture with an odd amount of soft pockets as you bite through is completely ruined by the strange sweetness that arises from whichever ingredient is holding the bar together.  Too dry, too many strange textures that just seem the result of sitting on a shelf too long, probably won't please most people unless you've completely given up on fat, sweet or savory flavors in your diet."
Maldon salt is the best for seasoning proteins before saute or grilling.  It makes a really good finishing salt as well.
i wanted something that had enough meat so my mini schnauzer would want to bite on it however i needed something that could entice him to chew on this rather than my apartment. THis bone was not the solution. There is practically no meat on this bone and after two minutes of chewing he lost interest in it. I threw it away after the first week snce he never touched it again.
"I took one bite of one of these things and had to throw all the rest of them away. The taste is indescribably yucky, sort of sweet yet caustic. The worst part is the TEXTURE! It was like trying to bite through soggy cardboard. Utterly disgusting. I guess if you were trapped in a collapsed coal mine and awaiting rescue and there was NOTHING else to eat, you might choose this over a coal-mine rat, but it would be a hard choice."
"Coffee tastes great, but the cups get torn apart when brewing.  What a mess that is!!  I am quite disappointed because I do like this flavor of coffee!!"
The taste is definately not my thing.  For me it started out bland and as the chill wore off it went downhill from there.  I had to force myself to finish the container.  I did not think that the listed health benefits of the drink made it any better than other drinks of the electrolyte replenishing variety on the market today.  I do like the design of the container and although I was tempted to suggest a straw would be nice it is not absolutely necessary and would just add to the landfills.
"Before you turn to other name brands out there, give these a try. Although the Maui Onion can be a bit salty at times, i can still say these are amongst the crunchiest and tastiest chips I have ever had. Now i have tried both the barbeque and Asian style flavor, but still I must say these are the best. If you are looking for something to snack on that tastes good, these are the ones for you. Its better than the pringle's commercial, since these are harder to put down once you start."
This is available at nearly every gas station gift store throughout Georgia for $3.99.  I buy it at Plantation House gas station.  Plenty of others sell it too.
"Popcorn is very easy to make and comes out ""just like the movies"".<br />A+ on taste and price. If you have the required popper it can not be beat."
"My son just started the Gluten Free diet and I have tried some foods out there just seeing what he will eat. He loved it, I couldn't believe it at first but he kept eating. I'm really glad that I was able to find something that he loves to eat for breakfast. My little girl has starring to eat it to and she says it taste good. I buy it every time I run out cause I love eating it too."
I was at a Walmart in South Carolina and just picked some up. I was traveling and it helped me unwind.
"Love these chips, and I don't even like black beans.  Very tasty.  Yum!!  Plus, good for you!"
"I ordered this collection on 6/9/10 and it arrived on 6/12. Although it was was very well-packaged, this did not prevent the USPS from managing to break one of the tubes. The seller was contacted by email and a replacement requested. As this was a birthday gift and the occasion was only a week away, I offered to pay for expedited shipping. Seller responded immediately stating that a replacement would be shipped ASAP. The replacement tube arrived three days later in good shape. My offer to pay additional shipping charges was declined. In summary, this product is excellent and the customer service absolutely first rate. I highly recommend both the product and the seller."
"I am thorougly disgusted with Betty Crocker for this product (Gluten-free Bisquick), which is a shame, because I do applaud them for their excellent cake, cookie, and brownie mixes.<br /><br />I'm not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten-free baking mix, but for:<br /><br />#1) marketing it as though it's an equivalent to Bisquick and<br />#2) for pricing it so ridiculously high.<br /><br />Ingredients for regular Bisquick: Enriched flour, Partiallly hydrogenated soybean and/or cottonseed oil, leavening, dextrose, salt.<br /><br />Ingredients for gluten-free Bisquick:  Rice Flour, Sugar, Leavening (baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Modified Potato Starch, Salt, Xanthan Gum<br /><br />Notice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten-free Bisquick? Yup, that's right--there's no shortening (or oil).<br /><br />That was the whole point of the original Bisquick--a baking mix that ALREADY HAD THE SHORTENING MIXED IN.  That avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits  That is why people buy baking mixes--for that specific convenience.<br /><br />Betty Crocker has decided to leave out the shortening (or oil) altogether, even though shortening (or oil) is always naturally gluten-free. So they can't pretend it's a safety-for-celiacs factor.  It's a cost-savings to them, pure and simple.<br /><br />Here's the breakdown of what you're paying $5 a pound for:<br />rice flour (99 cents a pound at my local Asian store),<br />sugar ($2.88 for a 5 pound bag at Walmart) ,<br />potato starch (also 99 cents a pound at the Asian store),<br />baking powder ($3.19 a pound at Emergency Essentials),<br />salt ($2 for 26 ounces of Morton's),<br />xanthan gum ($10.45 for 4 ounce on Amazon).<br /><br />Yes, xanthan gum is expensive--but very, very little is needed; a 16-ounce box of gluten-free Bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum--maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum.<br /><br />Betty Crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their ""mix"" at home, while eliminating the major convenience factor (and cost to themselves, but not to you) of their regular baking mix.<br /><br />I don't mind their making a fair profit, especially if the product really WERE the equivalent of regular Bisquick.  But they're gouging us, and being misleading about the product.<br /><br />MAKE YOUR OWN, EASILY, AND FOR LESS THAN 20% OF WHAT THEY CHARGE!<br /><br />Since there's no oil in gluten-free Bisquick, you can easily stir up an equivalent, make 5 pounds (or more!) at a time, with very little effort, and it will keep for several months.<br /><br />Or, if you want a REAL Bisquick substitutes, betterbatter.org has a recipe on the site for a cup-for-cup substitute for Bisquick that DOES use shortening and non-fat dry milk powder.  Or you can use buttermilk powder, or even Vance's dairy-free powder.  It makes 10 cups at a time, stores well, and you don't have to use their gluten-free flour--you can use any gluten-free flour replacement you want (like rice flour and potato starch from your local Asian store, mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum, about 1/2 teaspoon for every two cups).<br /><br />To find the recipe, do a google search of ""betterbatter Bisquick Substitute Master Mix.""<br /><br />Boo on Betty Crocker."
I thought this coffee was really horrible. Had one cup and will throw the rest away because it can't be returned.
"This Assam tea is delicious, and a good deal, especially for organic and fair trade. I will say that I expected it to have a bolder flavor, which I am used to with other Assam teas I have tried. It has the same flavor characteristics of other Assam teas - it just doesn't brew dark and strong even with a lot of leaves in the infuser. That said, I am enjoying this somewhat more delicate Assam tea a lot, and the price was right. The listing promises ""fair trade certified"" and ""certified organic"", but the label on the bag doesn't have any fair trade certification. Hopefully the advertising is correct."
For something that is close to 60 bucks this was very dissapointing. The basket I received looked nothing like whats in the picture. I got a small foil pack of maybe 10 crackers no chocolate candies and a small box of candies that i can get at walmart for 2 bucks. They even changed the contents of the items without notifying me. This will be a NEVER again buy.
"This soda just did not appeal to me it had a very different taste than soda, (that is probably because I have never a Kiwi Berry Soda before), and it was really over sugared.  The carbanation level of the drink is low.  I think I was expecting this soda to be somewhere inline with Jones Soda.  This would certainly not be an item I would want to purchase again."
"I have tried a few of this brand of bread mix in my bread machine and while all have been good I must say to my family and I that this is the best! I have made potato bread from scratch in my bread machine and this is right up there with that. Nice flavor, great texture, well worth the price! I have bought this a few times on Amazon and will continue to do so!"
"We really love Popchips or at least we love the BBQ and the Orginal. Good and crunchy without all the fat and calories. The single serve bags are really great. Costco really has the best price, when they are available there. Since we are a big fan of Jalapeno, we went ahead and ordered them here at Amazon,even though the price was high, and we regret that purchase, the Jalapeno flavor is just wrong. Awful would be the right description. We also tried the Cheddar and that on also failed badly for us. So, we will stick to the BBQ and the Orginals."
I tried vanilla cake mix and pizza crust mix and was disappoined in both.  They had a medicinal bitter taste and even smelled strange.  I threw both items away.
"This is my absolute favorite coffee of all! I have other K-Cups in the carousel and on the kitchen shelf, but they are being totally ignored until I run out of this flavor.  I have recommended it to others, and they all agree that it is delicious."
"We are told to improve our diet. The same is true for our pets. You are most probably not aware what crap meats and fillers are used to produce the most popular name brand foods. They are expensive because of the advertizing. Canidae is not cheap either, but it is because of the quality ingredients. My sons Collie gets it since a few month, and now the fur is much shinier, the dog does not smell and it loves the food."
"Wow!!!  This cat food must have something like catnip in it.  After the first smell and taste, the cats have come at the first sound of opening another can.  My cats seem to really appreciate the taste.  It smells fine to me.  Cat food is cat food, to me, but, to my closest friends, at least my cats, they love this product.  It's a little more expensive than the cat food that I could purchase in a discount store, but, here again, I think that my cats seem to enjoy this a bit more."
"The title just about says it all.  These crackers (crispbread, if you will) are light and airy and come in around 4 grams of carb each.  I cut them into 8 pieces with a sharp knife and use them for dips, as well as ""conveyers"" for cheese and other goodies.  They have become my favourite snack.  Yes, they are bland, but I like the fact they pick up the flavour of what they are served with and don't overpower."
"This was a great sampler of green coffee to roast.  I haven't tried them all yet, but I liked the variety of regions and it really was a great product for a great price!"
This mix is very poorly packaged and breaks open easily during shipping. Nearly a full bag of my order was spilled in the shipping box. 3 bags out of 4 had come unsealed at the top. There were no tears in the packages.
"Thought they were okay at first.  They seemed a little more oily than normal.  By time I got to bottom of bag the last 4-5 ears had a weird molding stuff on them.  Ended up throwing away.  May have just been a bad batch.  Probably came from China.  I think the Chinese have some sort of conspiracy to kill our dogs.  Seems to be a lot of recalls over dog treats that come from China.<br /><br />My newest batch came from some good old boys in Iowa.  I'm feeling a lot better about them.  Few more bucks, but hey, my pets are my kids."
This is the second time I have ordered this tea. It has a wonderful flavor and very smooth.<br />I drink two cups every morning instead of coffee now. I was drawn to this product because<br />of Dr. OZ.
"This food looks just like something you would make for your pet at a Thanksgiving day dinner!  I was impressed with it when I opened the can, and my cats were when they ate it.  It contains nice size pieces of shredded turkey...not too big, making it easy for my kitties to eat.  They have gotten the Tiki cat chicken before and the long stringy pieces in that kept them busy for a little bit and they seemed kind of tough even for me when I would try to break them up.  Not this, I just spooned it into their bowls and they took over from there.  There is liquid around the sides of the food in the center, but the meat/vege mix in the middle is well packed.  I didn't feel like I was getting more liquid than food, like Halo foods so I was happy about that as well.  Plus, through amazon, this is a great price for this quality food."
"Maybe I'm asking too much---but I am trying to find a nondairy organic protein powder that would replace the whey protein I'm using in my morning shakes. Thought I'd give it a try-- my normal shake has the protein powder/shake mix, as well as kale and blueberries, and I usually love it--- with the nutiva hemp shake mix, it was in edible-- adding banana didn't help much-- bad with a really wicked aftertaste. I may be expecting too much, but I'm going to keep looking!!!!!!"
"My German Shepherd is a complete Greenie addict.  She knows when they're in the house.  She knows which cupboard they're kept in.  She knows what time of day she's supposed to get hers.  Her vet compliments her on her pretty white teeth, although some of that credit definitely has to go to the fact that my husband and I brush her teeth with one of those finger-toothbrushes and kiddie toothpaste (no fluoride, so safe if she swallows it), but I do know my dog chews a Greenie at least enough to get pieces between her teeth, and at four years old, she doesn't have the kind of doggie breath that knocks you over if she breathes in your face.  I do believe that some of the ingredients in Greenies help breath from within, so even if your dog inhales his or her Greenie, there's still some benefit.<br /><br />My only complaint about Greenies is that they're expensive.  There's no denying that.  If you do the math on this tub of 17, we're talking about a dollar and forty-seven cents apiece.  So I can see why that might stop some people in their tracks, and I understand.  As for my dog, she's on a limited diet because she's allergic to a lot of things that are standard ingredients in a lot of dog food and dog treats.  I feel like I've been a little bit trained myself, not to bat an eye at this price, and she definitely makes me at least a dollar and a half's worth of happy every day.<br /><br />If you're looking at the Greenies in the 17-piece tub, considering them for purchase, though, I'm guessing your canine is also a Greenie addict, like mine.  You're going to buy them anyway, and if you get the free shipping, Amazon's the place to get them."
We received a box of these at work and the whole package was gone moments after opening it up!  Great biscuits and now I am ordering a couple boxes for a few gifts for people I can't figure out what to get...
"Smooth with a hint of flavor.  Medium boldness yet rich in taste.  Not a ""wake me up"" but certainly enjoyable!"
"I've had luck with this seed and all the other packets I've purchased from Botanical Interests (the company that makes it).<br />Right now, the packet's over a year old and I recently planted another pot and had a high germination rate in about two days and it was about three inches tall in four days.<br />The cats love it. They ate so much I planted yet another pot.<br />Having the grass around deters our cats from gnawing on strange things, like plastic, especially when they are having digestive problems."
My Min-Pin shows absolutely no interest in this item. He is usually very receptive to anything that dispenses treats.
I first tried this chai tea at a beach coffee shop while on vacation.  It was so good that I made my family go back to that location the next morning so I could find out what brand it was.  Big Train!!!  Now I'm hooked.
"This is absolutely the best sauce for making Carolina BarB Q. I,ve looked for a long time and am glad that I finally found the best."
I've been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food. Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains. Since switching I haven't had any issues. It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger/smaller sized dogs.
"I made gift baskets for family members, and this popcorn made an excellant addition. They all loved it, very flavorful."
"Boy did I ever test this out.<br /><br />Each morning after the kids get on the bus, the dogs get a quick walk around the neighborhood park.  They love this, and they especially love the dog moms who bring treats.<br /><br />My dog is a little weird.  She doesn't really like treats -- or rather, she doesn't like a lot of treats.<br /><br />So I thought between my dog and the 5 or 6 others that join the walk, I could give a good review of this product.<br /><br />The consensus:  Every dog liked them!  So that's the main thing that you're looking for when you spend your money on dog treats.  If natural ingredients are important to you, then you can depend on Newman's Own.<br /><br />The one thing that makes me hesitate in giving them 5 stars is that they are big and crumbly.  Crunchy dog treats are good for their teeth I think, but these are 2 x 1 inches big, with a scored line to break them into 2 1 x 1 inch treats.  I found that the scored area was easy to separate, but even so, they are kind of big.<br /><br />So when my dog (a 40 lb mixed breed) ate them, they made a big mess!<br /><br />The other dogs on the walk are the same size or bigger, except for one tiny Shih Tzu.  She wasn't intimidate and tackled the treat with gusto as well.<br /><br />There are about 10 to 15 bars per bag (scored in two, so 20 to 30 treats).  I didn't think to count them when they first arrived, but that's my best guess."
After doing an extensive price comparison we ended up purchasing a double pack from Amazon. So pleased with the Greenies product! Took one of our dogs for his annual exam yesterday and the doctor mentioned TWICE how good our boy's teeth look! YAY!
This worked out great! I ordered 4 boxes! IT was a great deal and  on top of it I used my discover card cbb to pay for it so really it was free too me! LOVE IT best deal I could find anyways! hope you can enjoy it like I Do!
"I read the nine reviews that preceded me and wondered how a product depending on a person's taste could consistently receive five stars.  Is something suspicious here?<br /><br />Nope!  Here's the tenth five-star rating in a row, and I'm tough.  This is the best sauce of its kind (or any kind) I've ever had; and I'm an old guy who's been around.  Just the right sweetness, just the right hotness.  I'd love to soak a chicken in it, as well as dip egg rolls and chicken nuggets.<br /><br />These big bottles won't last and I'll be back for more, fer shure.  Absolutely more than worth worth the little price, this stuff should be standard in every home, along with plumbing.<br /><br />And my sincere apologies to those other reviewers for doubting you."
"I think some reviewers must have got into a bad batch, or maybe did not read the directions.  I found this quite easy to prepare (fill water to the fill line, clearly marked, and microwave for 3 minutes 30 seconds).  The topping should be heated for no more than 30 seconds.  I found that the flavor was very good.  It will not compare with good Chinese take out, but is OK for a quick lunch if you don't have time to go out.  It is listed as having 13 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber.  It has 600 mg of sodium which is somewhat lower than competing brands.  Overall, this is the best brand that I have found.  I usually add something like a fresh apple after the microwave meal.<br /><br />For those worried about the environment, the steamer tray (with lid) can be saved and reused for preparing instant rice or other meals at home.<br /><br />An alternative meal is the Healthy Choice Sweet and Sour Chicken which I have also tried."
"This has to be one of the most disgusting products I have tasted. If you are on the Atkins or low carb diet it is NOT truly low carb. The nutrition information was deceptive and when I tried to return the product (unopened) the return policy does not allow for returns. I threw away the entire order (since I could not return I opened one package and made pancakes...they were so bad I tried to feed them to my dog but she would not eat them either). Avoid this product at all costs! You can buy a much better product by ordering the REAL Atkins pancake and baking mix, which I will do next time! Do not be fooled by this company."
"The oil is light, aromatic and tastes great.  The bottle is opaque, very important to protect the natural benefits of this chlorophyll, and plant sterol rich oil.  I used it on my scalp (hot oil treatment) to wonderful benefits (stopped dandruff when shampoos couldn't!), and cooked a few meals which I enjoyed very much.  I would recommend this without reservation.  Just wonderful."
13 dollars for 24 cups free shipping over 50 dollars is the going rate. These folks are pulling a swiftie
"I've had Amy and Brians coconut water - yum!, Vico's plain in the tetra pack - great! (the ones in the plastic bottle and some in the larger tetra packs are from concentrate - blah and yuck- don't get those!) , and the ones in the glass bottles- green cover- can't remember the name, but pure coconut water -great too.<br /><br />This, one with pineapple- no good.  The added cane juice is superfluous to the natural sweetness of coconut water and pineapple juice.  It makes the water taste 'thicker' and not so healthy.<br /><br />I wish these brands can just stick to the name of the drinks in their ingredients! (i.e. coconut water and pineapple juice! - no more!)"
"This tea is an excellent herbal tea. Love the taste and it's not as weak as most herbal tea is. I used to get it from the Commissary on base but they stopped stocking it so I checked on Amazon. Most wanted to sell by the case but anneeavon sold them in single packages and I swear it said ""and free shipping when ordered from this seller"" above the ""add to cart"" button. I ordered last night and opened my e-mail this afternoon to find they charged me $8.49 shipping for each of the 3 boxes I ordered! And the estimated arrival time is a week away! For that kind of money I'd expect overnight. For that kind of money I could have gotten a couple cases and had change. It's probably my fault for miss reading something but just be aware of the shipping charges on anneeavon products."
I like my coffee strong and is this strong.  I very brisk taste to say the least.  I like it and would order again if in the market for a strong bold coffee.  Very satisfied.
"I love everything about this drink.  It's got plenty of carbonation.  Even without added sugar or artificial sweeteners, it's plenty sweet, without being too sweet.  I LOVE tangerine, and this has a very tangerine-y flavor and aroma.  If you love oranges or tangerines, this is the perfect drink for you.<br /><br />I ordered this from the Vine program out of curiosity, but it will be one of my ""must buy"" items in the future.  I'm also going to buy some for my grandchildren.  Since it has no added sugars, and I know they'll love it, it will be perfect for them."
"Used it a couple of times over the course of a month, and it worked great! Third time, high pitched noise, and no mic signal coming through. Not too surprising, given how flimsy this thing feels. This is apparently a known issue, just look at other 1-star reviews of this product. 'Nuff said!"
"I love this Coffee!  I love that I can sign up with Amazon and get it delivered to my door and not have to search in the grocery stores for it, which half the time I can't find it.  Way to go Amazon, thank you!!!"
This was the first time I ordered this brand. All six cans were rancid. I returned them right away and canceled my subscription. You would think baby food products have a better quality control but I guess some companies do not care.
I don't know what all the positive reviewers here are raving about. I tried Ghiraradelli's premium cocoa mix and found it much too sweet that it was almost unpalatable. And not a very chocolatey taste either. The directions given for one serving are 4 Tbsp of the powder to 8 oz of milk.  Did they meant 4 tsp?  Using their directions would yield a total of 8 cups of hot cocoa -- not very economical for a product with so much sugar.  I had high hopes for this product but was very disappointed.
I really like this. It's not too sweet like a lot of food think they have to be. The texture is spot on. I could eat a handful right out the bag.
"Minor`s has the best beef base i`ve ever tryed. It is not very salty as most beef stocks are. The price is a bit high , but i think it`s worth it. Don`t wast your money on other brands. TRY MONOR`S !!!!"
"Twinings English Breakfast Decaffeinated Tea was exactly what I was looking for.  I loved the English Breakfast tea but needed to find a decaf version.  The taste is great, the price is right, and I'm sold!"
"We use these crackers on a limited basis; they are great for packing in a picnic lunch when others will be having sandwiches, and they add crunch to split pea soup.  They are really great, however, in meat loaf if you can't have gluten -or- yeast, or in meatballs, or any other recipe that calls for crushed crackers."
"Has a funky taste, thought would be interesting to try given the high reviews.  Not sure where these are coming from?  Thought this was the worst coffee I've ever had and no one I've given a cup to thought it was any good.<br /><br />Going to stick with my Cafe Escapes Cafe Mocha.  Their Chai Latte is also very good.  Cafe Escapes is probably the best brand I've had in K-Cups so far."
"First off , It leave a bad taste in our mouth. Next Dose not taste like any thing I ever had .and last it made us sick later that night .<br />there's no use by date on it so it makes one wounder if it is out dated"
"I used the Shake N Bake Pork Pouch on 6 boneless pork cutlets. The product is very easy to use. I poured the contents into a Zip-loc bag, placed the moistened cutlets in one at a time, sealed the bag, and shook. Put the cutlets on a cookie sheet and bake. So easy! It was a big hit with the family, everyone loved how tasty and moist their cutlets were. We will definitely use this again, and try out the chicken too."
These taste really awful. I've tried plenty of choc chip coconut cookies but these are barely edible. My guests weren't delighted when I asked them to try these. Don't recommend.
"I have one cat that even though the cat-nip may be in a large jar he still tries to get to it, putting the jar about like a golf ball if I forget to put it in the cupboard.<br />They all love this Cosmic Catnip. I and my daughter have gotten catnip sometimes that just don't seem to have any 'nip' to it.<br />One can tell a good quality cat-nip by the cats nusseling, eating, and rolling, antics. My cats have all the signs."
This was a big disappointment. There was no raspberry or pomegranate flavor to this. The color is green and not very appealing to look at. However it does work as a great antioxidant.
"I have tried a couple of the Switch drinks now and as far as I'm concerned they have a great flavor. It is important to serve them ice cold. One of the cans I drank sat out of the fridge for a while before I cracked it open. It was still cool, but there was a distinct difference in the flavor from the ice cold version and not for the better. The carbonation is subtle and the sweetness is light and appropriate for the drink. I took off one star for the value of the drink. They are a little pricey for the size of the cans."
"Good quality sprinkles.  Pricing seems pretty decent.  Love the way they make my cupcakes look - takes me back to my elementary school days, long ago!  Only gripes: the ""partially-hydrogenated"" ingredient and non-resealable bag.  By the way, the advertised bag looks completely different than the one you get - it's not black.  Tastes like classic Jimmies too and isn't so sweet that it'll over-sweeten your frosting."
"My dog, a little maltese, loves this product.  She knows she will get it as a reward for doing her business on the wee wee pads.  Works every time to reinforce her behavior. I also received the product in a timely fashion thanks to Amazon."
"We ordered this with a gift card, and it arrived right in time for the holidays. We really liked the smoked turkey breast, and it made the best sandwiches I have had for quite awhile.  The ham was OK, nothing to shout about, but it was good. I thought that the meat was coming boneless, but that was a blessing because the ham bone made for some excellent bean soup after all the meat was consumed. I would order again. One big plus was the speed of filling the order, and the rapid delivery. It was originally stated that when shipped it would have a window of 8 days to be delivered. it was delivered 4 days after I ordered it.  I was impressed, and so was the Wife."
I have fond memories as a kid of going to the swap meet with my parents getting the biggest bag of pork rinds they had and pouring as much hot sauce on them as you could handle. Now that pork rinds can be considered a health snack I bought this box thinking I could have a decent snack every day. Well they pop up great in a large enough microwave. The issue is the seasoning. There is way way way too much salt in the seasoning and adding additional hot sauce makes the experience that much more unenjoyable.<br /><br />I now have these when I am pretty hungry and want to bring compact snack to a place where I know there will be a microwave but I will not be ordering these again once the box is finished.<br /><br />Oh and they aren't hot nor spicy. Just salty.
This is my first time and I can't eat them they are all small hard peaces with only a frw puffie ones. Is there something wrong with my batch? I can't eat them or they would break my teeth am I doing something wrong I only cook them 1 min.
"This coffee is not a true medium roast like Caribou French Roast, Donut House, etc. there was not much coffee flavor at all. I found it to be so weak in flavor that not only did I have to go down a brew size, but I also have to add less milk just too drink it. I will never buy it again. Wish I didn't have 45 more cups to go thru!"
"I've settled on ""Newman's Own"" as my regular cup of coffee every morning.  However, sometimes late in the day I want a decaf cup.  I've tried LOTS of different decaf K cups, but was never as satisfied as I wanted.  Then I thought, why not just get Newman's decaf?  So I gave it a try and sure enough - great flavor.  It's tastes very similar to the regular blend.  So - if you like the original Newman's, then you will also like the decaf."
We love sinus buster tea.  My husband thinks it's great and clears out his sinus' regularly.
"I just made my first mocha, and this is the the most amazing coffee! I can really taste the espresso along with the chocolate. This is going to make a wonderful brew in the mornings. A definite improvement over what I was drinking, and I was drinking some pretty good stuff, and certainly a lot cheaper than Starbucks! I would put this on par with the Starbucks, and they have just raised their prices again. This is where I will be buying my coffee from now on."
"My cat really enjoys these pet greens. We need to break them in half for him or he finds it impossible to chew them. No big deal there though as it makes the bag last longer. I was floored on the huge price increase on these. In september 2011, I ordered these for 3.99 a bag and now in November 2011, they are 7.07 a bag. (same size bag and everything) Wowsa! Hoping that the price comes back down soon. ^..^"
"After a second purchase of a 12-oz Beer Nuts Peanuts 6-pack, I can level no complaints. The shipment again arrived without any adverse settling such as clumping inside the cans. Although the flavor may be a bit duller than my abiding childhood memory of them, this may be attributable instead to the diminished taste buds of a middle-ager. Nonetheless, everyone I know who has tried this product likes it.  Either as a stand-alone snack or as an adjunct to a couple of beers, Beer Nuts is a tasty, if understated winner."
This is the exact noodles used for a main-staple Filipino dish (Pancit) I fix for my family every Christmas.  It's getting harder and harder to find these noodles in my local grocery.  I'm so glad I can find it on-line.  Thank you Amazon.com for making it capable for me to find.
"What can you say about coffee, either you like it or you don't. I liked this coffee, although when I choose to review it I didn't notice it was decaf. That aside, it tastes fine (made in my Keurig) but if you want the kick get the caffeinated one."
"I love KIND bars because they are nutrient dense (no wasted calories), tasty and filling. This variety is nice a crunchy, perfect for mid-afternoon."
"Like the other reviews, this package does not come in the fancy blue box. Instead, it comes in a generic cardboard box. HOWEVER for most things on amazon, it is still significantly cheaper than Walmart, target, or other places so I cant complain. Luckily I did not get any busted cups in my box.<br /><br />This is going in my break room at work. I'll probably order it again. For the amount of cups you get and the cost, it just can't be beaten."
"From the first time I opened the package, a great bold aroma drifted through the house and each time after that. I will definitely purchase this brand again.  Package was vacuumed sealed tight!"
Wow I was so excited to get a product that was like the product I gave my kids when they were babies.  Now that I'm a grandparent I wanted the same for my grandchild.  Every biscuit was broken and not useful to me or the baby.  The pieces were too small for him to hold.  The product will be returned!<br /><br />Another wow! I just spoke to a representative and they will be shipping new product to me asap!  Thank you for the prompt resolution! That's what I like!
"No visible contaminants.  Good uniformity powder, nice color and consistency.  Once opened I found it to be a nice fine powder and would recommend recommend transferring to a tightly sealed container.  I use it for confectioners glazes and improving the durability of shellac."
"This tea was a gift. We are down to the last two tea bags, and I had been unable to find it. Alas, it was on the find anything site-Amazon. This particular herbal blend doesn't sound particularly appealing, but one taste and you will be hooked. A smooth, complex blend. Just lovely."
I got my nestle nestum cerelac and my product was open one of the can was open. I would like to no if there is an reimburse.
"The idea is basically a good one, however, my large Papillon (all 20 lbs of her) could not figure this one out-no matter how hard she tried.  Food is a HUGE motivate her but unless I helped her, eventually she would just carry this toy around and just give up.  I will say that the Tug-A-Jug had ME trained!"
"I've had my Keurig for about two years.  I drink one cup every morning.  Every time I run out of a type of coffee, I buy a box of something different.  This is the first box I have actually thrown away. I would recommend just about any other coffee out there for the Keurig."
"The product image is misleading. The image has the tomatoes as D.O.P. certified, but the tomatoes I received are not...."
"Now the thought of a sweet potato chip might not initially appeal to everyone but I gave these a try and I am glad I did.  They are the right mix of sweet and salty so all those cravings get satisfied in one bite.  They are light and crispy.  If you have ever had a Muncho chip, they are similar in texture to those but not so salty like a Muncho.  You really don't get a strong sweet potato flavor and I at two small bags in one setting with ease.  They are low fat, low calorie (100 calories per bag which is a serving).  They contain natural ingredients like sunflower and safflower oil, sea salt, and organic yellow corn flour.  They are very very good."
"I thought I was buying non pareil candy (like snowcaps), but instead it was a container of sprinkles. I'll find a use for them, but I was hoping for a stocking stuffer (heck maybe I'll make it stocking stuffer andyway).  I would have been better to see a picture of the container- so I knew it wasn't candy."
"I tried both these and just the plain shirataki noodles with zero calories purchased at my local Asian market and I prefer these the best. The plain Shirataki feel like a noodle shaped gummie candy when you eat them...not as hard but too 'slippery'..The House Brand with tofu didn't have that same 'slippery' taste. I didnt find preperation to be that bothersome as a couple of posters have mentioned. I just open them and pour them in a strainer and let the water run over them throughly, flipping them once or twice to get them rinsed well then I toss them in a pan of boiling water for about 15 seconds (they're already cooked) drain and season them however I wish. They have been a great addition to my low calorie diet. I just tried them last night with a packet of seasoning from a box of Suddenly Salad (classic) and I was in heaven...40 calories for the WHOLE bag!"
"The best Jamaican Curry powder there is to my taste. I like to get this non-hot version and then control the spiciness with the addition of fresh scotch bonnet peppers. Outstanding curry powder, I love it!"
"I felt energized within five minutes, but it lasted for about 45 minutes. I paid $3.99 for this drink. I could have just drunk a cup of coffee and saved my money."
"Good product, Good fast Service.  My dog is diabetic and it is hard to find treats that he likes and he can eat.  He really likes these. Gonna try another flavor next time."
My mother is restricted to a low sodium and potassium diet.  This seasoning does has a salty flavor and has added some quality taste to such a bland diet.  Eating eggs and other certain foods without salt is not palatable.  I tried this seasoning and was pleased with the salty flavor.  She really enjoys it and we take it with us when she is in the hospital to season her meals.  We will probably buy the pound bag next time.  Five Stars for this product.
"This product label says that it is ""the perfect balance between juice and carbonation"", but I think the maunfacturer still needs to reduce the carbonation further. Also, I tried a couple of other flavors beside this kiwi/berry, and they are all mostly apple, grape, and acerola with a hint of other things. This particular item is called ""Kiwi Berry"", but there is NO kiwi fruit even listed on the ingredient panel. It is true that no corn syrup has been added, but there are still high sugars. For only 8.3 ounces of liquid, we are drinking 135 empty calories;however, this is a high level of vitamin C. Also, children will probably like these really sweet flavors, so this could be an alternative to offer the little ones."
"Instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl. McCann's Instant Oatmeal holds its texture, has excellent flavor, and is good for you all at the same time. McCann's regular oat meal is excellent, too, but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning. This is the best instant brand I've ever eaten, and a very close second to the non-instant variety.<br /><br />McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)"
"These fruit filled rawhide donuts are wonderful. Our yellow lab goes nuts when we just take one out of the pantry! Best eaten outside or on the kitchen floor, not carpeting,  because little pieces of the fruit do drop out during the feast. Our dog loves the fruity part so much he licks them up!<br />A dog may be man's best friend, but these are definitely a dog's best friend!  Can't recommend them enough!"
"Tastes almost exactly like Diet Dr. Pepper.  REALLY good.  We think this is the best flavor Soda Stream makes.  Also try the diet orange, its very good."
"Taste: Amazing. The honey flavor goes well with the smoked barbeque taste. It's soft, but not too soft. It also has a nice tang and spice to it, but nothing too extreme.<br />Smell: As soon as I opened it, everyone in my section ran up to see what the smell was. I'd describe it as alluring and inviting. Not overpowering or off-putting.<br />Price: For a pound of this quality of jerky, I'd expect it would cost more. Needless to say, you get more bang for your buck.<br /><br />In short, if you want a good jerky to snack on, you can't go wrong with this selection. Do your tastebuds a favor and get this jerky."
"I just received a box of 50 of the Deidrich french Roast. Upon opening the box I saw coffee grinds meaning some kcups broke open.<br /><br />I made a quick call to amzn. Not so upset at losing a few kcups...stuff happens. More upset at the time it would require to wipe the grinds off of each kcup and then find and throw away the damaged ones.<br /><br />AMZN very promptly gave me a full refund and since it was a 'Grocery Item', they said to keep it or throw it away, but they couldnt take it back.<br /><br />Obviously I took the time to clean everything and kept the undamaged kcups.<br /><br />I recently tried EMERILS BIG EASY BOLD and like it very much. Tried around 8 cups to ensure the last was as good as the first.<br /><br />I wont put it at the top of my 'favorite kcups' list, but will say it was very tasty and worth ordering.<br /><br />Nice 'Parisian' taste. Decent kick.<br /><br />4 star coffee + 5 star AMZN CS = BUY IT. You and your guests should like it and AMZN CS ensures if there is an issue, they will make it right."
"I was concerned that this would be pasty tasting, but it really good & mixes up well---great for camping. The kids like it."
"My pug is, perhaps, too spoiled when it comes to treats. I ordered the chicken and the beef and gave her the chicken first. She turned her nose away. I chopped it and added gravy. She ate the gravy. So I cannot attest to the effectiveness of the product."
"Overall I was not happy with the crumbiness of these cookies. They were way to fragile and crumby. There is just too many crumbs in my bed, how am I supposed to sleep like this?"
We've used this food for over 4 years and my dog loves it. It's healthy and keeps her coat shiny and her belly full!
"""Switch"" advertises itself as ""100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't.""  While the ingredient list certainly does confirm the particularly natural recipe required to create this beverage, I'm afraid I cannot endorse it very highly.  I have long been perturbed by drinks of this nature.  Someone aspiring to consume a more natural beverage with no preservatives or other unpronounceable additives should probably altogether avoid the canned, carbonated-beverage front.  Anyone genuinely interested in eating healthy, regardless of the contents of ""Switch,"" probably wouldn't think twice about purchasing a drink such as this.  Instead, a can of this sort advertises to the hypocritical health nut, who has espoused notions of eating organically as a trend rather than as a genuine lifestyle change.<br /><br />The taste of the beverage itself is par for the course.  There is no added sugar, but it's still too sweet.  It's also more than a little too sour, and the fruity nature of it tastes a bit too much like cheap bubble gum.  I also cannot abide the half-hearted attempt at ""carbonation"" that this beverage and others like it undertake; it's carbonation that is a little too subtle to taste like anything more than the undercurrent of sour flavors.  Beverages that advertise themselves as ""carbonated"" should commit to the practice as well as the soda-pop industry has or else avoid the practice altogether; anyone truly interested in drinking healthy probably wouldn't be interested in a carbonated beverage anyway.<br /><br />In short, I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase ""Switch.""  I would drink it at need, when nothing else is available, but I find it to be a contradiction in form and marketing that clearly demonstrates the disingenuous motives of the company that produces it."
I bought these when on sale through Amazon.  Nice crispy thick chips.  Definitely a great buy if you can catch them on sale.
My favorite Flavored coffee!!! This is not available in any of my local stores.  Better price than I have found at any local stores as well.
My 8 yo is a Kettle chip addict so I was so happy to find snack size bags for his lunch!!! Great quality and much cheaper than in the stores!!! Will definitely be buying more!
"I have greyhounds and when they grabbed the rope and the bottle ""chased"" them rattling (kibble inside) they decided they would never touch it again. I try it again with each new foster, and they all do the same thing..."
I love this stuff! I blend up ice and throw some of this salt on it and squeeze some lime juice on and I'm set! I moved to San Diego from Oklahoma and couldn't find this product anywhere so I bought some from her and couldn't be happier!
"This line of products from Dr. McDougall's, is a reasonable solution to those looking for a semi-quick and easy snack or small vegetarian meal. The ingredient list was something that I was fine with, as well as the (relatively) lower amount of sodium. While the other products in this line are good to go after about 5 minutes, the white bean and pasta soup requires 8 minutes, according to the directions. Even then, I notice ""crunching"" of somewhat dry pasta when eating it. Thoroughly stirring the product helps to a cetain extent, but even so it still happens.<br /><br />Also, the lids are glued on TIGHT. Very difficult to remove the paper lid without ripping it. This also wouldn't be an issue, except the directions say to cover the lid with the spoon while the soup is sitting. So have a suitable substitute cover for it.<br /><br />Otherwise the taste is fine, and it does make my lunch meals easier."
Getting 2 boxes of the Classic Twinings Earl Grey decaf k-cups for such a low price is awesome.  Love the taste of Earl Grey and the convenience of k-cups and autoship.
"As many others have noted, these treats made our dog extremely ill. We could not figure out what was wrong at first. Eventually we realized the treats might be making him sick. We stopped feeding him happy hips and he almost immediately got better. We threw them out. Stay very far away from this product."
These are even tastier than the original flavor! Works great in belgian waffle maker too! Why are they not priced right and available by subscription???
"The pricing is quite a bit higher than in the grocery stores.  It is not available in all stores, but I have found it conveniently enough for my purposes."
"I really like this tea & it is so hard to find, I'm thrilled to find it here. The flavor is wonderful, not grassy like some green teas."
"Oh, I really wanted to like this chocolate milk. I love white chocolate and I could not resist the idea of having this K-cup as a special treat from time to time. Unfortunately, it is nothing like a chocolate milk. The colour is pale white and the taste is like pure sugar. If you like the really, really sweet stuff this is for you. But it is definitely not a chocolate milk. I prefer the Swiss Miss K-cups, although they do not come in white chocolate..."
"When I was younger, I used to eat the Maple & Brown Sugar Quaker Oatmeal all of the time- I was torn between it and Strawberries & Cream as my favorites. I went a long while without eating oatmeal and I decided it was time to try this stuff again.<br /><br />First of all, it tastes different. More bland, and more like a sweet pile of mush than any distinct maple or brown sugar flavor. Although they say your taste buds die off as you get older, so perhaps that's just me.<br /><br />My second complaint is the consistency. I have always preferred my oatmeal with milk, so that's how I prepped it. I also tend to prefer relatively pasty oatmeal so I make mine with a bit less fluid and generally let it sit for a bit and set up. I don't know if they're using different oats or what, but even using less milk and cooking it full-time, my oatmeal was still a bit soupy. Letting it set had little effect, so I eventually gave up and just ate it. The oats were cardboardy and chewy, rather than soft and creamy like I remember.<br /><br />All in all, I was disappointed in the turn this oatmeal has taken. Next time I'll try Strawberries & Cream and see if it's still awesome."
"The Beaba Multiportion Freezer Tray is perfect for freezing baby food.  I made my own baby food for my two children, and this is a simple way of getting it done quick and easy.  Plus, it is easy to push the frozen portions out after freezing because the tray is flexible."
"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>(* this review was originally posted for the 3 oz size, a verified purchase by me on Amazon)<br /><br />I purchased three well reviewed brands of catnip for Tristan, my six month old Savannah cat. In the video, I have just placed down three plates of catnip from freshly opened packages. The brands from left to right are <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028HN5A"">Sojos Certified Organic Catnip</a>, in the middle is the product in this listing - Cosmic Catnip (this video review shows the 3oz jar), and on the far right we have <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VNEII0"">Frontier Catnip Leaf & Flower C/s Certified Organic, 16 Ounce Bag</a>.<br /><br />Like the little bear at Goldilock's table, Tristan tries a bit from each plate; at the end of this clip he seemed to have no *overwhelming* preference for any particular brand though. As far as his physical reactions to each (sampled separately), he did not act ""stoned"" nor hyper, he merely scratches on his scratch pad a bit more with catnip than without catnip and gives himself a good stretch. He also strongly prefers catnip infused mice to non-catnip mice and I'm happy to oblige.<br /><br />As as far which *I* prefer, if it's all the same to the cat (and it seems that it is) here's my take on things -<br /><br />The Frontier brand is by far the least expensive at just under fifteen dollars for 16oz. It is slightly more coarse and seems to have a little bit of stems mixed in. VERY fragrant though and turned out to be a close second favorite of the cat reviewing the products. I would definitely buy the Frontier brand again and use it for stuffing toys generously or for ""marinating"" his little cloth mice. Organic and suitable even for human consumption if you like it as a tea.<br /><br />The Sojos brand (1oz can) is the most expensive - by my calculations comes to over a hundred dollars for 16oz!. The description says it produces a ""harmless, euphoric state"" but we saw no evidence of that. Smelled fresh but definitely a milder aroma than the other two brands; had the finest chopped leaves of the three. Hand harvested if that is important you or your cat.<br /><br />With the Cosmic Cat brand, we *may* have a winner.....<br /><br />When the camera was off, Tristan returned to the Cosmic Cat sample several times more so than the other brands. I repeated this little taste test for the next two days and Cosmic Cat had a small but definite edge over the competition. I'd have to say that I agree with his choice; the Cosmic Cat brand leaves are darker and more fragrant than the other two brands. The leaves are also cut just right - not too fine/not too large, and no stems or coarse pieces. I find the Cosmic Cat brand's price reasonable, the storage container is very convenient, and the 3oz* size is enough not to be too little and not so much to get stale and spoil.<br /><br />Hope you find this information useful in choosing for your own cat or kitten."
"I discovered the KIND fruit & nut bars recently.  This is my favorite, good taste and texture, but tends to get very hard if a bit stale.  Nevertheless, I would recommend, especially for someone gluten-free, in which case there aren't enough options."
"I am in my mid 20s, approx height 5'8"". For a good part of my college years I was 220-250lbs, I have since dropped down to 175 (weight loss not related to this drink). I began a rigorous workout routine once I reached my ideal weight to eliminate the love handles. Working full time and attending Masters Degree classes part time, with a few hours a week spent at the gym, really takes a toll on the energy level. Preworkout I drink Jack3d with A-Akg powder. That product let me tell you is the best thing since slice bread. I am big on Monster Absolute Zero, and if that is not available Monster Low Carb. So when I dropped by the Vitamin Shop a few days ago and the salesman who most certainly knows what he is talking about, dudes rock solid, suggested I try Celsius. Handed me 4 cans of this flavor, ""Sparkling Orange"". Upon initial taste results, it reminds me of Soda. I have not drank soda in upwards of 2 years. This brought all those couch potato memories back, till I rotated the can and read the ingredients. That quickly made the lazy days disappear once more. This drink is loaded with the energy stuff you will expect from a drink such as monster, BUT with a change of pace in taste. It does not taste anything like a redbull or monster or even rockstar, this unique taste separates it from all the energy boosters I've tasted in the passed. Long story short, this does pack a kick. Today is a perfect example, I worked a full shift on 8 hours of sleep, 8am-4pm, worked out at the gym from 9pm-11pm, slept 2 hours, and got up to go into work at 4am, pickup a few hours of overtime, drank a can and I am feeling GREAT. The energy boost is enlightening. So if you are looking for a good energy booster at a better price than most, this is it for you. I love Monster Absolute zero, but it is more than twice the price per can."
"Since getting my Keurig machine I have been experimenting with variety of K-cups.  I didn't get this on amazon but caught it on sale at the local market.  It's a good basic cup of coffee.  While trying to figure out flavor preferences (with things like caramel, blueberry, etc.) it's nice to have a basic that you can rely on.  Some of the flavors aren't strong enough and some of the other brands or roasts are way too strong.  Nantucket blend is a happy medium."
"I like it, but it seemed to be lacking something.  It was not as good as the Light Maple Brown Sugar.  I do think the serving was a little small also."
"I have tried and enjoyed The Switch black cherry flavor, but their kiwi-strawberry left a lot to be desired.  To my palate, the flavor seemed a mix of floral and medicine-y, not very pleasant.  I appreciate the fact that they are trying to push a healthy alternative to soda (basically carbonated water and fruit juice), but they need to get the flavor right."
I add this to my morning steel cut oats and its awesome! A little in my smoothie is really good and I also put this in my Banana Bran muffin recipe too !
This is another of Marshall's products where you control the taste and the flavor is the greatest out there.  No salt products from them are the greatest for the knowledgeable cook or the amateur whom can add a little or more salt to their taste.
"After doing numerous googles looking for Chipsters, one of my favorite childhood snacks, some reported that this product was very close to them. I disagree. About the closest flavor to the Chipsters so far would be Munchos, but still not the same. If you are conscious of diet, these will probably due."
"Worst toy ever!<br />-cheap plastic, not strong<br />-rope too thick prevents treats to fall out<br /><br />I have a super smart border collie and he got frustrated with that thing. Not because it's hard to understand how it works just because it's very hard to get the treats out even for me, even when he shakes it. The rope (too thick)prevents the treats from falling out.. and even when I removed the rope, the shape of the bottle makes it difficult as the kibbles roll inside but that's pretty much it, they barely ever get passed the neck. Which makes it a very expensive useless toy, I could have just use a small empty water bottle for no cost!!<br /><br />DO NOT RECOMMEND!<br />Try the kibble nibble instead, I have one and it's way better even if sometimes the treats fall out of it too easily. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005JU18S4"">Busy Buddy Kibble Nibble Food and Treat Activity Ball</a>"
"I cannot say how much I love Kettle brand potato chips. Kettle brand has a large variety of unique flavors, and the quality of the chips themselves blows all other potato chips out of the water. The ingredients list is printed on each bag and the only thing really bad for it is the oil they are frying the chips in. I love that these aren't filled with nasty chemicals. I ordered the cheddar and sour cream krinkle cut ones which are great but I was torn between the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048IFUSC"">Kettle Brand Potato Chips Fully Loaded Baked Potato, 2-Ounce (Pack of 24)</a> and the Jalapeno flavor. While I know the jalapeno flavor is good but this is way better. They include liquid smoke instead of actual bacon which I'm fine with since I've a vegetarian. I ordered this to give to guests coming from out of town for my wedding this spring and I can't guarantee how many I will have left. My fiance and I love these. The packaging is perfect for anyone who is giving these to kids to take for school lunches, or handing out in gift bags, even just for portion control."
"Received in a timely manner and in good condition. My Mishka is a little spoiled (I cook her meals when I can afford it, buy her wellness kibble when I can't) but she ate this willingly. I bought this because it qualified for overnight shipping, unlike the much heavier wellness bag, and she was almost out of kibble. I'm happy with the compromise."
The tea was very weak and not that good. Now I have six boxes of tea I that no one in my family likes.
"FIRST THOUGHTS: BRINGS BACK OLD MEMORIES<br /><br />When I recently tried these little wafers I recalled when I worked in an office nearly 20 years ago. Whenever the Director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 O'clock. He usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. I came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him - I guess they really admired him. These 'Nabisco Oreo Thin Crisps, Baked Chocolate Wafer Snacks' would have served his purposes much better than the saltines, but I would rather he have more of his old favorites.<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: NICE FOR A DIETER AT COFFEE BREAK TIME -- BUT NO CREAM & SUGAR PLEASE<br /><br />Basically, this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something in-between meals and they don't want it to be a 600 calorie confection. That's why the biggest print on the label says, ""100 calorie packs"" -- 4.5 inches across!<br /><br />WHAT'S THIS STUFF ALL ABOUT: ENRICHED FLOUR + SUGAR + ""ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS"" & ""ARTIFICIAL COLORS"" & A LITTLE CANOLA OIL<br /><br />2 GRAMS OF FAT & 9 GRAMS OF SUGAR in a 23 GRAM PACKAGE = 100 CALORIES<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: NO PRETENSES -- SIMPLE LEAN SUGAR WAFER WITH THE USUAL ADDITIVES<br /><br />As diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood-sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. When the Director didn't find any saltines around the office he'd head straight for McDonalds and the rest was history."
"Great natural treat for my cat, whose health I want to keep strong for many years. And he loves them!!!"
"I've had a lot of San Marzano tomatoes in my day, both fresh and canned, and typically they are the best tomatoes on the planet. I opened the first can from this order, and the tomatoes weren't very good at all - nothing like I was used to. I later noticed that the can does not have the ""D.O.P. Certified"" label, like the photo on the Amazon page does. These tomatoes are not D.O.P. certified, and are not real San Marzano tomatoes. They are a cheap imitation.  The seller tried to mimic the label of real san marzano tomatoes so they could sell them for a higher price. I would recommend you stay away from these.  You can get better tomatoes for a fourth the price at your local grocery store."
"This has renewed my addiction to coffee, and tea. Once set up(~5 minutes) and warmed up(~2 minutes) you can have a hot cup of coffee, tea, cocoa, or a few other things in just a matter of seconds! This really has changed the game. Would you rather a fresh hot cup of coffee or that last cup from the bottom of the pot that's been on the burner for an hour? This allows you to have that fresh hot cup every time.<br /><br />I've read some reviews that talk about it making too much noise. I don't see what they are talking about. The only think I can imagine would be when the pump sucks the water into the heater. While noticeable, that sound is a dull hum at best. I can't see it being a reason not to get one of these.<br /><br />With so many great options for coffee and more this machine has been in constant use since it arrived. I'm trying out different types of coffee one cup at a time, and enjoying more tea than I've had in years. Thank you Keurig for making a product that is trouble free and simple to use."
We discovered it  in our last journey to London. We really loved it  and so we purchased it at Amazon as soon as we saw it. Travel to London was more expensive!
"I am a black licorice fan, and this is the best I've ever eaten. It's delicious! I was able to buy a case at a very reasonable price and share it with my friends that like black licorice too."
"If this is supposed to be a top notch dog food, my dogs sure don't think so. There is a very odd smell to this food, it almost smells as if it is bad. Same smell came from the Bison flavor as well.  My dogs won't eat it.  Obviously other dogs like it otherwise they'd be out of business. Sorry I wasted money on 2 cases of this stuff."
"These seeds grow very easy, one seed pack grew about 7 little pots. I would grow using a few seeds about every 4-5 days in 2 separate little pots for my cats so they never was without. A great buy."
My mother always made her chili using the French's Chili-o Mix by following the directions and using Ranch Style beans. It is the perfect combination of flavors and a chili tradition for our family. I have had a difficult time finding it in my local store since I relocated. Luckily it is easily located thru Amazon and our taste buds are not deprived. It is the perfect blend of spices!
"Petite Cuisine Chicken Pot Pie for Cats: This is an expensive bit of tomfoolery for my kitty cats. When the humans in the house get a special bit of food, the kitties do also. They are my all day companions and when the humans celebrate so do the cats.  The biggest CON for the product is the cost, which depending upon the specials in force at the time make it about a dollar a can which is 3 oz--filet migion anyone??? But on the PLUS side, the kitties lap up the entire can without the usual bits of this and that left over depending upon how well they like the daily fare. ALSO, both of my cats are male which makes them prone to urinary tract problems. In addition to pure white meat chichen, this has a watery sauce with it which they ""slurp"" right up which adds to their daily fluid intake. After reading many books on cats and kittens, I decided that these male animals needed at least half of their daily fare in ""wet food"" to avoid urinary type probs. This really helps as cats are not noted fluid imbibers unless the fluid is sauce based (or is my lemonade which they make sure to contaminate--UGH!). So I love them and spend a little extra from time to time. The humans in the house make out well too!!!! Best wishes to all and hope this helps. December 2008"
"POPCHIPS CHILI LIME POTATO is a crunchy potato chip, that is not your grandfather's potato chip.  First, for the positive comments.  The chips are salty, but not so salty that you will experience a pressing urge to drink a cup of cool water.  The chips are crunchy and crisp, but they do not produce several fragments when you break them.  In other words, they break very cleanly.  Although the chips are a new product, they resemble a traditional potato product where thin-sliced aged potatoes are first dipped in low temperature oil, allowed to cool, and then dipped in a high temperature oil, where the high temperature provokes expansion resulting in a puffy potato.  This product apparently uses this type of technology, not for ordinary sliced potatoes, but for potato chips. Best of all, this product is tangy with a slight hotness and a slight lime flavor.  The chips are round, perhaps resembling a deflated bean bag chair, and sprinkled with red dots.  The product is pleasant to the eye.  For those who become addicted to this product, there is little need to worry about calorie overload.  The reason you don't have to worry about calorie overload is that the ratio of carbohydrates to fat is about 16 grams carbs/3 grams fat.  And now, for the negative comments.  I have no negative comments about the POPCHIPS CHILI LIME POTATO product."
This storage drawer fits in perfectly on our countertop. We can either set the Keurig on top of it or beside it and still store a large amount of k-cups where people can get at them easily. Totally satisfied!
I have been buying Greenies for years - this company had the best price - very satisfied!!<br />Shipment arrived faster than promised and packaging was original from manufactuer.
"I've been using these chews for years now and they truly do what they say they do. I have all my dogs using them except for 2 pomeranians that have allergies. Those are the only 2 that have to have their teeth done yearly at the vet. The others teeth stay white and tartarless!<br />The HEXtra chews seem to work better for my dogs than the regular CET chews, but regular do a suitable job, just have to take them in now and then for a cleaning."
"the best, tastiest and fast making ice tea by the glass, does not leave an after taste, like a delicate summer breeze in a glass, fresh ice tea anytime of day or night, great for company"
"I have a new Akita puppy, and bought the Canidae ALS for him since I couldn't get the breeders type of food in my area. After transitioning him to the Canidae, his stools were loose and yellow. I looked on-line, and saw that Canidae switched their formula, and my puppy's symptoms were mild compared to some I read about. I immediately switched my puppy to Wellness Puppy, and everything has been coming out fine since."
"I wasn't sure what these consisted of when I ordered them,but I was very pleased w/the taste & the texture... Very sweet w/a kind of sugary marshmallow texture :)"
"I have tried around 4 other flavors of Yogi. I feel this is the best. It has a nice light, smooth and soothing taste. My experience is first time you taste it may not be so inviting. But the taste develops as you keep having it daily. Moreover by the contents you can trust it is healthy too."
This comes in a case of 24 so I bought one can locally before ordering the large amount.  Good move!  I have 3 cats and none of them would eat it. This review is for the mature gourmet beef entree. Haven't tried the other favors yet.
"This popcorn is bangin'... most microwave cheese popcorn tastes off somehow. Not this, it must be the cheese packet, tastes so yummy!"
"Tasteless, basically says it all.  I love tea.  Drink it every day.  I found this undrinkable.  Great packaging, but not a good tea for me."
"It is the best coffee I ever tasted.  I usually add a little sugar and French Vanilla cream, but it is delicious black.  I gave a bag of coffee to a friend and she was amazed at the great taste, flavor and aroma.  I will be ordering this coffee for holiday gifts."
We didn't care for this product at all. It seemed to have a funny after taste to it. Wasn't worth the cost. We were unable to even finish using what we purchased it was that nasty.
"<span class=""tiny""> Length:: 1:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>(* this review was originally posted for the 3 oz size, a verified purchase by me on Amazon)<br /><br />I purchased three well reviewed brands of catnip for Tristan, my six month old Savannah cat. In the video, I have just placed down three plates of catnip from freshly opened packages. The brands from left to right are <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028HN5A"">Sojos Certified Organic Catnip</a>, in the middle is the product in this listing - Cosmic Catnip (this video review shows the 3oz jar), and on the far right we have <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VNEII0"">Frontier Catnip Leaf & Flower C/s Certified Organic, 16 Ounce Bag</a>.<br /><br />Like the little bear at Goldilock's table, Tristan tries a bit from each plate; at the end of this clip he seemed to have no *overwhelming* preference for any particular brand though. As far as his physical reactions to each (sampled separately), he did not act ""stoned"" nor hyper, he merely scratches on his scratch pad a bit more with catnip than without catnip and gives himself a good stretch. He also strongly prefers catnip infused mice to non-catnip mice and I'm happy to oblige.<br /><br />As far as which *I* prefer, if it's all the same to the cat (and it seems that it is) here's my take on things -<br /><br />The Frontier brand is by far the least expensive at just under fifteen dollars for 16oz. It is slightly more coarse and seems to have a little bit of stems mixed in. VERY fragrant though and turned out to be a close second favorite of the cat reviewing the products. I would definitely buy the Frontier brand again and use it for stuffing toys generously or for ""marinating"" his little cloth mice. Organic and suitable even for human consumption if you like it as a tea.<br /><br />The Sojos brand (1oz can) is the most expensive - by my calculations comes to over a hundred dollars for 16oz!. The description says it produces a ""harmless, euphoric state"" but we saw no evidence of that. Smelled fresh but definitely a milder aroma than the other two brands; had the finest chopped leaves of the three. Hand harvested if that is important you or your cat.<br /><br />With the Cosmic Cat brand, we *may* have a winner.....<br /><br />When the camera was off, Tristan returned to the Cosmic Cat sample several times more so than the other brands. I repeated this little taste test for the next two days and Cosmic Cat had a small but definite edge over the competition. I'd have to say that I agree with his choice; the Cosmic Cat brand leaves are darker and more fragrant than the other two brands. The leaves are also cut just right - not too fine/not too large, and no stems or coarse pieces. I find the Cosmic Cat brand's price reasonable, the storage container is very convenient, and the 3oz* size is enough not to be too little and not so much to get stale and spoil.<br /><br />Hope you find this information useful in choosing for your own cat or kitten."
SPECIAL K IS BATTING 1000 IN THE SNACKS DEPARTMENT BUT ESPECIALLY WITH THESE CRISPY CRUNCHY DELICIOUS CHIPS. SOUR CREAM + ONION WAS SPOT ON + GREAT. THESE HOWEVER HAVE A LITTLE SPICY SIGNATURE I'VE NOT TASTED B4. EXCELLENT! A BIT OF ADVICE. COUNT OUT THE 27 CRISPS AHEAD OF TIME + THEN PUT THE BOX ON A HIGH SHELF! ..HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!
"I like it as a straight espresso shot - great aroma, not bitter with subtle sweetness, but not as much for cappuccino. Supercrema in my opinion holds up better for those who like to add milk to their espresso drink. I don't think these beans will work at all for those who like latte. I wish all these would come in smaller size because I normally go through 1 Lb of coffee every month and this bag will last me two months."
"Have had this before, good smooth coffee made  quickly. Not the best (there are better) but its better than most.Ordered it here because its cheaper. Came very quickly and packed well."
"Just awful!  I thought food was supposed to taste good!  I had to eat ice cream afterwards to get the taste out of my mouth, it's that bad."
"These are delicious cookies. what can I say, except that they're crisp with a brown buttery flavor.  They're versatile, as they make great cheesecake crusts.  I'm still playing around with creating different recipes, but I need to hide them.  Otherwise, my family eats them like potato chips."
"I got a tiny twig! No rocks or decorations...doesn't even look like a tree!! Not happy!  They have pictures of bonsais that would be good for a gift, but I would be really embarrased to give the tree that I got as a present!"
this is just the perfect thing to end a tired day.  the taste is smooth and warm and creamy.  i find that i look forward to having a cup while i read for a few minutes. what a treat.
"Seeing the word ""tangy"" on the front of the box, I had high hopes of a refreshingly tart, vibrant raspberry herbal tea.  Instead I found it less like tea and more like a weakly flavored cup of liquid raspberry J-ello!  Leaving the bag in longer doesn't help either.  The first cup I made, I got distracted and the bag was left to steep 30 minutes before I took a sip.  I'll be switching back to Tazo Passion as soon as I finish the box."
"I bought this tea cause I had consumed the one from the bottle and I like that one.<br />However in tea bag is not just tasting totally and completely different, but additionally tastes really<br />horrible... believe me, I even tried to give it to my co workers for free after they tried it and they did not accept it.<br />In my opinion It tasted like Serum :s. Now I have 100 tea bags wasting space, probably soon they'll go to the waste bascket.<br /><br />It's sad... I thought it would taste like the bottle or at least close, but totally a disappointment."
"I received this product for free and was quite excited to try it out.  I have a child who has a variety of food intolerances and Namaste brand products have been a Godsend to our family.  Unfortunately this ""Say Cheez"" product is terrible and my child wouldn't touch it.  Normally, this isn't a problem when my child tries new foods, but I couldn't even stomach it!  It is NOTHING like mac & cheese.  The sauce isn't even creamy?!?!  Very disappointing."
"These seeds are perfect for tossing into yogurt or smoothie.  But you must consume quickly.  The seeds draw moisture quickly causing them to swell.  You will be picking them from your teeth for days if you do not drink with a staw.  I have taken them straight from a spoon and washed them down with a glass of water before my ""light"" lunch and they really do give a feeling of fullness.  Do to a severe sensitivity to caffeine and any sort of stimulus, I wanted to try something natural that would not raise my pulse, quicken my MVP heart and just not make me overall jittery.  These do the trick.  When I drink a meal replacement drink, I still feel hollow inside and want to snack.  By adding a full, rounded table spoon of seeds after a few minutes, I feel nice and full.  These can be tossed into a powdered drink, a canned ready to go drink (milkshake type) and even into a vitamin water.  But believe me when I say, you must consume quickly or you will need a spoon, they turn into a jello consistency quick....which actually is not bad either.  You can bulk up a 100 calorie pudding snack by stirring in a teaspoon or so.  Many ways to get creative with the Chia seeds.  Enjoy!"
"I love Crystal Light. My mom used to give it to me when I was a kid, instead of buying sodas. I didn't drink it for a long time and when I saw this I bought it as an alternative to buying diet sodas. Let me just say, DELICIOUS!!!! I make sure my water is absolutely cold before I mix in the crystal light and it is SOOOOO refreshing. My favorite is the wild strawberry. It reminds me of the strawberries my mom used to grow. I'm going to buy three more of these. Hopefully it will last me till the summer but I doubt it."
"I generally assume everything from the School Cafe is the cheapest they can get without any regard for taste. However, as I was out of my own tea, I decided to steep a cup and I was extremely pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It was excellent, and I am going to buy a couple of boxes at least."
"Nice Aroma, very tasty and the crema....<br /><br />very smooth coffee with no coffee shakes to follow even after 6 shots of espresso in the mornings."
Everyone loves Pocky and if they say they don't they are lying lol. The Pocky arrived in good condition with minimal melting and very few broken pieces.
I love snacking on cheezits and a good (or better) aged cheddar cheese together with a mustard and sliced pepperoni.
"I like these peas for having nothing but the pea in the can. Read the sodium levels on a can of beans these days, might as well drink sea water. Yes these are bland, no bacon, salt or artificial flavors, simply peas. A pinch of salt, some spices, rice & hot sauce or mayo like my granddad adds and I can make lunch or dinner from a can of these puppies. I keep these to wolf down on days I have gone too long without food and need something fast. Stock trading does not lend itself to eating healthy or at all most days. Canned blackeyes are fast, filling and healthy but will not rock your world flavor wise. For me they fill the nutrition hole and keep junk food from finding my mouth, that alone makes them 5 star."
I always have this in my house. I drink it as is or my favorite is mix with sprite. Oh So Good!! I have some every day. I do not mind the larger bottles as I use so much of it. Bring it on!
"I was very disappointed with the quality of the chocolate.<br />If you want the BEST, I've found that Ethel M.'s chocolate liquor barrels are incredibly good - but you WILL pay the price!"
"I've been a fan of this stuff for years.  Make sure you stir it up after you pull it out of the microwave since the grease seems to float to the top.  It is quick, easy, and makes for a tasty lunch when you are short on time or don't feel like going out for lunch."
"Great price for what you are getting.  Recording via a USB port ROCKS!!!! The only thing that could maybe be improved is the durability.  It feels like a toothpick in your hand.  It may be more durable than it feels, but I'm still going to be very careful with it.  But, for the price this is only a minor gripe.  Great product, I would recommend it to anyone."
"This is the most expensive loose tea I have purchased so far.  I have not strayed from the Davidson's loose bulk here on Amazon at such a great price but thought I would give this one a try.  The tea itself looks nice - partial leaves, better quality leaves than what I had seen so far out of other cheaper teas.  The taste is decent as well.  I do however have a HUGE problem with stray hairs in my loose tea.  The first time I scooped some out and noticed a long hair (and not the color of mine) in with the tea I was grossed out but thought ""Hey it happens"".  The second time I found another hair down further in the bag (oddly enough a different color and longer) it completely repulsed me.<br /><br />This isn't bad tea, but I would say there's a quality control problem in filling the bags.  Needless to say that I won't be buying this brand any more and back to Davidson's cheaper (and hair free) tea for me!"
"They're ok I guess but each bag has about a pound of salt in it. You'll find yourself brushing away salt from each piece just for it to taste somewhat decent. Also, no matter what you set the timer on the microwave, you will have little burn/hardened pieces. So you're not even getting a whole lot out of one bag."
"I was excited to have some seasonal items out of season, but I didn't know they would be three seasons old. They were so hard that I couldn't eat a single one and I had to throw them all away."
"I love this tea.  It is my favorite ever.  I first bought a box when vacationing on Maui, then couln't find it at any of my local stores when we got home, so had to order it online.  I would no doubt drink this tea exclusively if not for the reviewer who thinks it almost killed him!"
"I didn't know what this would taste like, but I'm so glad I ordered it.  What a perfect cup of yummy coffee for a cool summer morning!"
"I purchased this item to bake some low carb cookies for a diabetic friend.  This works well for that, however, I did find that there is another brown sugar alternative that is calorie free.  Both options worked well in the cookies."
"Let me tell you that I was totally impressed with the ingredient list on these treats.  The first thing I always do is check out the crude fat content and the ingredients to see how good this will be for my baby.  I have a Toy Fox Terrier and the last thing I want to give her is something that might cause her to get sick.  These cookies are quite big so you will need break them up and they are a bit on the hard side but Max loves them.  Just in case you don't know, one of those little cheaper cookie treats is equivalent to a large Snicker's bar to a toy dog breed.  That's far to much sugar.  They are pretty much all natural so I'm able to give her something I would not otherwise.  Newman's makes wholesome good for aniamls products and that should be your main concern when buying.  They are a bit more expensive but worth every bit when it comes to the health on our baby.  Better than having to worry about vet bills with using cheaper dog products."
"I love Drostes cocoa. We have many food allergies and cannot use the prepared baking chocolate, so I bake with cocoa. There is a huge difference between Drostes and the other brands. When I take baked items (usually brownies that are out of this world) to events, I label them to let others with food allergies what the ingredients are. Some people won't try them because there are no milk, no eggs, etc in my brownies. However, those who do try them keep coming back for more and say mine are the best. I have to agree, and I give the credit to Drostes."
"Maybe I got the runt of the litter, but when I opened the bag, the foul musty/moldy smell hit me in the face. Even though the label (which was just a printed sticker as opposed to something stamped on the bag itself) said good until 1/2013, there was no doubt that the food had gone bad. Very disappointing."
"My recommendation? Get a juicer and make your own, or try Odwalla. The taste was bitter, and the smell was strange and foul. The label says ""Enriched with organic lemon juice"" and that is not pure carrot juice in my book. Maybe it was the lemon I tasted, I don't know. I had about three sips and couldn't stomach it."
Sadly i got really excited when i saw this and the toy these go into that i bought a few flavors and the toy ASAP. She isnt into them =[ hopefully she comes around and starts to use it but we will see. If she does i will make an update!
"I ordered the medium, which is actually a medium/large and it is too big for my Scottie.  I found after receiving this from Amazon that Petco suggests the small size for dogs the size of beagles, cockers, and shelties. I think  Scotties would fit in that category.  He doesn't show much interest in the toy even with treats in it.  I'll get the small and see if that makes a difference."
I sent two Babkas to a friend as a thank you.  He is a big Seinfeld fan so he was thrilled to get both a cinnamon and chocolate babka.<br /><br />He said the babkas were delicious!!!
tastes vaguely of bad fish. Good idea but it's a bit off putting. Nothing can replace real bacon plus real mayo.
"My dog really enjoyed these snacks.  She has Kidney problems so I am warry of giving her any old treats.  I trust the Newman brand and have faith that they don't put fillers (such as wood chips or other low quality ingredients) into their products.  Let's face it, our dogs are part of our families and we should feed them high quality foods and snacks.  These are on the larger side - I prefer smaller treats for my dog because she is overweight.  Overall a great quality - check the ingredients listed in case your dog has any allergies."
"I have been receiving this product from Amazon for more than a year from Amazon, because I can't buyit around here.  Not only does it taste good, the flaxseed and pumpkin seeds have helped me raise my good cholesteral."
"Although the coffee had no reached the expiration date, I felt this coffee was borderline stale.  I'm not sure how far out these products are packed to the expiration date, but wished it would have been fresher.  As these little packets are somewhat expensive, I was hoping for more."
"I was excited to buy these ""chips"" and try them out since they are supposed to be a healthier alternative. But these things are super super salty.  What it lacks in oil, it makes up for in salt.  I would not consider these things healthy at all.  I bought these for my toddler but I didn't know why he only ate 2 pieces before giving up until I tasted them myself. I even opened a 2nd and 3rd bag just to make sure the first bag wasn't just a fluke.  Don't waste your money on these.  Stick w/ the baked chips!"
"I love coffee and I usually drink dark roast.  This coffee is as good as any I have tasted.  Apparently, you do not have to sacrifice taste to get low acid. I gave some to my brother-in-law who has acid re-flux.  He was impressed and would consider buying this brand in the future.  Now he can have a cup of coffee late in the evening instead of abstaining to avoid an uncomfortable night sleep."
"I ordered this for my wife as it was reccomended by our daughter.  She has this almost every morning and likes all flavors.  She's happy, I'm happy!!!<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5QW8"">McCANN'S Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>"
"This product was awesome the first couple months, I was convinced I was over any potential ""defective period..."" Well, after caring for it well and giving it no reason not to work, it of course stopped working for me. I now can't use it for anything serious. Anything I record that is profound or important runs the risk of cutting out half way without giving any warning leaving me with half a recording of audio and half with crickets. There must be some crappy design inside the tube that prevents establishing a solid connection, I'm just happy it's not my $100 blue microphone! Don't waste your money on the icicle, it's productive ability has an expiration."
Had been feeding my 3 hounds Purina One (which they liked) and thought I'd try this since it's not much more and I liked the ingredients. They LOVE it and I plan to order more in the future!
"The price is right. You're not going to find large containers like this is stores and you can use this in just about every recipe.<br />I use it in everything from buffalo wings, teryaki skewers, jerky, sausages, on eggs, etc. . .<br />It's spicy but it doesn't have an overpowering flavor.<br /><br />If you want to view some recipes, subscribe to foodwishes on youtube or visit his blog. He got me hooked on the stuff."
"this product does help to cleen the teeth, but doesnt really help to get rid of the bad breath of my pom..But still a good buy, cause the size is perfect for small breed dogs"
"Being the candy-lover that I am, I wanted to buy some cute lollipops that I could pull out of my bag and enjoy whenever I felt like it. For that purpose alone, I'd give them five stars. However- at first lick, the lollipop has a slightly off taste; but this goes away after a minute and is not unbearable or disgusting in any way. I laughed quite a bit at the reviews of outraged individuals because the lollipops are 'Made in China'- I'm not dead/dying/sick. Good enough? As well, the text on the wrapper is fine- I wasn't repulsed by it and I'm not afraid to share. I'd only rewrap them if they were for presentation rather than eating.<br />The colors are not as vivid as in the picture, and the lolipops are not glazed- so they do not have that shiny look that many others have. None of mine came broken, and they were well-wrapped. I'm happy with my purchase and plan on eating them all(minus the few that I share with friends), but I'd try something different next time."
"i love chicken teriyaki and sesame chicken heatlhy choice meals, so i figured i would give this a try. BIG MISTAKE. the rice does cook the be nice and fluffy but the sauce and chicken taste horrible. for one there is not enough chicken in it and the sauce was far to overwhelming. had trouble swallowing it and threw the rest away. Yuck!!"
"We give our dog one of these per day to help clean her teeth.  I don't really know how well they work, but she loves them, and so we're happy to give them to her.  Amazon has absolutely the best price on these - I've looked extensively.  When we call ""greenie"" she comes running, and takes it to her special ""greenie chair"" to enjoy!"
"This brand is by far the best K cup hot cocoa not that that says much, but it is thicker and less disgusting than the rest."
The Beaba freezer tray is flexible and very easy to clean. It has seven slots which is a good amount of storage for a week worth of 2oz puree portions. I make a lot of food for my 9 month old boy and I like to use this tray to store various fruit purees. The top closes securely and feels like it wouldn't come off if dropped.
Besides tasting great. This water has minerals that are missing in other waters and many of the foods that we consume that are grown in mineral depleted soils. You can feel the difference when you drink Destiny in how you feel hydrated.<br /><br />Thanks Destiny
"I was already a big fan of the Popchips Salt and Vinegar flavor, so when I saw that they were coming out with a Chili Lime flavor I was so excited to try it! The flavor does NOT disappoint - tangy, spicy, and a dash of sweet. This is my new favorite ""chip""! Now, if you've never tried Popchips before, just be aware that the texture is different than regular potato chips, somewhere between a traditional chip and a rice cake. It can throw off die-hard potato chip fans, but if you just want something crunchy and awesome tasting, without as many calories and fat, then this is going to be your new favorite snack!"
"I was really worried when I ordered this that the phantom power would make it overheat, apparently I was worried for nothing! I use this paired with a Blue Yeti Pro, a seriously beefy microphone, running over shielded cable that is about eighty feet away, It's absolutely great!<br /><br />The one downside that I have seen from this piece of kit: It will occasionally not register as a USB device, Granted I only have seen it happen once, but you will always want to double check your connections!"
"These are no good. I got them thinking they would be a great snack with cheese or meat or jelly...  My kid won't eat them at all and I don't blame him.  They have no flavor, and nothing seems to help. I wouldn't buy them again."
"I really enjoy this green tea, this is my favorite green tea out of dozens that I've tried. No bitterness or grassy aftertaste. I don't have to watch the water temp and babsit how long it steeps. Perfect green tea."
"New puppy loves this, only treat he will pay attention to while walking and training. One note, pieces are quite large so I cut them up into smaller pieces so their recommended daily amount goes further.<br /><br />All the dogs in the dog park can't resist my pocket when I have these treats. Usually surrounded by a crowd of dogs all poking at my pocket."
"Everything AmeriColor that I have purchased works great! I was looking for some lighter tone colors, everything I had was pretty bright. These sheen colors are light with a pretty sheen, it's great! Thank you!"
Me and family love this brand of Peanut Butter. Cant stand the tast of others. And enjoy the free sjhipping from amazon.
"Excellent!!!!!! Grape Laces are what I snack on when I'm watching that special movie or TV program, or when I'm just chillin!!!!"
"can someone please tell me how the ""four net carbs"" on the amazon header page (before you buy it) translates into the 28 carbs on the outside of the box per bar once it arrives?  Are we being lied to?"
"I love these chips.  They are not only diet friendly but they taste really good. I will definetly buy them again, I love that they are a one serving package so I don't have to figure out how many I can eat at a sitting."
Love the product - don't know why it's not on the shelf at Sam's anymore.  Fast shipment.
You can get the 80-count box at Costco for $35 !!!<br /><br />These prices stink.
"Since my family watches both calorie and sugar content, this is an ideal product for us.  Made with fat free milk,<br />it's a perfect treat.  Enough flavoring that a hint  pistachio really comes through.  Looks very pretty served in a glass<br />dessert dish.<br /><br />Our local stores don't always carry this flavor, so we order it in packs of 24, which don't seem to last long."
"I gave each of my two dogs one of these bones after I picked them up grocery shopping on Monday evening. By early tuesday morning one of my dogs was already throwing up (first time on my white bedding, of course) and everything after her first bowel movement of the day was pretty much water. She had diarrhea on the carpet in MULTIPLE areas while I was at work, and then two more times during the night. She was very lethargic and unable to keep any food down at all. Meanwhile, my other dog has now gotten horrible diarrhea as well. Wednesday morning I made them some boiled eggs, but the one dog that was already throwing up ended up losing her breakfast a short while later. I gave her white rice with a little bit of chicken stock for dinner that night and she held that down. But sometime during the night, one of the dogs had diarrhea in the house again! Today is Thursday and both dogs are still loose, but (knock on wood)it seems like the vomiting is under control. I called the vet and she said to split an Immodium AD between the two of them and make sure they are drinking plenty of water, which they have been all through this debacle! I will keep my fingers crossed that my carpert will still be clean when I get home. I will never, ever buy another Hartz product again!"
"nice taste, if not a little strong.  it does it's job well but it is not a detox that replaces fiber.  it is more of a detox for your entire system.  one thing to make note of is that it states not to use for more than one month at a time"
"This is a wonderful product, I was happy to see I could buy it on Amazon because our local stores quit carrying it!  We use it mostly to sprinkle over chicken wings to make a cajun wing..yummy!  It can be used on almost everything. Love It!"
"I make my loose tea in a coffeemaker that has never been used for coffee, and I use unbleached filters to hold the tea.  The tea is fresh and so flavorful you wont believe it.  There is no dust in this tea as in teabags, just real tea.  I dont understand why loose tea isn't available everywhere, but I am glad to have found this source for it.  The price is very reasonable, especially when compared to other loose teas.  Do a Google search for loose tea and you will found out for yourself."
"My dogs love these chews. I have 5 dogs - all various sizes and temperments. I have found they are similar to Greenies but much less expensive. In addition you can often find coupons and sales on these. It is so good for their teeth to let them chew, and even my Yorkie at 11 years old has wonderful teeth because I have been giving her things to chew on since she was a puppy. As always, I do not let my dogs chew on any brand of treats without supervision."
"Huge Chocolate bars would be similar to 5 regular chocolate bars and twice as thick, a bargain at the price really. The best tasting chocolate I have ever had."
"Added 2 T spoons in my smoothie plus a frozen banana, it was great.  You can also add water or oil and make your own peanut butter.  Great on bread or crackers. Love peanut butter and by using this I miss alot of calories.<br />Plus this vendor was fast on delivery."
Green Mountain Coffee Breakfast Blend is good product at a good price!<br />I am very satisfied with the level of service provided.
I don't know what everyone's talking about.  I love this stuff!  Maybe what everyone's missing is the chemicals that are in most commercial condiments.
"This is the second time I have bought this brand. Last time, I bought the 2oz box and it lasted forever and it was also really potent. So when I ran out, I knew I had to buy this brand again. The 4oz jar was the cheapest and the shipping was fast!"
"I'm a self-proclaimed popcorn junkie, so when I saw this ""Real Theater"" popcorn, I knew it would be the perfect compliment to my Whirley-Pop.<br /><br />Not so, unfortunately.  Yes, the product is well packaged and easy to pop.  And yes, almost 100% of the kernels do pop.  Sadly, this ease of use and good popping characteristics don't add up to great tasting popcorn.  It's hard to articulate what is ""bad"" about this popcorn, and perhaps it comes down to personal preference.<br /><br />For one, the aroma of this popcorn is simply not pleasing.  It certainly does smell when it's cooking, but I wouldn't associate the smell with movie theater popcorn.  It's a sort of sickly, sweet smell that sticks to the back of your throat.  It's also a smell that lingers in your house for hours after cooking this popcorn.<br /><br />The finished product isn't much better.  The popped corn is very yellow, I suppose to give the impression of ""real"" butter.  The taste, however, is not what I'd call butter.  The best way I could put it would be ""artificial"" and ""thick"".  ""Thick"", as in, a thick taste that sticks in your mouth and leaves a funky aftertaste.  The end result is a chemically, over-processed taste.  Now, granted, I don't frequent ""real theaters"" but about once every decade, so it's possible this is what passes as popcorn these days.  Personally, I think you can achieve much better results with your Whirley-Pop using one of the many *real* popping corns available on this site, and then adding your own *real* butter, to your taste."
"I originally found these mints at Whole Foods. They taste superb and you get a lot for your money. Plus, it comes in a cute little tin which you can repurpose for other uses! My dog loves them, too. Go organic!"
"Try it, it's great.  It has just a hint on carbonation and not enough to make me hiccup, which is what I do when the carbonation is too strong. The can is a little small for a meal but if you just want a sip or two it's great.  The flavor is the best but don't get the cherry."
"We bought these for our two dogs: a 65 pound, year and a half old lab mix and a six year old, 80 pound shephard/lab mix.  One of the bones splintered and broke in the first hour of them chewing it.  I removed it immediatly and have requested a refund from Amazon for the product.<br />Be careful with these and watch your dogs.  It is a sizable piece that broke and really could have caused some damage if swallowed."
Are they kidding? Who would name a product this? Really!!! Love the part about preventing it from spurting...LOL!
"These chips are delicious, the first time I have have tried Pop Chips brand chips. Different taste then regular chips but there not bad. still working on my first order from a few months ago, there were more in the box then I expected."
"Like the flavor and it's thick, unlike some fat free dressings that are really runny."
I HAD READ ANOTHER REVIEW AND THE REVIEWER WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THIS PRODUCT COMING FROM CHINA.  I CALLED THE MANUFACTURER AND WAS TOLD THIS PRODUCT IS MADE HERE IN THE US.  MY DOG LOVES THEM!!
I really wanted to like these after reading all of the good reviews.  I am not a cheese snob.  I like Baked Lays with cheddar flavor.  But something in the flavor of these cheddar Popchips is not right.  The first bite is OK but then there is a bitter aftertaste.  Too bad.  Back to Lays!
"My dog, Shadow,  loves Greenies more than any treat. He's a Pomeranian and gets the Teenies, and are we in trouble if we run out!  I just bought the tub of 96 on Amazon for less than half the money that the small packages cost at the store. Debbie"
"Switched to these from The Peanut Shop of Williamsburg's tins of salted peanuts (also currently available through Subscribe & Save) and these are MUCH better, plus a better value."
"I've been eating healthy foods almost exclusively for the past 7 years, so I end up eating things like this when I need a snack.  It's whole grain and has the lowest salt content of just about any cracker-type product that I can find, i.e., it's a reasonably healthy food.  Of course, the downside is that it doesn't taste  good.  I couldn't possibly eat it plain.  Instead, I spread on some healthy (i.e., no salt, no sugar, etc.) peanut butter, homemade hummus, or homemade guacamole.  That makes for a decent (but certainly not delicious) snack.  I often wonder if all this healthy eating is worth it."
"This is a great marinade for any kind of meat. I use it also in stir-fry or fried rice receipes.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TGWCBQ"">Garlic Sesame Marinade & Glaze Sauce</a>"
"Plenty of articles have been written about the danger and disease's caused by Chinese made dog treats.  These treats are made in China.  Plenty of healthy USA made treats available.  Avoid these at all costs!!!  After the latest information was released, I tried to return to Amazon, but they said no.  Please do not buy these ""treats""."
"I've had only Zango mangosteen juice and Thai mangosteen juice previously, so I didn't actually know what pure mangosteen juice was like.<br />It is very much like cocoanut milk. Almost the same color and consistency and an even milder flavor. There is no pulp or plant ground up in it so it is very smooth. Sometimes I drink my dose by itself, other times I mix it in any juice because this mangosteen juice doesn't change the flavor.<br /><br />I've heard alot of health claims about mangosteen, pomegranate and acai but I really can't say it's done anything for me, I've only been taking mangosteen for a couple months. I just enjoy knowing I'm putting the good stuff in my system.<br />I like the Amazon automatic delivery system, too, since I can't find this locally, it saves me time and money."
For some reason Merrick thinks this product is worth double now! I bought two 8 lb bags early September and came back to buy the next batch only to notice the price has been hiked a whole 100% from $8.xx to now almost $17! Just gonna transition my dog off this brand and move on to another Company that actually has consistency in pricing!
"I was told about this product and it is wonderful. It is great for diabetics, because of low glycemic index, but great for baking. The sweetness level is around 80% of regular sugar, but so much better for you. Doesn't change the product when baking or cooking with it, like many other sugar substitutes do."
"I ordered an 8 pack of this jerkey to try and stay range grown and healthy in my eating, but when I got it, it was a disaster!<br /><br />First, I only got one of the 8 packs I was paying for.  I can't fault this  jerky, but Amazon's shipping folk for that.  However, the bag had jerky in it that had a strange gray fungus growing on it!<br /><br />I was told this was good jerkey, but I guess I'll never know now.  I may have gotten a very rare moldy pack, but I'll shy away from this stuff."
"I use the Keurig Coffee maker at home.  It's great, I love it.  Read my review on it here within this site.  For those of you who don't know - the Keurig ""K-cup"" coffee maker uses these little cup-packets of coffee grounds to make individual servings of coffee.<br />~<br />I recently bought the part for my coffee maker that allows you to brew your own ground coffee, such as this. I've used it several times, but the coffee always comes out watery or bitter.  I was hesitant to try this brand but let me tell you - it's AWESOME.<br />~<br />This coffee is now my new favorite one to make at home. I've had it several times now and it's always consistently awesome.  A nice bold flavor without being bitter or watery.  It's the ultimate coffee - a nice solid smooth coffee flavor without any harshness or tart aftertaste.  I highly recommend this one for any Keurig Coffee Maker users out there!!!!"
"At first sniff the two girls turned up their noses at the new snack. To be fair, this happens with the introduction of most new snacks to this fussy and suspicious pair. By the third and fourth and subsequent offerings, the hesitation stopped. Though the girls genuinely like these treats now, there isn't the mad excitedness for them like they show for some others or for french fries.<br /><br />I like that the first ingredient of these snacks is  ""real""beef ( not the undesirable artificial beef),and they are made with natural ingredients. The treats are small and chewy and are good for training, rewarding, and bribing. For most dogs the consistency is probably perfect, just enough chew to add interest. For Piper, our shih tzu with a few missing teeth, I break the treats in half so as not to tax the teeth she has left.<br /><br />Science Diet backs these treats with a 100% satisfaction guarantee."
These are amazing. They are so amazing you should buy cases and cases of them and stockpile them in case they are taken off the market.
"When my Yorkie was about 10 1/2 years old, her breath suddenly became extremely nasty!  I thought, perhaps, the malodorous breath was caused by a bad tooth so I took her to the Vet for her annual checkup.  The Vet gave her a clean bill of health and suggested I have her teeth cleaned at the price of over $350!  Well, before forking over the big bucks, I thought I'd try brushing her teeth myself and headed to Petco to buy some doggie toothpaste.  I found the toothpaste and continued to walk around the store because Spunky just LOVES her Petco outings!  I let her sniff her way down the doggie treats aisle when we bumped into the boxes of Greenies.  After checking out a box, I thought it was certinaly worth a shot so I bought a box of 96-count Teenies for $35.<br /><br />As soon as we arrived home, I attempted to brush her teeth the best that I could and then gave her one Greenie.  She seemed to really enjoy it.  I typically buy everything on Amazon so I jumped on here to check the price and was pleasantly surprised to see that the cost was $10 less than Petco's.  I immediately ordered them from Amazon and when that box arrived a day later, I took that unopened box over to Petco and returned it to them to get my $35 back! :)  Very sweet deal.<br /><br />My dog is now a Greenies addict with sweet breath again!  I should create a video review sometime because it's hilarious to see this little Yorkie ""yelling"" for me outside of the pantry door.  She knows exactly where the Greenies are and every morning she runs over to the pantry and just barks for me to get her a Greenie.  I allow her to have two Greenies per day and she seems to know that's her quota.  Both Spunky and I are very happy with Greenies and will continue to buy them!"
"This product was such a disappointment!  As all the other reviewers said, it's a gluey, sticky texture more akin to Elmer's Glue than to an edible food product.  The flavor was sickening sweet.  I actually thought that the frosting had spoiled.  It was that bad!  Save yourself the time and $$ (I paid $4.99) and make your own frosting or go with another brand.  Cherrybrook cake and cookie mixes are so good.  It's hard to believe they even sell this."
"Disclaimer: I'm a coffee addict.  I'm also a Starbucks addict, so I've become a bit snobby about my coffee preferences and can't stand the economy stuff.  I've had regular Melitta coffee before and was favorably impressed by it, so I decided to give the decaf version a try. Especially when the weather gets cold, I like a nice hot cup of coffee in the evenings and don't particular want to be tossing and turning hours later.<br /><br />The Riviera Sunset decaf coffee is an excellent decaf for those times you don't want the real thing. It had a nice, rich flavor with no bitter aftertaste.  While I continue to prefer the real thing on most occasions, I'm glad to know there's a good, flavorful substitute for when I don't want caffeine."
"I love these soy crisps.  They are the perfect salty crunch.  I have a hard time finding snack foods that don't have wheat, corn, or some sort of sugar sweetener in them.  But these fit the bill.  They are *very* salty, tho. I like them that way, but if you're not used to it and can be kindof surprising."
"I want to start by saying I am not a professional, just an average cat owner. I realize this isn't the highest quality cat food out there. However, in my opinion, this is a great middle of the road more natural cat food. Our cats love it and haven't had any problems digesting it.<br /><br />We have 2 cats that are a year old. We adopted them from a shelter 4 months ago. When they were babies they got a virus and as a result have sensitive stomachs. I had to find a food for them with not a lot of fillers and dyes. Particularly the red dye found in most cat foods. The foster home gave them Purina Naturals which was more expensive then Goodlife so I am very happy I found this brand of food. I am a realistic common sense cat owner on a budget so price had to be a factor especially with 2 cats. I admit I didn't know anything about corn and other stuff in cat food. The ingredients in this cat food hasn't had any negative affects on our cats. In fact they have a soft shiny coat, very seldom get hair balls, and are full of energy.<br /><br />I always had cats growing up that ate just regular cat food and they lived to be old. In fact my one cat is 13 years old now. I don't understand why all of a sudden people are so critical of cat food. There are certainly worse cat foods out there with a lot of fillers and dyes that in some cases can be more expensive. I recommend giving this food a try and let your cat decide if he/she likes it."
"I wasn't sure I'd use 6 cans of these but now after a couple of months, I'm already down to 2! I mix these w/my baby's stage 2 baby foods to thicken the texture up. It's worked really great and my baby has taken to these really well."
"some might find it too chewy and nutty.  even fully cooked it tastes healthy, and some might not like that.  the sauce is perfect though, and i like being reminded that its good for me."
"Growing up, Shake'N Bake was a primary staple in our household. I can still remember the anticipation knowing that my mom was using this product to complete our dinner.<br /><br />Fast forward thirty, okay, forty years and when I realized I hadn't used Shake'N Bake in more years than I wanted to admit, I jumped at the chance to try this out.<br /><br />It was exactly as I remembered.  The 2.05 ounce pouch holds just enough seasoning for an entire cut up chicken.  I used five breasts and they were coated perfectly.  It was just that easy.  And just that tasty!<br /><br />I would definitely use this product again.  The spices are just right without being overpowering and the mixture coats the chicken just as intended.<br /><br />Natalie S. for Amazon Vine"
They said the salt and vinegar were horrible! Blecht! Couldn't get the awful taste out of their mouth. Now i'm stuck with this box of popchips! lol.
"I think this is the best one on the Market for at home. If you like Dunkin Donuts at the drive-thru, this is the closest thing you're gonna get at home. I consider myself a Chai Drinker I buy at least 4 at Dunkin Donuts and have at least 4 of these Big Train Chai's at home a day. The only suggestion..... I make is make it with milk, it is awesome that way. I haven't seen this yet at any donut or coffee shops yet. Does anyone know who serves it?"
"Izze sparkling juices are generally pretty good.  This one, unfortunately, is not.  All I can taste in it is apple juice."
"Not a writer but this Reese Cheesy Popcorn is the best in the area Michigan where I use to buy it at Kroger's. We start buying it through amazon because Kroger's stop stocking Reese Cheesy Popcorn, so I hit the net in search of it. It is very tasty on popcorn better than any other power popcorn salt that's been tried by our family. I highly recommend Reese Cheesy Popcorn to all."
"I read several of the reviews before signing up for a subscription for this coffee. Usually Amazon customers are spot on, but in this case the reviews didn't help. This coffee is really weak, watery, and bland. Ever tried running water through a K-cup a second time? It's awful and tastes much like this coffee. AND SINCE IT IS A SUBSCRIPTION, IT'S NON RETURNABLE. That's right, I can't return a $30 order. Be sure you like this stuff before signing up or risk getting stuck with some really bad coffee."
"This itty bitty tree was alive when it arrived, I'll say that for it.  Interesting little pot, but it has no moisture tray, the all important one mentioned as the number one thing you need for the trees health in the accompanying instructions> ?  0.o  (regular wtf moment)  Please Include Tray!!!"
"I can't tell you how <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006VB3TU"">Everlasting Treat Medium Vanilla Mint</a> taste great but my dogs seem to love them and they last a long time.  I got the medium for my 3 pound Chihuahua and 14 pound Chinese Crested Hairless and the size seems to suit them well."
"This product have no flavor at all, I could not taste apple or any other! It was just something sweet. Also it had a bad smell!<br />Am used to the Haribo bears, sold in the US market, they have a noticeable taste, they are made in Turkey. While these bad Frogs are made is Spain....maybe that why they taste and smell funny!!?"
"The freshness is great during the initial crunch but once the chewing and swallowing takes place, these pretzels are very earthy and grainey tasting...I have several bags you can have for free."
"I have a Bigon Fri Maltipoo. He is soooo cute and I give him nothing but the best. He is sweet and friendly.<br /><br /> When he saw this product he first ignored it but I turned my back and then he stuck his little paw in the large shape to get the ball. Such a cute lil guy. Also since he is color blind like all dogs of course, the neon ball was very interesting to him. He rolled it around the house happily. The red part is great too because I can actually clean it unlike his other furry toys. I'm so happy a company actually took the time and effort to create such a great product with your dog in mind.<br /><br />Thanks CAGEY :)"
"I am a Saba fan.  It is expensive for this but the intensive flavor given to salad dressings, dips, etc is without equal.  Use your imagination for this fruity/astringent addition.  The only responsibily bad results is yours for poor execution."
This is delicious coffee which compares favorably with much higher priced coffee.  It's a well-kept secret!  Low acidity and smooth taste are hallmarks of this brew.<br /><br />I especially liked the fact that each bag is resealable to keep the coffee at maximum freshness.  I will definitely buy again and again.
well u get the energy u really want for the 5 hours and it really boast u a bit but that u will be calm again and need to rest.. not bad great product
I add a teaspoon to my protein powder for additional nutrition and because they have no flavor the chocolate taste is not affected plus Chia seeds thicken my concoction.
Great price for an excellent chip. At about 80 cents for a 2 ounce bag these are a bargain as well as a very tasty chip. Everyone I've let try these has been impressed and commented on how good they taste. I've yet to find a Kettle chip that disappointed!
"I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me."
"I have been working through all of the SodaStream flavor offerings. This is the first I have truly not cared for. It has a chemical taste to it that really put me off of it. I tried the regular and it was just fair, but the diet-which I have loved all their other offering so far--just did not work in my opinion."
"I feel like I've tried every hot cocoa there is in the k-cups.  While I do think this is the best hot cocoa so far, it still isn't great.  I'm not sure what it is, but all of the cocoa k-cups seem to have a weird taste to them.  It's almost like there is artificial sweetener in them,, but I know there is not.<br />I set it on the smallest cup setting for cocoa.  This has more body to it than others.<br />I'm still waiting and hoping that Dunkin' Donuts will put out their hot cocoa in a k-cup.  There really is nothing better than that.<br />If you want a k-cup hot cocoa, I would def. recommend this over all the others."
"I was first introduced to astronaut ice cream about 2-3 years ago and it is amazing and really fun to eat. I have a 4 & 8 year old boys and a 15 year old nephew that love these. They definitely are quite different from a real scoop of ice cream out of the freezer, but it is only in texture and the experience. I have since ordered these to give out at Christmas time for my son's classmates. I thought this would be a totally unique, great, and affordable gift for all of them and am sure most of them have not had this before. I definitely think everyone should try this at least once and if you don't want to buy the 15 packages you can order them individually and there's different flavors too. (There are 25 kids in the class so I ordered 2 of the bulk and then I'll have some left over for my nephew, boys, myself & husband)."
"If your newborn cries inconsolably, you should try a lactose-free formula right away even though they're so expensive. However, the ingredients may not look so good.  It's important to shop around if you're going to use a lactose-free formula. Lactose-free formulas always are the most expensive and this one is loaded with processed corn syrup solids.<br /><br />From Wikipedia: ""Baby colic (also known as infant colic, three-month colic, infantile colic and colic) is a condition in which an otherwise healthy baby cries or screams frequently and for extended periods without any discernible reason."" You'll know it if it happens to your baby, and it's awful to not be able to do anything to immediately relieve your baby.  It contains DHA, ARA and iron, but all baby formulas do because it is required by law.<br /><br />Lactose-free formula is expensive is because it goes through a very specialized and difficult manufacturing process, I'm told by the company's public relations representative.  So much food in the U.S. is prepared with corn syrup solids, so that shouldn't be a worry, I'm told.  Ok, but I notice the obesity rate is high."
"And that's part of the problem. No, really, I can eat just a few, maybe more later.<br />These thins are not quite as thin as I'd prefer (nor am I), but make a good snack. For hors d'oeuvres, if you top them with anything moist, do a few at a time; they get soggy pretty fast."
I used these lollipops for a candy princess costume for my daughter. They came in perfect condition and exactly like the picture shows. They do come in a group of 16...such a great value! I was extremely satisfied!
"Our Minneapolis Indian shops stopped selling Darjeeling tea over a year ago. I love this tea as it tastes like the stuff I grew up drinking in England, altho I drink this black, no sugar.<br /><br />A year ago, I bought a couple of pounds online for $15/pound including shipping. I have done a lot of searching to find out why Darjeeling has seemingly disappeared. The Indian grocers are mystified, and online there is no clue. Apparently, green label Darjeeling is Lipton's most popular tea. Hard to believe if people can't actually purchase it. The name changed from Lipton Green Label to Lipton Finest Darjeeling.<br /><br />iShopIndian has 250g for $6.99 but have a flat shipping fee of $10, so one would want to buy several boxes. I have not bought through this vendor, but I plan to.<br /><br />I have a friend visiting India and hope she will find room in her suitcase to bring me back a pound (or 3). I plan to ask if there is a shortage in India.<br />Good luck finding this tea at an affordable price!"
"I've never had an allergic reaction to any food, or anything else, in my life.  But within 20 seconds of starting to chew a piece of this gum, my throat began to burn and my airway became constricted.  That's strange, because I've been chewing spearmint and peppermint ice cubes for a while now with no reaction.  I ""tasted"" another piece from another pack (we get this stuff free at the dining facility here in Iraq), and again, my throat started burning.  So, if you have a history of food allergies, you might not want to try this flavor."
"Purchased two liters... looking for an oil to put in salads, on bread, etc... something with a strong flavor of olive oil... this is NOT it.  This is good for cooking... has little flavor."
"I bought these chips, and wanted to try if they were tasty. It sure is!  Unique and different flavor and the right thickness.<br /><br />It remains crunchy, spicy and flavorful with a hint of tabasco and paprika sauce for heat. There are some rice granules embedded with the tortilla chips. However, some of the spices are lacking from this chip. But I liked this very much.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who wants to try a red beans and rice tortilla chips. Go ahead-- you can put other ingredients as nachos except the cheese.  Maybe some el pastor, shredded meat, tomatoes, etcetera."
"This is my favorite coffee flavor and I have not had it in a long time.  Forgot how delicious it was until we ordered the k-cups.  Love them, already ordered more."
I tried this flavor within a variety pack and LOVED IT!  I usually add cream and sugar to my coffee.  With this k cup I added coconut creamer and found that I did not have to add any sugar!  It was so sweet and light and tasted just like a pina colada.  I absolutley love this k cup and am planning to sign up for subscribe and save on this one!
"Horrible ""hemical"" taste.Extremely salty !!!!!!<br /><br />This was a complete waste of money,after the first bag I will have to throw the whole box away !!!!!!!!"
"I love real Dr. Pepper and I enjoy Diet Dr. Pepper.  On a Friday night some people will relax with a glass of wine or beer, I drink a Dr. Pepper.  I was really excited to try the Soda Stream versions but I was so disappointed.  I tried them in the sample pack and wasn't impressed but thought I might be able to acquire a taste for them.  I really like the ingredients in the SodaStream syrups so I wanted to give it a try.  We actually ended up pouring out  most of the Diet Dr. Pete because no one liked it.  Maybe it's just my taste buds because the only SodaStream flavor I really like is the diet cranberry raspberry.  My husband enjoys several flavors but I mostly drink seltzer.<br /><br />If you are looking for a Dr. Pepper double you'll be disappointed."
"Been buying and enjoying Romanoff fish egg products for years and thought that I received spoiled product. The new sweet caviar is one of the worst things I have ever tasted. Do not buy it, unless you want a fishy dessert."
"This was the worst tasting tea, actually the worst tasting anything, that I have ever consumed. I took one sip and could not bring myself to finish the cup. It tasted like dirt, which makes sense since it is a root. The rest of the tea bags are going in the trash."
"My dog figured this out in 20 secs and quickly lost interest right after. Just spinnning a little opens up ALL the food compartments. Also, its hard to get at some of the food given how narrow the opening is. Would not recommend."
I order these peas and they came fast. the product<br />has a good flavor and I am very happy with the peas.<br />I will order with them again
"Oh man, I, like many of us have tried so many Cajun Seasoning, but this company does it Right!!<br /><br />Thank you Folks at the Heart-Heat of Southern Seasoning!!<br /><br />All my love,<br />Roy Watson,<br />408-464-0100"
"My son, who is in the first grade, is having a block party at school. We were asked to buy ""Giant"" Pixy Stix as prizes for the game his class is sponsoring. We were quite pleased with these initially, until we saw what the other children brought.  ""Giant Pixy Stix"" same brand, same label, same name, TWICE THE SIZE. These weigh 15 grams (1/2 an ounce) and are about 12 inches long. In comparison, the other, larger stix, were 30 grams (an ounce) and 24 inches long. Seems like they should have a different name. The only thing GIANT about these, was the disappointment on my son's face :("
I have purchased these in the past and enjoyed them. This whole box is old. the flavor is off badly.
"Let me start off with some info about myself.<br />A few weeks ago after my son's birthday I looked at myself and decided I needed to lose weight. Since then Ive lost 14 lbs so far.<br />In addition to my work-outs and my protein shakes I love this meal.<br />I have the Tasty Bit Jodhpur Lentils for dinner when im at work.<br />I unlike alot of reviewers enjoy the soupy texture. I add my homemade dried habenero powder to it, because I love spicy foods. I also love the flavor of cumin, I dont find it overpowering or over salty like some think.<br />I usually eat the whole packet as a dinner option and I get full off of it, I dont need anything with it and it satisfies my appetite.<br />For the price with the discount and the subscribe and save combined it cant be beat."
"I am a ""breakfast blend"" coffee drinker, so maybe this was just too strong for me, but I tried a cup black & another cup with cream and sugar, and this coffee tasted terrible both times.<br /><br />I did like the low acid aspect, but I think they should try flavored versions."
Glutino crackers taste better than any of the other gluten free crackers that I have tried. It is nice that there are so many choices available for those that need alternatives.
"Instead of just being pork rinds, oil, salt and vinegar, they have lactose and maltodextrin on them, contributing to 2g of sugar per serving.  Many people (myself included) who buy this kind of snack who are on low carbohydrate diets; they will not be happy about the sugar.<br /><br />The labeling on the package is very strange, and I am surprised it gets by the nice government men who worry about this sort of thing.  It says Total Carbohydrates are less then 1g, so they get to put zero grams.  Ok, fair enough, I have seen that before.  But then the label admits to 2 grams of sugar, which is a carbohydrate.  How they can get away with saying they have zero grams of carbs when there are 2 grams of sugar is beyond me.  I assume it is just that nobody has caught them yet.<br /><br />Then there is protein.  The nutritional analysis says 8g of protein per serving.  Not bad for a snack food.  Right next to the 8g is says ""Not a significant source of protein.""  Huh...A slice of cheese is about 8 grams of protein, as is an ounce of meet.  I believe those are significant sources of protein.<br /><br />I went to their website, to check out the nutritional facts.  I did notice they were high in sodium.  What I missed was that they claim the number of servings in a 1.75 oz package was three (3), so the sodium in a package is actually three times higher.  I doubt many people expect a 1.75 oz package to be three servings.  I just looked up Fritos Corn chips.  A 2 oz package is considered a single serving package, and the analysis on the back shows one serving.  So when Fritos tells you the sodium level, it is only 320 mg for the entire package.  For these pork rinds, the 1.75 oz package is 900 mg of sodium, about half of your daily requirement.  A little steep for a snack.<br /><br />Although I went to their site to look at some nutritional info, they don't shows the label or the actual ingredients on their site or at Amazon.  If they had, I would not have purchased it.  They use partially hydrogenated oil, a kind of fat may be destructive to your health long term.  Since the government broke down and required that partially hydrogenated oil be listed on the label, a lot of the food industry has switched away from it, as people are correctly suspicious of it.<br /><br />To add insult to injury, I was unhappy with the taste.  They have a chemical, nasty taste.  I suppose that is subjective, but a few bites left me a little queasy.<br /><br />I feel bad having bought this, but perhaps my error will be of some use to others looking for a low carb snack.  Please pass this company's products by, and let's find someone else who can actually provide us the food we want and the information we need in a rational, ethical and legal way."
"I bought these jimmies because I couldn't find the needed orange color in any of my local stores.  A pound of jimmies is a lot, but I went through more than I expected, probably half the bag to thoroughly coat a recipe of chocolate truffles.  The taste is, well, jimmy-taste.  My only disappointment/surprise was how short these jimmies are -- about two-thirds of the length of Wilton and CakeMate brands I have in the cupboard.<br /><br />If you need a special color that only CK makes, don't hesitate to get them.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee  Wesselmann"
"This tea has a completely different taste than ALL the other black teas out there....  It is reddish/orange in color, which is odd too....as most black teas are uniformly ""dark"".  It has, what I characterize, as a ""burnt tea"" flavor, even though I only steep it for 5 minutes max.<br /><br />I once bought an off brand Chinese tea and it too was ""red"" in color and had the same ""burnt"" taste.<br /><br />I think everyone here is confused.  Black tea should be black, not red.  This tea was also quite cheap at Whole Foods, only $3.99 for organic tea.  I have paid twice that for better tasting, BLACK, organic black tea.<br /><br />I'm pissed at the burnt flavor and red color.  I can barely stand it iced.  Will likely have to buy something else."
Two stars is kind. I am not sure what is going on here as I have been using this dog food for some time now.... but the bag I just opened (from Amazon) is not the same as the last ten bag of this stuff. First off it is a different color??? and second the soft bits are hardly in this bag. The soft bits that are in the bag are hard and crumble in my hand. Now this may not be Amazon fault.... it could have been store wrong... or Purina has change the blend. Either way I am not happy nor is my dog. I will be calling Purina first thing tomorrow morning and ask for my money back and then buy a local bag and see what is what. So right now buyer beware.<br /><br />10/04/2012 Just an update .... called Purina and the are sending me a coupon for a free bag and an additional discount coupon for my trouble .... but it will take 7 to ten days. My wife went to walmart today to get a new bag so my dog will eat again ;-)
Arrived well packaged and just as described.  Also expiration date was not for another 6 months.  Can't beat the price either a lot cheaper than the grocery store.
"Jablum Jamaican coffee is Jamaica itself, especially the Sandals Resort at Ocho Rios. If you ever make it to Jamaica, be sure to buy plenty of Jablum in the airport's Duty Free stores . . . it is far less expensive, but not necessarily fresher. Also, make sure that the bean quality is #1 (not a problem with Jarblum products, but a concern with other Jamaican ""blends"" offered in stores and on the Internet). Thank heaven for the Blue Mountains (the ""blum"" in Jablum)!"
This was the only treat my dog liked during obedience training and it has remained her favorite ever since.  I haven't met a dog that didn't like this treat!
"I went for these, when I got a free 30 bucks to spend with a new Amazon Credit Card, and Im glad I didn't pay full price.<br /><br />I was in the process of creating an authentic Bolognese Meat Sauce, and I wanted some very hearty mushrooms to add a bit of OOMPH to the sauce, which is meat and onion heavy, and I figured from the reviews that these are a meaty tasting mushroom.  I also see the price asked for these at our local Giant Eagle grocery stores, so, yeah, I did get a bargain from their rip off pricing, but, these are basically taking up freezer space.<br /><br />I ordered two grades, a higher grade with bigger shroom pieces, less stems, etc, and in retrospect, should have just ordered the scraps, or even the dust, as I found the big pieces stayed a nasty tough chewy texture, even after hours of cooking, I also extracted just juice from the mushrooms, but the broth wasn't strong enough to bother, I basically just chop these in the food processor, and add a LOT of them to get a change in flavor in recipes, the one ounce bags, don't even bother with, because it takes a lot to get some flavor from them.<br /><br />In all honesty, I have not used another Poricini product, so I can't compare, but, I am disappointed with the results I got from these, it may be they do exactly what they are supposed to, for some one with a very tender palate, but, not for me, and in no case, are these ever going to be rehydrated and served on steak, they just stay too nasty of a product to serve by themselves, strictly good for grinding and using in a recipe."
"This is not regular coffee as the description would lead you to believe... it's artificially flavored, and it appears from the other ratings that you either love the flavor or hate it. My household hated it. Of course, that would be my problem if the description was accurate, but it's not. Amazon refunded my money and said someone would check the information on the product page."
"i got this in the mail nice packaging and all opened it up to see its single serving bags 3oz of hot water to a bag ...not gallon size =( so i decided to make some and it tasted like the little pink bubble gum ""double bubble"" i used to get as a kid yuck so not what i was expecting..."
I've tried and tried to convince myself that these crackers are acceptable but they just aren't. If you are desperate for a cracker find another. I rarely throw any food out but I made an exception in this case. It is terrible.
"These smell so good and are cute and a great size, with a bend in the middle to help roll, and holds together really well with tasty glue. Definitely recommend. Smell like strawberry bubble gum, doesn't really affect flavor too much, but better than plain ones and very sweet. Box says ""printed with soy ink"" so it's clean and I don't have to worry about ridiculous chemicals for the graphics."
"This is for the Health Valley Tomato Soup No Salt Added, 15 Ounce Cans (Pack of 12).  I purchased this specifically for a person with heart problems.  One of the problems with canned foods is too much sodium, so the No Salt Added is a good feature.  Another problem is cholesterol content.  The ad for this product states 0 mg cholesterol, which is a false statement.  Apparently the supplier did not update the ad when Health Valley changed their recipe for their No Salt Tomato soup and is now adding cholesterol.  The cans I received have a ""NEW"" on the label, which the can shown in the ad does not.  This is an honest mistake on the seller's part, but he should correct it, and he should list the true contents."
I ordered this as a gift for a friend and he loved it!  The designs were well done and the chocolate taste was great.
"I've just prepared my first can of this soup.  It tasted incredibly bland, and didn't have much clam flavor.  So then I added more milk, butter, onions, salt and fresh ground pepper, plus white wine.  For 2.92 per 15 oz. can, all of those ingredients should have been adequately added in there already, except for the pepper. Bar Harbor brand certainly didn't stint on the other ingredients in order to increase the amount of clams, that's for sure.  There were larger pieces of clams than in Progresso's - but that's damning with faint praise.  Next time I'll buy the clams and make my own, for less, probably.  I'm just perplexed by these reviews;  I think I can safely say Progresso's tastes better.  And, of course, it's much less expensive."
"Whole-wheat pasta is better for you.  However, this brand, Davinci is an absolute ripoff.  It is about $3 per box for only 12 oz.  To give a perspective, one could buy 16oz boxes of whole-wheat spaghetti for $1 per box and it will taste just as good.<br /><br />One would think that the pasta is organic at this staggering price, but no it is just regular whole-wheat pasta in a small 12oz. box.  This is definitely a case of not getting what you pay for!"
"My reason for the low rating is that there was no ""use by"" date on the bag, making it difficult to know if the beans were old and not well cared for or if that's just the way Tanzanian peaberry beans roast up.  Not sure how a manufacturer gets away without putting a date on their products, but this supplier has found some way to get around it.  The coffee does taste good, although a hint of staleness exists, but the beans are totally dry: no oil, no moisture is present when they are ground.  I've enjoyed peaberry coffees from Hawaii for years, peaberries are the best of the best beans.  I've also come to enjoy African coffees for their full yet mild taste. So, to find peaberry coffee from Tanzania at such a great price was too much to pass up.  I expect to finish up the coffee I've purchased, but probably wouldn't buy it again or buy any coffee from this supplier since I have no assurance of its freshness."
"Quite an unusual taste but one that I found fantastic. This coffee is made with rum and tastes great and there aren't any hangovers from too much alcohol.<br /><br /> <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I6PYAC"">Coffee Masters Flavored Coffee, Jamaican Me Crazy, Whole Bean, 12-Ounce Bags (Pack of 4)</a>"
"This  coffee is the smoothest dark roast coffee I have ever tasted,and it was a pleasure to sip this full bodied coffee before breakfast and after dinner."
My 2 year old recently was diagnosed allergic to Gluten. These Pb & J bars have saved us. He loves them and these are his favorite flavor.
"My family prefers food made from scratch-breads, soups, jams, pickles, etc. The taste has more depth, better spices, texture & freshness. So, I thought I'd give making my own yogurt a try. I have used the Yogourmet  Starter with excellent results in a EuroCuisine maker. I use a combination of skim, 2% & powdered milks & a long overnight processing time  for a thicker, Greek style product.  All of us love the ""tang""  & texture of the fresh yogurt. Since we started eating the homemade yogurt, we have noticed better digestion & less between meal hunger,too."
"I am a college student who loves to cook and this was given to me about 4 months ago. I am so impressed with its ability to keep my herbs fresh for such a long period of time. It not only gives more options when I am cooking by having fresh herbs available, but also, its easy to clean, and stores easily in my small fridge. I really think this is a must have product for EVERYONE!<br /><br />And if interested in a larger one, I attached a link to the company site (Prepara), where you can see all their cool and innovative products.<br /><br />[...]"
"This is great coffee.  I am a coffee purist.  I don't add cream or sugar (unless it is weak or bitter). I truly enjoy coffee.  I have tried many different types of coffee for K-cups.  This is my new favorite. The price was amazing too.  Very smooth and subtle hazelnut flavor, not overpowering."
We have been using Meyenberg's powdered goat milk for several years.  We used to buy their milk in cartons at Walmart and it was good.  The only problem was that we live so far from a Walmart store that we would run out of goat's milk between trips.  We decided to try the powdered and found that it mixes and stays mixed very well and tastes exactly like the liquid milk in the cartons.  Of course it stores easily and indefinitely and we highly recommend it to anyone who wants or has to drink goats milk.
"Seriously, this is one of the best bar gadgets one could ever find! It just arrived today and I've already put it to the test. It's so easy to use and makes stuffing blue cheese olives quick and easy! It's also extremely well made with a great design. Only thing that could make it better would be a button/feature that dispersed pre-made belvedere martinis :D Definitely no complaints."
"This is an excellent training treat for every day.  It's not a ""high value"" treat (used for more challenging training situations) nor is it so bland that it does not serve as an incentive.  It's a good size, though it does make some crumbs.  Plus, ""liver biscotti"" is fun to say!"
"Not the healthiest thing on the menu but when you want the taste of Movie Theater popcorn there is really no other substitute.  The portion, flavor and salt are all perfectly measured so we have never needed to add anything else (except maybe a dash of tobasco or some cayenne pepper to spice it up a bit.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this product but wished it was a little cheaper (hence 4 instead of 5 stars).  I guess you can't have everything."
It is cubes for our horses. They came in on time and the horses like them. There is not much more to say about sugar cubes.
This paste gave BOTH my dogs diarrhea each time I used it. It's also got disgusting fillers. The price is WAY too high for how little use you get out of each can. Just buy a large peanut butter or cream cheese or throw left over chicken in the Kong and freeze it. Why pay this if you can get 20x the use out of a jar of peanut butter? I only caved because I had been curious for months AND it went on sale.
My Grandkids love it and so do we! Pops easy and tastests great. A bag of it came when I had to replace my old popcorn popper and we've been using it ever sense. My grandkids and their friends think I make the best popcorn ever!
"I like it better letting this power powder tingle directly on my tongue.<br />Only take in small doses though. Pleasantly sour, but too much of it unmixed at once will cause coughing and choking.<br />Excellent source of C & B12 vitamins."
Excellent service!  Excellent Price!  Excellent Product!  I can't keep the dog off the phone telling her friends how much she is enjoying her Best Buddy Treats!  I have a very happy dog!
"My dog absolutely loves these treats. We have tried many treats since we have had her, and she has never loved any of them as much as she loves these. When she is done eating one, she will stalk the bag and try to manipulate us into giving her another one. She literally goes crazy for them. I like the fact there are so few ingredients and that they do not have any grains in them. Our dog is getting older, so I feel good about the ingredients for her joints. The only reason that I gave them four stars instead of five is that they are made in China; I really wish they were made in the United States. I must warn you though; your dog may become addicted--just like mine :)"
This is good smooth harissa.<br />This brand is the most commonly found in France and my Moroccan Grandma was swearing by it.<br />I would get a lot more if the shipping charge were not so ridiculous!
"When you first give them out, be careful, you might just draw back a nub! Our oldest dog was very nonchalant about her treats. We just about had to beg her to eat them. NOT THESE. She went nuts over these and looked forward to them every night. The vet said I should give her liver to build her red blood cells up. It helped buy us a little longer with her I think. Now the other 2 dogs are addicted to them also! It is a HEALTHY treat that they love. They would eat the whole tub in one sitting if I would let them! It has no awful liver smell either!"
"This cherry juice concentrate taste very cherry :-)  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0032JKWGI"">Country Spoon Montmorency Red Tart Cherry Juice Concentrate 34 oz.</a> I like this product, and, perhaps, I will order this cherry juice concentrate again."
"Might look tasty but lacks even a touch of white chocolate flavor. Maybe the other flavors are better, but definitely steer clear of this - not worth anything near $1+ a bar."
"I bought both the Creme Caramel and this Hazelnut kcup and I couldn't tell them apart even if my life depended on it... The flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too and unlike the Caramel one, this one has a nasty bitter aftertaste like the flavor is artificial.  Yeah, I know it's artificial but I hate that it actually tastes like a chemical!  Yuk...<br /><br />This is one of those coffees you can serve to company who doesn't know good coffee or people you don't want to have come to your house any more as one cup of this and they won't be your friends after it!  It really is quite bad."
My daughter that is 16 and allergic to Wheat refuses to follow the diet. Until I bought this. Now I make her Waffles and freeze them every few days. I usually get 7-8 waffles out of a box. They are excellent.
"For any of you tea lovers out there, this brand of Chai has got to be the best.  FORGET Starbucks!  There is so much flavor bursting out of that tiny little bag, you wonder how they packed it all in.  I've even attempted to make my own chai, figuring hey, if it's fresh, it's better.  Not so here.  The only thing that compares is German Fruchte-tee (which is so much better than American herbal teas) that engulfs the water with red juice the moment you touch hot water to the tea bag.  Definately worth buying in bulk."
"Ok, so I'm sure this isn't authentic Chai to everyone. But for a person, like myself, that lives in a rural area with very few coffee shops this is perfect. I can't afford to buy a single latte for the same price I could pay for a box of 8 packets. And why should I? This mix is wonderful and I don't even have to add milk! Just heat some water or pour in the packet. Instant goodness."
With a variety pack I received about 7 of these k-cups. I tried the first one and it was very bitter. I let my mother in-law to try it separately without knowing my feelings about it and she said to me the same think.<br /><br />I tried over 50 different varieties of k-cups but this one definitely take the 1st place of the worst taste and the most bitter flavor.<br /><br />This is the first time I write a negative review and it is disappointing but my hope is that maybe they can do something to fix that problem with their coffee.
I love Italian roast  realized - and French roast- This is very expensive.  I ju purchasest that I'm on Amazon - and I don't purchaise things from Amazon.
"After a lifetime of tea drinking, I can honestly say that this is the best Earl Grey I have ever tasted.  I have ordered it a number of times, and each batch is consistently excellent. I have even given it as a gift, as its container is superb for keeping loose tea fresh.  The metal canister has an inner lid that is lifted with its own attached knob, so the tea stays dry and fresh for the length of time it takes to use it up.  Do yourself a favor, if you like Earl Grey, and treat yourself to this tea."
"Be warned, the BBQ flavor is terribly addicting. In fact, I'm eating some right now. Local prices hovered around $4.50 a bag (!!!!!) so I ordered them off Amazon for a great price. If only Amazon would ship them one by one a few days apart so I won't eat 4 bags in one sitting.... ;] Go ahead and try them, you won't regret it."
I think this is a great product but my picky dog gets tired of it after a week.
"I love the sugar free, calorie/fat free syrups for my coffee.  I even put the Raspberry and Vanilla flavors in my diet soda.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it's still a bit on the expensive side and I would really like to create my own variety pack and select the flavors I love most!  The variety pack is cheaper than buying the bottles individually, so I will just take what I get!"
"I know some have given these a bad review for their taste.  I really like the taste - and most would consider me a picky eater.  I think they taste similar to muncho's without as much salt.  When you need a salty snack, this is a great one to try."
Pop Chips are the best chips I've had in a long time.  I'm a Weight Watcher and to satisfy that salty craving I get now and then these chips are the ticket and they are only 2 points.  And when I buy a case of them they average I think about .94.  Not bad.
"We bought a small bag of Canidae to give it a try, as we are always trying new foods for our 3 dogs.  I normally serve 2 kinds of food for dinner and whenever we put Canidae in the dish, the dogs would always eat the other food first.  I'm glad I only bought a small bag.  For the price, the food should be more appealing.  But our dogs just didn't like it and we were glad when it was all gone.  I will never buy again!"
"Our 2 year old son is affected by Celiac disease and since his diagnosis we have had a difficult time finding snacks that are easy to take out on a play date or to a park.  The ""Glutino Apple Cinnamon Rings"" serve that purpose very well for us and he LOVES them.  They don't taste like your typical cereal that contains flour - of course they don't.  But for someone who is on a gluten free diet and is accustomed to way the way that processed gluten free food tastes, these are a great, quick snack."
these are the same spices thare used on the food network always fresh and great to use
Fast shipping. Smells good when you open the tea bag - tastes like watered down coffee with a faint mint aftertaste. Not recommended.
"Besides the fact that these sardines are an excellent source of omega-3 fat (at 1.6g per can), these sardines are just plain yummy. I think of them as ""raw material:"" Crushed in a bowl and mixed with ranch dressing, they make 1 1/2 excellent sandwiches. Eaten from the can with beet greens, fresh oregano and a bit of Himalayan sea salt, they make an entree that dirties exactly one fork!<br /><br />Besides being delicious, these sardines were a bargain at $1.37 per can. With a Prime subscription like I have (in order to stream Prime TV and video to my TV via my Roku) the $1.37 per can includes shipping. Speaking of shipping, the box that held my dozen tins of sardines was too nice to throw away..."

"Sending it back to Amazon.  Most of the cans have large dents in them. The bubble wrap around the cans is fine, the box is fine, so I assume the cans were shipped with the dents."
I gave my 11 old Rott X this product when he was very ill and could not keep anything down on this stomach.  He loved the taste and didn't have a problem keeping it down.  It also kept him hydrated while building his strength back.  It's a little expensive but well worth it in the long run.
"My westie has food allergies and has had tummy problems since a puppy. He had soft stools and was gassy. I fed him really good food. He started scratching, licking paws, and getting waxy yeasty ears. He would vomit first thing in the morning. These are all signs of food allergies. I tried the grain free foods. They seemed to help but he still had problems. I changed his food to one brand and he got very sick to the point he had to spend a couple days at the vets. My vet recomended the California Natural no Grain. My dog is doing so much better. His stools are normal, almost no gas, and his itching is almost gone. If he does get grain like a stray cracker or cheerio he is a sorry puppy (he just turned one) for a couple of days. I'm so happy my vet recommended it and it is available at other places too."
"We love pop chips at our house, they are a great addition to a Weight Watchers diet. They are kind of pricey when they are regular priced at the store, So we buy them in bulk either on Amazon, or when they go on sale at CVS pharmacy. Our favorite flavor is the BBQ. Great snack, no guilt!"
"Less expensive than the grocery store, and great quality.  Don't need to boil fresh potatoes, can use these right out of the can.  Very satisfied."
I heard about this from a friend to help save points on Weight Watchers...I bought it and LOVE it. Really great taste and easy to make and take with you anywhere.
I am so addicted to peanut butter. I eat it every day as my breakfast with an apple to dip into it. This peanut butter is so good and easy to make. All you do is add some water into it and basically you choose the consistency. It tastes amazing and I couldn't be happier with it. I'm so glad i ran across this product!
"I am happy to find that Amazon carries the Van Houtte k-cups, as the pricing is far better than other resources for k-cups.  This k-cup flavor strikes a nice balance between coffee and the chocolate and raspberry flavors, and you can feel like you're enjoying a nice truffle candy without the calories or guilt.<br /><br />The two box packaging is a plus if you're like me and have a Keurig at home and another at work.  This way, a box can go to work and the other stay home.  NOTE: these are the 24 count boxes, too, not the 12 or 14 that seem to fill the shelves of the local supermarkets, WalMart and department stores!<br /><br />If you're new to the K-cups and want a flavored coffee that delivers the flavor in the title, you can't go wrong with any of the Van Houtte varieties.  The Raspberry Chocolate Truffle and French Vanilla are my favorites, followed by Gloria Jean's Butter Toffee and Mudslide."
"It is always a challenge to find healthy, delicious food.  While Popchips is a snack food, most all of us still enjoy chips.  That being the case, I have not found any better chip in my years of search that has such good taste and health considerations.  I offer them to people who eat the heavy saturated chips, and they love the Popchips."
These rice crackers are the most delicious pick me up with actual crunch and flavor.  The plain rice crackers are excellent with cheese and whatever dip but these are great plain with lots of taste. (Less calories) TRY THEM!  They will get soft if you don't seal them.
"Title says it all. I took a dollop of this on a cracker. There is an odd mild and nondescript flavor that I doubt would taint anything. Then the burn begins to build. It just continues to build up until ridiculous levels. The mouth is the easy part, anyone can conquer that and sit mildly while waiting for the 30 minutes to go by. Its the other 3 hours of intense gut pain that makes a man out of you (you don't see that in the videos). Its worse if you eat it later after a previously eaten meal because it just sits in your stomach burning the hell out of you until all that food goes down the tubes. Sucked both times I did it. Used properly, it puts a mean heat in anything you eat.<br /><br />Don't bother trying to be an hero and eating a spoonful, you can't handle it."
"First you must know I am one who roasts my own green beans at home, including Sumatran, but also many African varieties. I like a STRONG cup of coffee. I use K-cups at work because we have no facility for rinsing/cleaning/getting water for a regular machine.<br /><br />Sumatran coffees generally have a very rich, earthy taste; some would describe it as being ""tangy"" almost. Having tried the two other main brands of Sumatran for K-cups, the Puck is by far the best. It is not as bold as something you would get from Starbucks or from roasting yourself, but it has all the flavor elements of a good Sumatran cup. It especially has that nice earthy taste. Even the aftertaste is rich.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: If you are looking for a k-cup that you will use on any other than the smallest cup setting, this coffee is not for you. In my opinion you get a Sumatran because you love strong coffee. Watered down it loses its distinctiveness. Get a generic french roast if you want weaker coffee with some flavor. I make mine with 2 k-cups, at the smallest setting. By camparison, I would give a Starbucks Sumatra mandheling a 10/10 rating for boldness. The Puck is about an 8, the Diedrich is a 4.<br />I highly recommend this coffee for bold coffee lovers, provided you use the smallest cup setting. You will not be disappointed. Best K-cup I have had yet, and I have tried many- Newman, Timothy's, Donut Shop, Diedrich, etc.<br /><br />Addendum: I have since tried th Green Mountain Sumatran, and gave that a one -star. Stale and bitter. I will definitely stay with Puck's."
"My dogs have been enjoying these treats for years and we've ordered this many times from Amazon in the past.  However, our last order was a big disappointment.  The description of exactly how much of this product you will receive is very unclear, so when I saw that the product weight is 4.2 lbs and the shipping weight is 4.6 lbs., naturally I expected to receive a minimum of three one pound bags (as we have in the past).  Not so.  Amazon outrageously charged us $41.00 for a single one pound bag of dried lamb lungs.  You'd think I was buying caviar!  The treats were promptly packed back up and returned.  Tsk, tsk, tsk, Amazon :(<br /><br />So, 5 stars for the product itself.  0 stars for Amazon this time."
"Both of my cats (age 11) threw up for an extended period after eating just 3 of these. Into the trash they go (not the cats, the treats). Not sure what they were reacting to but thought it would be good to let other cat parents know the risk."
"This is by far my favorite Chai.  I went through 2 cans all by myself last Spring, so ordered more!  Yum!"
Excellent product. Haven't seen it on store shelves for a long time.  I wish we could get it here locally.
My Rottie puppy expects one of these each night when I turn off the lights for her to go to sleep.  I sure hope they're good for her 'cuz she loves them.
"We are very pleased with this pumpkin. We purchase it in quantity because we use it daily for our three cats. And we were surprised how with this brand, they do not turn their nose up at the food with it mixed in. We like it too!"
"This is a smooth not bitter coffee. It's a little more pricey than some which are just as good, but it has a good sweet flavor, and I can recommend it."
"The product itself was delicious, I could have done a little better by shopping around prices but overall happy w purchase."
"These chips are good. Knowing that they're not as bad for you will make you eat more of them - very dangerous. Most of the time, the chips tasted quite good, but every now and then I'd get one with this somewhat bitter aftertaste that wasn't very pleasant. Besides that, I would definitely buy these again."
"These pods are rather bland. I purchased them because I thought they would make a nice dessert coffee. They do not taste much different than regular coffee pods. I would not purchase them again, nor do I recommend them."
"I was disappointed when I received this bonsai desert rose for a number of reasons.<br /><br />First, the packaging.  I have mail ordered other bonsai so was disappointed at how much dirt came out during the unwrapping process.  I would highly recommend you unwrap outdoors, perhaps on grass where you don't care about the dirt.<br /><br />Second, the bonsai I received is not the one shown, or even really much like it.  I was hoping for the gnarled, twisted root and trunk look in the picture.  What I received was basically a fat trunk, no gnarls, no twists.  There are feeder roots coming off the trunk almost 3 inches above the dirt level.  The base does not seem firmly rooted in the pot at all.  In fact, if you grasp the trunk, you can easily lift the entire rootball out of place, without disturbing much of the surrounding soil or decorative pebbles.  Almost like it was just shoved into the pot for shipping to me.  It was advertised as suitable for a beginner, but I am going to have to do some quick research and see about repotting it more securely into the pot.  Far from what I was hoping for.<br /><br />Third, the plant ccame with a sheet of general instructions, not specific to this type of plant.  The first paragraph tells you how vitally important a humidity tray is for the plant's well being.  Why not add $7 to the price and include the darn thing rather than making me call in a separate order and pay for more shipping.<br /><br />Fourth, who the heck is Sheryl?  I made this purchase based on another review which mentioned how nice Sheryl was to deal with on a problem.  This shipment came from Lou's Bonsai--no Sheryl in sight.  Not that it really matters, but it seems odd.<br /><br />I have been bitten by the bonsai bug hard and intend to purchase more, but I most likely will not buy another bonsai from this seller.  There are other sellers available on Amazon and over the internet that will ship you exactly what you see in the picture, rooted into their pots appropriately, etc.  I gave the review two stars because the plant itself seems basically healthy."
"One of my two male Shih-tzus absolutely LIVES for his Greenie which he knows he gets to have after our morning walk, so they are an item that I cannot run out of! I haven't tasted the myself, not being a dog, and they do not smell good to me, either, but I buy these regularly and the ones I purchased here are the best price I have seen!"
"The chips were great...for the first few bags. However, after the first bag or two, I noticed that the remaining bags were damaged. There were holes in each bag and black, sticky stains on the outside. Other reviewers who bought around the same time that I did are now claiming that they found rodent holes in their bags of chips.<br /><br />The chips came in a sealed Kettle box, so it's hard to say who screwed up. But someone somewhere screwed up. These chips were a health hazard before the holes in the bag. Now? It's like a game of roulette."
"What's in this stuff?  Where's the list of ingredients?<br /><br />I don't eat anything unless I know and approve of what's in it.<br /><br />For example, although this product's description says it contains no sugar, it does not say if it contains any artificial sweeteners, which are also bad for you.<br /><br />For one thing, aside from tasting awful, artificial sweeteners often cause horrendous intestinal cramps and diarrhea.<br /><br />In addition to having long ago given up the eating of sugar and sugar in all its guises (e.g: ""natural"" cane juice, fruit juices, ""raw"" sugar, ""organic"" sugar, etc.), I also stopped ingesting artificial sweeteners of any kind.<br /><br />So, what's in this stuff?"
The plant was upside down in the box and I had to put the roots back inside the planter.  It never came out of shock and turned black and died.
"Well, I wasn't sure about this toy, what with the mixed reviews, but Wilson the Beagle was all out of toys so we had to get him something. He's terrible about destroying soft toys. He's very active (he's a beagle!) and we needed something to keep his attention for more than a few seconds. This is it! What a winner! Wilson loves the tug a jug! At first he was puzzled by it. Of course, since he's a hound, he was following his nose, and his nose was telling him there was food in that jug but how in the heck was he supposed to get to it? He tried a few ways and then walked away frustrated. I showed him how the kibble would actually come out the hole and he was hooked. He spent half a day figuring it out. Sometimes I give him his entire meal in the tug-a -jug and let him work it out of there. He's a very high energy dog. He loves a challenge. I'm so grateful for this toy slash dogsitter!"
Alot of moms like me like this item because our babies have no constapation on it i love it very much.
"Believe the reviews--this is seriously awesome--I didn't miss the wheat at all, better than the mixes I've used that had gluten beyond a doubt--the only thing its missing is a scoop of vanilla ice cream!  I am a newly diagnosed Celiac, and am so grateful I have something to bake and share with friends and family!"
"I bought Himalayan Organic Salt twice. Each time, quality was really good and service was fast and courteous (The Spice Lab's). I will buy it again."
"I like this toy.  My puppy dog cant figure it out yet, but she is young yet. I have confidence she will get the object of the toy.... I had gotten another bottle, but the larger one.  THAT bottle was the same size as the dog.  Well safe to say the sister and her much larger dog now have the bottle, my pup me and my leibkins now have the smaller one."
"This is for the regular flavor...<br />I give it zero starts, it was so bad.<br />Hard to believe this is food, and really hard to believe all of the good reviews.  I felt like I was eating packing material, and it left a slimy, yucky residue in my mouth.  Totally disgusting.  BBQ Stix are way better!"
"I've heard about these chips for a while now and thought they would be a good alternative to regular chips. I couldn't eat them though, they just don't taste good to me personally. My grandmother loved them though and I gave the rest to her."
Have you ever try bbq chicken wings?<br />Use this glase and it would be delicious.<br />I used it a lot but usually bought it in super market. today I didn't find it there so I came online and order more here price is much better here.
I use honey in my tea and I was hoping to reduce the carbs with this.  It is actually the opposite.  Both honey and agave have the same carbs per tablespoon and I have to use twice as much as this to get the same sweetness.
Great taste Like it better than the regular.  We use this product in the office break room.  Will order this creamer again.
"The product description says it's ""just juice, bubbles and Vitamin C."" Doesn't that sound good? I decided to try the Kiwi-Berry flavor, but anyone reading this review should know that The Switch is not the sort of product I buy, and my opinion may be influenced by that fact.<br /><br />The good points: It's got a nice gentle fizz. And yes, it's juice, made from concentrates. Sparkling water and apple and grape juice concentrates head the list of ingredients. All natural, which presumably makes it healthier than soda. No added sugar (BUT see below, how could they possibly add any more?) And it's fortified with 100% of the Daily Value of Vitamin C. Not being clear about the term Daily Value (DV), I looked it up and found that it's a dietary reference including -- well, let's just say that it includes the information formerly given by the U.S. RDA (Recommended Daily Allowance) but you have to do some math.<br /><br />The not-so-good points: Sugar, 33 grams. Carbs, 34 grams. Calories, 135. All that packed into a slim 8 ounce can, not really enough of it to quench much of a thirst. No taste of kiwifruit that I could notice. Not a crisp natural taste, and way too sweet for me. I had to dilute the last third of it with water.<br /><br />I didn't fall in love with The Switch and won't be switching to it. It may have a place as an energy drink, but that's too much sugar for children or for anyone, really. Do yourself a favor: eat an orange and drink a glass of cold filtered water. You'll enjoy it more and your body will thank you.<br /><br />Linda Bulger, 2009"
I just got a Keurig coffee maker as a gift and bought this variety pack just to get a small sample of the coffee they offer. Excellent flavors!! Will definitely buy again!
"i didnt know what to expect when i tried these..they were recommended to my a friend who loves them.<br />she was right-they are light, tasty and easy on the pocket. worth trying"
"We tried these chips because DR. OZ had recommended them on his show as a healthier potato chip alternative.  My whole family loves them, we have not found a flavor that we don't like.  These are WAY better than any baked style chip.  Try them and you won't be disappointed!"
"We got the Tug-a-Jug this morning and have used it twice to dispense my dog's breakfast and dinner. She never quite figured out the ""tug"" method of getting the food out, but she did find ways to get the food out by nosing it around on the floor and grabbing the kibble out with her tongue when it reached the neck of the bottle. However, she gave up this morning with about half her breakfast still in there, which is surprising because she LIVES for food! For dinner  she started crying at the bottle because she got so frustrated with it! I never heard her do that before, so I decided to help her a little. However, when I wasn't watching she chewed all the way through the rope. It's still a usable toy, but I guess she'll never figure out the ""tug"" method now. It's been about 50 min and she's still working to get all of her dinner out, so I guess I'd say this is a good toy. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of 5 stars is I think you could use one of your old Nalgene bottles and put dog food in it and it would work the same way. The jug is made of Nalgene I think."
The item was delivered here in great condition. My 5 month old American Eskimo likes the tug a jug even without any treats or kibble inside. But after a few uses a small piece of the bottom lid chipped off. My puppy didn't even play roughly with it. It could have been dangerous if he ate it. Luckily I was there.
This product was purchased at a good price. The product shipped and arrived rather quickly. I really enjoy the mild flavor of folders lively Columbian
"I bought a poper from Discount Tommy a few years back, and have ordered and used there popcorn since. It pops easily and completely every time. I prefer the premixed packaging as it's already measured and ready to go. Also makes storage much easier."
"This is one of the best new products I have ever tried in a long time.....These are delicious chips, they taste like chips, ( not styrofoam) and are all natural !<br />The Barbeque are outstanding, as are the plain, sour creme and onion, salt and pepper. I don't love the Cheddar or the Salt and vinegar, they are a bit strong.<br /><br />If you are on weight watchers each bag is 2 points, and are a great find to cover the crunchy/salty crave, If you are not on weight watchers, you will still enjoy them. My husband loves them, my co-workers love them, kids love them. They can not believe their Mom is allowing them to eat a bag of chips a day!<br /><br />Overall an excellent product !"
"I tried the Martha White Turtle Fudge Chocolate Chip Cookie recipe and these are the worst cookies I have ever made. Either there is someone on the staff of Martha White who has a lopsided sense of humor OR their taste buds have taken a permanent vacation. I wasted my time, a lot of money on chocolate and pecans,and my effort.Martha White either needs to tweek this recipe or take it off the website so no other unsuspecting housewife will waste her money and time on these worthless cookies. My husband picked up one on his way through the kitchen and within two seconds he came back in and threw it in the garbage."
"Sea salt is more easily administered with a salt mill. This is just a salt shaker that delivers uncontrollable amounts of sea salt and anti-caking agent into your food, and no iodide. The anti-caking agent isn't event that effective, so the salt either comes out in clumps or gets stuck at the exit. Stay away!"
Worked very little. Sweetened fresh pineapple but changed the taste to a bit bitter.<br />A sour orange it did help. It didn't work on anything else at all.
It almost has a chocolate aftertaste - and it is nice! I'm on my second bag (actually bought a single bag to try and then a multi-bag purchase).  Now this isn't a french roast but it is fairly dark and the taste is beyond most. Try a single bag and take it from there._steve
"This tea is awesome, and also way cheaper from amazon than from the official website. All my friends that try it are hooked."
"I became addicted to eating these the first time I tasted them which was years ago. Once you eat one, you just can't stop until they're gone. They aren't too sweet and make the perfect snack. I love these things!!!"
"I have a hard time finding hazelnuts for a decent price, but this pack of six 8oz. bags is a great value. The nuts are fresh and taste delicious. I always keep a bag of these in my pantry for cooking."
"SWEET POTATO<br />Pros:<br />- Amazing Taste<br />- Good packaging, almost no chips ever broken, all full shape.<br />- Great nutrition for such a tasty chip (hardly any salt)<br />- Perfect serving in the bag<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Hard to open the bag<br /><br />These chips are now my favorite brand, especially these sweet potato ones.  Since the order comes in a big ""retail box"" that comes with a count of 24, i gave them to out to friends and coworkers.  EVERY SINGLE PERSON was blown away by the taste.  Ironically, every person also commented on how hard it was to open the actual package. :)  Now the next dilemma is trying to decide... should i buy the sweet potato ones since they were so good, or try another flavor.<br /><br />For the current asking price, it is actually cheaper than buying other branded chips at the store.  Once again, these things blew my mind in that chips could be so good."
"Like most instant oatmeal, this ended up being a lot like baby cereal in texture and way too thin if you don't cut back on the amount of water called for.  One packet barely does anything to put a dent in your hunger.  The taste was just okay and not as good as other instant oatmeals I've tried.<br /><br />You can cook quick oats in the microwave in about the same time, add your own brown sugar and cinnamon and a bit of salt, and it will taste worlds better.  Make it with milk instead of water, and it will be even richer.  I might use these instant oatmeal packets on a road trip, but other than that I'd rather make my own on the stovetop.  For the extra few minutes, it's worth the greatly improved taste and texture."
"I've been getting these treats for the last year for my two senior dogs.  Both have had various hip and joint problems in the past, but have not had any problems since they've been taking these.  And they love them!  I've tried all the flavors, and have not had a problem with them eating it.  They think it's a yummy treat, and get excited when I pull them out.  I would definitely recommend for anyone with older dogs."
"An excellent product! ... and this particular brand seems to be better than others I have tried in the past. It has a very fresh flavor and can be used in a large variety of ways. It is pure and very tasty when used just as an oil on salads or vegetables, too. The unbreakable ""tin"" container sits in the back corner of my cooking counter and is also used whenever I'm not sure what ingredient I should add next in a recipe preparation! Very nice and well worth the bargain price offered by Amazon and the manufacturer."
Wheat nuts are hard to find in the stores. I was glad to find them on line.  I am very satisfied with the product and  having received them quickly.  Thankyou for such great service.
"This is a close second to my all-time favorite, Jack Links Beef Steakhouse Steaks, which is the filet mignon of beef jerky. They're very similar in taste and price, but the Steakhouse edges out this one oh so slightly. Still pretty awesome jerky, very tender, and not a hint of fat or gristle. Bon appetit!"
Walnut oil is an essential ingredient in our favorite waffle batter. This oil is the best we've used for the price. GREAT aroma!!!
"I tried it, but I just didn't like it.  Not a good tasting sugar substitute in my opinion.  I'd rather do without sugar than use this again."
"This is expensive for a 50 lb bag.  I looked around for a long time, found that it was the most economical at cos*co, one of the membership stores.  It isn't available at the regular warehouses, but at 'cos*co business' store.  You don't need to have a business membership card to go there.  Price - $ 14.21 for a 25 lb bag, I live in Phoenix, AZ and there is one such store near I-17 and Indian School road.<br />J"
"I agree with other reviews that the taste is good. But the image on the package suggests mostly lentils with some sauce. It's not, it's mostly sauce with few lentils. You could fix this by adding some canned lentils, but you shouldn't have to. See my picture. It's like a broth with a tablespoon on beans."
"Yogi's Breathe Deep is an OK tea for those of us who have asthma and other respiratory ailments. It's a blend of eucalyptus, thyme, and peppermint. Eucalyptus has clearing qualities, but the thyme and peppermint... are kind of mild. Thyme is one of those laidback Gallic herbs (it's in Herbes de Provence blends) Yogi Tea's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CMIYX6"">Yogi Cold Season, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)</a> is MUCH stronger, since it blends eucalyptus with the heady herbs of cinnamon, clove, and cardamom. Breathe Deep is great... but Cold Season has amazing clearing qualities."
This coffee is only mediocre in quality. I do not like a highly acidic coffee nor do I like it when the coffee outdates within 6 weeks of the order date. The only reason I am not more dissatified with this lousy coffee is that I paid very little for it by using a credit I had at amazon payments. I do not recommend this coffee.
"The label says that this product is made by removing the water AND FAT from peanuts. Have you ever tried those natural peanut butters where you have to mix in the oil which floats on top? Have you ever poured off that oil and tasted what remains? Nasty like sawdust, isn't it? That's because nearly all the good peanut flavor is contained in that oil. This product doesn't have that oil, so it is hugely lacking in flavor. For those who must consume what they perceive as peanut butter, even if it has less than ten percent of real peanut butter flavor, this is the product for you, hence its rating with two stars. I very strongly suspect rating fraud for this item; I can't for a moment believe that such an overwhelming proportion of real consumers rated it so highly.<br /><br />I got to thinking about how this product must be made: Peanut oil is made by pressing peanuts under a crushing weight, then either centrifuging or injecting with water so the oil will float on top for removal. Once the oil is removed, what remains is an industrial waste product which apparently gets put into jars and labeled as ""PB2"" for the suckers among us (which USED to be me, but never again)."
When you taste these you only get the taste of salt. Either the package I got came from the batch Amazon had in storage for long period of time or when they packaged these someone overdozed the salt. I have these only because  the Roland Kalamata Pitted (whole) olives have been out of stock for couple month. As result had to dispose to trash Rolan Kalamata Halves.
safe and tasty treat.i would assume these are like puffed cheetos for dogs. popeye loves them and i get a kick out of hearing him actually crunch and chew instead of woofing down his treats whole and risk getting choked...plus i think these melt in his mouth if the peices are too small for him to crunch.
Just received this butter yesterday and we are already using it to make sandwiches with jelly. Tastes great without having any salt or sugar added. Highly recommend!
Our cats love the grass.  It's easy to grow and it sprouts within a few days so you have an ample supply on hand continually.  An excellent product to maintain a cat's health.
"While some of their other varieties are ok, this one tastes rancid. Also, with any of them, if you reheat the 2nd portion in the container, the plastic coating on the interior crumbles off right into the remaining 'oatmeal' (it is only partially oatmeal!)"
"I have tried SO many gluten-free bread mixes, but this is as close as it gets to regular bread."
"I purchased the baby white by accident.  We usually get the medium white, which is great.  The baby is so small when popped that the taste and texture of the hull shell really overwhelm it."
"First, I have to say my cat loves the Fussie Cat foods. She has a malabsorption problem and switching to Fussie Cat has really helped with the throwing up and loose stools. We've tried almost every variety and am impressed with the quality; hence the 4-star rating. Being able to get this brand with subscribe and save rocks and it saves me a lot of money.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the Tuna with Shrimp case just came and was full of dented, slightly damaged cans. None of the cans have broken open or been punctured, but the dents aren't minor and since these are sold as 'new' I shouldn't be receiving dented cans. Hopefully this is just a one off occurrence."
"Third time I've bought this brand,,,it is STALE,,not gonna bother to return it,,,no second chances, will find another brand. I'm sure another brand offers the same size. To be clear, the first boxes were fresh. Take your best shot."
"I am a self proclaimed coffee guy. I enjoy chatting about coffee with the manager of my local Starbucks. I also have my own burr grinder, French press, espresso maker and 2 drip coffee makers (2 cup and 12 cup). So where does VIA fit into my coffee life? I typically use a VIA packet when I want a quick cup of coffee and don't want to take the time or effort to brew a pot (12 cup or 2 cup coffee makes).<br />Pros:<br />* Fast and convenient.<br />* Taste great for an instant coffee - it is not quite as good as fresh brewed but remarkably better than other instant coffee.<br />Cons:<br />* It is expensive. So watch the price on Amazon it will vary greatly over time. I tell my wife we are not ""Pay the full price people"". Put the item in your cart and then if u have time check your cart daily for a while. (I do this for all Amazon purchases since the price does really fluctuate for most items). For VIA I have found that watching it can save me 50% or more on Amazon - the price of this item locally never changes much.<br />* It is not the same as good brewed coffee. Don't expect this to be the same as fresh brewed coffee - all else constant (I.e. filtered water etc.)"
"It may have 30 fewer calories per packet than the maple-brown sugar instant oatmeal, but you can really taste the missing calories. I can't even eat it hot anymore, the ""apple"" flavor is so weirdly bitter and unpleasant. It makes me hate breakfast."
"After reading the wonderful reviews of PB2, I was still skeptical but every rave review was right on the money!!<br /><br />The reduction in fat and calories is a gift from the peanut butter gods.  The fact that you mix it up as you go (which takes, literally, no more than 15 seconds) is a great help for people like me who sometimes like to settle down with a jar of peanut butter and a spoon, only to realize a zillion calories later what I have done.  You can control the texture by adding or subtracting the water recommended.  There's plenty of peanut flavor and they've added a bit of sugar (I assume to offset the lack of fat) but it is a very small amount and still adds far less in calories than all that subtracted fat and oil.<br /><br />The chocolate PB2 is also completely awesome.  I eat it straight and it's almost like chocolate mousse.  Sometimes I pop in a little regular PB2 if I'm not wanting it so sweet but any way you mix it, it rocks.<br /><br />I ordered and received $100.00 worth and I love the comfort of knowing my PB2 is there for the forseeable future.<br /><br />I hope that the word gets out to all the people who will love this product.<br /><br />Give it a try, you won't be sorry! PB2 Powdered Peanut Butter and Powdered Cocoa Peanut Butter - 85% Less Fat and Calories - 6.5 Oz Each - 2 Pack"
"This is my third order of Popchips.  My husband and I both love them, and he takes a bag in lunch nearly every day.  I shared them with coworkers, also, and they thought they were great.  You won't be disappointed."
"I've been giving these dental chews to my chihuahua mix daily when I leave for work in the morning. She absolutely loves them and looks forward to them. Before I started giving these to her, she would cry when I was leaving, but now she actually gets excited. They don't last too long, but they last long enough for me to leave without her noticing. And these big boxes last for months."
"Actually typed in ""smoked paprika"". This showed up so I ordered it and it is definatly NOT smoked!  Also, these bottles sell for 4.95 at Sam's. So, not only was it the wrong item but, I over paid also!"
"Very tasty chips, healthier alternative to regular chips without compromising on flavor. In fact, the taste is better than most regular chips I've had. Would highly recommend this product! If you had to choose, my favorites were the sea salt and vinegar, followed by salt and pepper. Ironically, the original flavor was my least favorite, probably because I was spoiled by all the flavor the others offer."
I'm sure this Mama Grain is pretty healthy but it taste disgusting. Even my daughter who is not a picky eater refuse to eat this. The combination of sweet banana and beans doesn't go well at all.
"We drink this coconut water every day in our house. It's become somewhat of an obsession. We used to have a subscription to the 12 pack of vitacoco and when that ran out we tried this instead. I like it better. It tastes cleaner though I can't describe what's different about it, I just feel better after drinking this than drinking the vitacoco. Coconut water in general has an odd taste to it but it's still really sweet and feels SO refreshing when you drink it. If I'm really hungry I drink this between meals and it's kind of like a protein shake or energy drink. It settles my stomach and gives me a fantastic burst of energy!"
"My puppy is under 40 pounds, and loved this toy.  He chewed the rope apart in one day.  Well, I unscrewed the bottom and inserted a golf ball.  It did the job of the rope and made it tough to shake out the treats.  Kept the pup occupied for two hours.  Then he figured out that tossing the bottle would shake loose the treats.  the plastic bottle cracked in minutes.<br /><br />This would be an excellent toy if the plastic was tougher.  the design is great, especially with the ball addition."
"I just did a test run for a work party and I sampled raspberries, strawberries, lemons, limes, Tabasco sauce, goats cheese, beer, orange juice, and yogurt. First off, the lemon was the best tasting example of fruit I have ever had in my life. I wanted to eat the whole thing. The rest of the fruits tasted delicious. The unsweetened yogurt was good, the orange juice amazing, and the beer much sweeter. The goats cheese didnt taste that yummy to me and the tabasco sauce didnt have a noticeable change in flavor. Over all, a very fun and effective flavor changing experience!"
"Loose prickly pear tea makes a great iced tea but it is very difficult to find in pure form.  This tea is black tea with prickly pear ""flavor"". The shipping cost is twice the cost of the tea.  If there is a prickly pear component it is all but undetectable when I drink it. It just tastes like regular black tea.  Very disappointing."
My whole family(7 people) tasted all 3 flavors and they are sickly sweet.  Very disappointed that product has sucralose.  I wouldn't buy it again
"I got this as a gift and liked the flavor but I wasn't crazy about the texture.  I like fluffy pancakes and believe it or not, imo, Aunt Jemima's buttermilk ready mix is the best one out there and it's so easy to make.<br />Of course, the best tasting waffles are made by me from scratch with buttermilk and all.=)<br />Overall, I think buying gourmet pancake mix is one of the biggest waste of money.  And it still requires you to put melted butter, milk, etc.<br />I am sticking with my own recipes and Aunt Jemima's if I am in a hurry."
"I have to admit based on most of the reviews I was sold on getting the 48 pack.  Was a mistake. All three flavors had a distinct taste of the sucralose.  That is the name of the artificial sweetner, in the product.  If you like Splenda,you may like this.  But, it has a distinct taste. Unfortunately not for me. A few friends of mine that tried it and said,""It wasn't bad."" Unfortunately, that was the best of the comments.<br />If you really want a good cup of hot chocolate try Cafe Escapes or Swiss Miss.  Both are twice as good in my opinion. Liked the Escapes best.  Wish I liked the artificial sweetner, but the that taste has a distinct after taste. Probably would be better without the artificial stuff and more regular sugar. If your going to order I would get the small pack to try it.  Better then throwing out 30.  Try Cafe Escapes and Swiss Miss and see for yourself."
"they decided to ship both my order in ONE HUGE box of 24 cans instead of 12 green beans in one box, 12 corn in another and i was barely able to get this inside my house.  then every single can of green beans was dented and 3 cans of corn were dented"
"Love this coffee!  It is my everyday go to coffee when I want plain, non-flavored coffee.  I actually use one k-cup to make a medium and a small in a large coffee cup.  I find this strength perfect.  Amazon has the best price and I love the packaging of the 50-count package.  Recycle the one box--very little waste!"
Very nice product<br />full of quality items - not the cheap candies like other baskets
"These tasty little gummi candy strawberries come from Germany and are not to be confused with our inferior gummi worm type candy in the States.  Great consistency, awesome flavor, and sweet deal for this quantity.  Once your friends and family try them, you'll need 10 pounds of them to make sure you get a few.  If you haven't eaten these, you haven't lived."
"Check out the following site for great deals on all things Japanese Food Basesd. ""Asian Food Grocer"".xom I used an ""X"" on purpose to prevent the filter.<br /><br />This particular item is listed for 1.72 & shipping is usualy $5 on orders over 25, or free on black friday, standard shipping is ~7-8 I think.<br /><br />Anyways I would order by phone their web forum sometimes doesn't take the order.<br /><br />Long story short. Better prices, same service, worse interface."
"this egg pasta ingredient was ""powdered egg product"" and as such not as tasty as those containing the real thing.  i don't like anything powdered, but price was RIGHT.  can't have it all i guess."
"I've been Paleo for six months, as has my partner. We both found these inedible. All four kinds (which, by the way, taste nearly the same).<br /><br />I'm not sure what it is about them either. It seems like they would be good from the ingredients. But something about the combination of flavors just does not taste good. I kept trying them again, hoping that they would grow on me. They sure didn't. We finally tossed them.<br /><br />So, I would advise getting just one from a local co-op or something before you buy a whole bunch online. I sure which I had."
"You have to get kitty used to them, as they are kinda rubbery, and smell funny. My cat took to the treats well, after a bit of coaxing; and sometimes if she doesn't eat them, I just pinch them in half, and she gobbles them up. My cat is equally fond of both flavors, salmon and chicken; If I don't store them away properly, the next morning I find the pouch torn and chewed up.<br /><br />This is a great treat if you can't/don't grow cat grass."
"love this honey , the best i,ve ever had , will be ordering more and often ..try it you,ll love this stuff , great for afternoon slumps , great pick me up ....hmmmm tastes so good"
I wish I had come to the Amazon site before purchasing this product at my local Wegman's. The 'Product Of China' was printed so small it was easy to overlook. I am a little shocked that Wegman's (a local chain store known for quality) was selling these 'treats' in a big display. The half open package is going in the trash and unopened bag is going back to Wegman's for a refund and a piece of my mind.
I bought this as a gift.  He liked it very much.<br />It came in good condition and good time.<br />I rate it AAAA++++
"Some of the other reviewers noted that they still had reactions to this product.  Look at the ingredients - any sort of hydrolyzed vegetable protein contains MSG.  This is a trick used by most companies in the food industry.  There are like 25 different names for MSG- or free glutamate-containing substances, and they just hide it under a different name  (Google ""Other Names for MSG"" and you will be appalled).  Unfortunately the FDA does not require any real disclosure on labels - MSG can also be labeled simply as ""spices"" or ""natural flavors.""  It's safe to go ahead and assume that any flavor base seasoning such as that used here will have some type of MSG in it.  If another processed product such as flavor base is used in creating a new product, the ingredients in the component product (e.g., flavor base)are not required to be disclosed on the label. At least this manufacturer had the decency to list what was in the flavor base."
"My mother and father were the recipient of these wonderful pieces of chocolate heaven.  They didn't believe they deserved receiving these, but I know they did deserve to receive these!"
"Maybe the miracle fruit does not work for everyone. It had very little effect when I used it. I started with a clear pallet, let the pill dissolve on my tongue etc. Then I tried the classic first, a lime. I noticed, barely, that it was not quite as pucker inducing as it may have been without the mberry but just slightly. And it did not add any ""sweet"". It just inhibited a hint of sour. Other foods like vinegar, vinegar chips, Guinness, strawberries, cheese, etc. Many recommended fruits and foods have very little impact. And after just a few minutes, I could notice any change.<br /><br />So, either, some people just don't have the same level of effect or much of the miracle berry effects are group dynamics and heightened suggestibility. Either way, they were a let down."
"My cat has an iron stomach. She can eat absolutely anything and everything and is always getting into my ""human"" food and has never thrown up. I gave her 2 of these treats and within 20 minutes, she was wheezing and throwing up all over my carpet. I didn't connect it at first but when I gave her the same treats the next day, exact same reaction!<br /><br />I have tried several different flavors of this same brand and she has had the same reaction! If you are trying these with your cat for the 1st time, only give them 1 of them and just wait to see how they react before you give them anymore."
This is a great tasting Breakfast Blend. I have been drinking it every since I purchased my new coffee maker. I will be buying more of it in the near future. Great way to start my stressful day.
"I have used  various sports supplements over the years in biking, skiing and hockey. None created any problems. I decided to try the Sports Beans and use them when I do my 4 hour road bike rides. They would have been more convient and bulky then food or other products. I comsumed three bags. I noticed no energy benefit and in fact road only three hours instead of four. The worst was yet to come. At 2 am in the morning I awoke with severe teeth acres. This product had caused my teeth to become infected and I ended up going an Urgent Care for pain meds and amoxicillin. Looking closely at the ingredients the top two are EVAPORATED CANE JUICE and TAPIOCA SYRUP. Jelly Belly is a candy company not into sports nutrition and that's what this product is. Candy misrepresented as a sports supplement. BEWARE. Avoid unless you have bullet proof teeth. Many better and safer products on the market."
I adopted both my girls from shelters and they were eating regular old dog food. Their coats were dull...but  didn't realize how dull until they started eating the AvoDerm. This stuff is amazing. They love it and their coats are so soft and bright.
"""These are delicious! The chocolate is excellent and the espresso bean was the perfect roast for this purpose. Crunchy and not bitter.""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00067AD4U"">Chocolate Covered Espresso Beans 5 Pounds</a>"
"This steak rub is spectacular. I rub it liberally on steak (usually NY strip), let is sit for a while and then grill.  It has been getting rave reviews and we are already on our 3rd jar. I wish they would sell it in bigger jars. Amazon's price is a bit high though."
This ghee has a richness and depth of flavor that I have found in no other ghee. It is so very yummy that I don't even consider buying cheaper brands. I value that it's from grass fed cows too. Great product!
"I ordered this Chai because of the reviews I read expecting a yummy taste comparable to chai products purchased in Starbucks or gourmet drink establishments.  I followed the instructions using 3 heaping teaspoons, and mixed it with hot milk first, and then experimented by mixing it next in hot water, and again in half and half combination of hot water and hot milk.  I even have mixed it with hot water and used it with a chai tea bag for a stronger taste.  I am not getting the spicey taste I desired but the product is good.  It's just not AS good.  I am not certain if I will reorder.  What I like about the product -- you can use it just with hot water and it is good."
"Great variety of fruits, and my 8 month old loved them all. We bought this assortment pack as well as the vegetable one and it lasted well over two weeks."
"This product is excellent. It's also a nut snack that my wife, who has celiac disease, and is allergic to wheat and glueton can enjoy. I however can eat anything and this is the tastiest and most unique nut snack I've ever tried.  Al & Virginia Weatherly  53996 Luzerne Dr. Macomb, Mi 48042"
"I didn't care for Kiwi Berry Switch. It was very sweet and not refreshing at all. Also, at 135 calories in an 8.3 ounce can, it actually contains a lot more calories than regular soda. I know it is all natural and doesn't have HFC (High Fructose Corn Syrup), and I appreciate that, but it also doesn't have much actual kiwi or berry juices. The drink is VERY sweet, but sweeter than 100% fruit juice, sweeter even than your average can of soda. I can't say I would ever buy this product or recommend it to anyone else. There are better natural sodas on the market, as well as better 100% natural juices."
I used quotes around the word tea because I doubt that the bags contain tea.  I wouldn't be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea.  I would not give this product a single star; it deserves zero stars in my opinion.<br />This tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star.
"Here is the skinny on using this as camping food: get some reflectix insulation and make a cozy for your pot with lid. bring pot to boil, dump this box of dried beans and rice in, stir and take off heat to put in cozy. Wait about half an hour and it is ready - saves on fuel because the simmer time is about 23 minutes over low flame.<br /><br />Everyone LOVES this stuff. At home or on the trail. Add a pouch of tuna while in the woods (and maybe some dried hot peppers - pepin in the mexican section) and eat it with flour tortillas and I personally promise HEAVEN in your mouth!"
"I of course prefer freshly made espresso but sometimes instant is good in a pinch.  I travel around Europe extensively and there are several brands available there which aren't at all bad.  This brand is OK for using it as a coffee flavoring in custards, etc., but as a beverage, it rates rock bottom in my book."
"I was sent English Breakfast tea in a Decaf Earl Grey Box.  The incorrect k-cups were in the wrong box and strewn haphazardly in the box.  It seemed rather unprofessional, like someone had just thrown what they had in their kitchen in a box and sent to me.  I am not happy to say the least.  Amazon customer service was wonderful and refunded me."
"I recently bought an 8 ounce home popper and had read favorable reviews about the pre-packaged kernels, coconut oil, and salt packets.  After scouring Amazon and reading the reviews, I finally settled on Great Northern.<br /><br />The packaged shipped immediately within a day of purchase and arrived on schedule.  Be warned that based on the climate in your area, the oil portion in the packets may be solidified or liquid.  Regardless, it melts instantly in a hot kettle if you receive it solid.<br /><br />As for the taste, I was not disappointed one bit.  Some reviews have mentioned that it is too salty, but I found it just right.  I do prefer salty foods, though.  Based on the look of it, I thought it would turn the popcorn a ridiculous yellow hue, but it didn't.  The taste was exactly like you'd get at the theater or ballpark and it was not too greasy.  I highly recommend this product for anyone looking to make theater style popcorn at home."
"my german shepherd loves these.  he's very picky about both his food and treats so it was a relief to find something he likes.  the package recommends giving him 4-6/day but that seems excessive--usually two or three throughout the day makes him happy.  they are in small strips, much like jerky--much less disgusting than some of his other treats, such as pigs feet/ears.  i will definitely continue to purchase."
"I am celiac and have been keeping a strictly gluten-free diet for over six years, and was excited to learn about this product.  After eating it, [the taste and texture was not bad] I became sick in the way that I always do when ingesting gluten. Nana's also makes non-gluten products, and clearly are not careful about cross-contamination.  If you are concerned about ingesting gluten or keeping a strictly celiac diet, I strongly recommend you avoid this product.  I also think that the company should not deceive their customers, many who suffer from celiac disease, and should more clearly label their product as it is a danger to the health of many who would be inclined to buy this product."
"I've tasted many varieties of Earl Grey tea, and I would have to say this one is the best. When they mention that this product has a ""bergamot citrus"" aroma, they surely don't mess around. It indeed packs a nice, powerful punch. Upon opening it, I almost had to catch my breath. My grandmother could even smell it across the room. Very delightful and very strong in its flavor and fragrance. This tea is powerful enough in strength to where it eliminates the need to use a lot of leaves. I feel that it will last me for quite some time. When you add the fact that it's kosher, fair trade, and USDA certified organic, I feel all the more better about it."
"What's in this stuff?  Where's the list of ingredients?<br /><br />I don't eat anything unless I know and approve of what's in it.<br /><br />For example, although this product's description says it contains no sugar, it does not say if it contains any artificial sweeteners, which are also bad for you.<br /><br />For one thing, aside from tasting awful, artificial sweeteners often cause horrendous intestinal cramps and diarrhea.<br /><br />In addition to having long ago given up the eating of sugar and sugar in all its guises (e.g: ""natural"" cane juice, fruit juices, ""raw"" sugar, ""organic"" sugar, etc.), I also stopped ingesting artificial sweeteners of any kind.<br /><br />So, what's in this stuff?"
After reading a previous review I carefully inspected the cans when they arrived. The cans were immaculate and very clean so I felt relieved. After cooling in the fridge I ate the first can. The fruit was very mushy and not attractive to look at and frankly a disapointment but did not taste rotten per say. Only minutes later though my mouth felt like acid was eating at it and was very painful for hours even after washing out my mouth. I eat much canned and fresh fruit and this was a first for me. Only days later my teeth and gums were infected and I had to go to the dentist for the pain was so bad. He found infection and I had to undergo a treatment of antibiotics and painkillers before I was finally ok again after about 2 weeks. SHEESH! Needless to say I threw out the remaining cans of fruit! The problem must be at the source as the cans and packaging were 1st rate and shining clean. Quality control must really suck. I'm all for natural but great care must be taken so contamination is avoided. This is a foreign product and their health standards may be lacking there. I would stay far away from this stuff if you value your health!
"Fresh in the barrel and that's the way they stay. The screw top lid keeps them as fresh as the day they arrived. A very hearty pretzle. Not as thin as pretzel sticks, but not as thick as a pretzel rod. Just the right in between. Fresh tasting and not too much salt.<br /><br />Unless you are having a party, one barrel will go a long way. I bought two barrels to save 10% and ended up sending one baarrel to my company's office. Really a lot of pretzels for the money. Will buy them again."
"I like this 'Orange Tangerine' more than the other two of these drinks I reviewed previously: it tastes probably the least sweet of all three, but still a little too sweet-carbonated for me.  It advertises 'no sugar added' and '100% juice carbonated' and 'no preservatives', so I was expecting some sweet ~ this drink tastes like carbonated, watered-down orange juice, but it's actually a pretty good flavor, and packs 140 calories, 34g sugar and 36g carbs in a 'no sugar added'-'no corn syrup'- 'no preservatives'-'no artificial colors'-'gluten free' drink!  I would expect that from a juice like apple or cranberry, but I would also expect it to TASTE a bit more natural, and this one, like I said above, tastes like carbonated orange juice with tangerine ~ it's nice tasting, but too much in the way of calories & such for me to drink this very often.<br /><br />It was certainly good, but for the tastebuds of someone who WAS a lifelong soda drinker (diet soda for the past 12 years), and gave up soda a year ago(I very occasionally drink a carbonated beverage now) this is not the drink for me.  I mostly drink water, milk, iced tea, hot tea & coffee now, and this sweet tasting, sugary tasting beverage, had way too much carbonation & flavoring for me!  The orange tangerine flavors were nice but still TASTED fake, which is weird for a drink that touts things like '100% juice' and a label that says 'natural flavors'...I would recommend this product only to those who like somewhat sweet, fruitie carbonated beverages...enjoy!"
I bought these at Grocery Outlet here in the Seattle Tacoma are for $4.00 a case of tweleve not paying $38.00 Yes 3 for a dollar. I like the taste not great but not bad either low calorie will buy more but not at this whacked out price.
Nasty smell; I went back to Virbac dental chews. My dogs preferred the V. and even act like they're treats.
"This coffee tastes great, a strong flavor without the bitterness found in other dark roasts!"
I've only been able to find this gum on Amazon for a good price & free shipping.
"I love fresh squeezed grapefruit juice. Most grapefruit drinks just don't taste like the real thing. I saw a 6-pack of San Pellegrino Pompelmo at the local Fresh Market and thought I'd give it a try. After having several cans, I have to say it is terrific. It is made with 16% grapefruit juice and, unlike most other grapefruit drinks, has a genuine grapefruit flavor. If you like their Limonata and also like grapefruit juice, I think you will enjoy this."
"This price is nearly 3 times more than any other site you can find it on.  5 stars is for the product, I would rate the seller at a price gouging 1 star."
"I ordered these lollipops for a friends Wizard of Oz themed shower. The arrived packaged well but I noticed the box said they're from ""Oriental Trading Company"".  If I wanted a cheap product that I knew was low quality and from China then I would have bought them directly from their site at $7 for 38 of them!!! However, from the picture these looked well made. The picture is very deceiving and so is the description. They show 16 same-colored lollipops...mine came in a variety of colors. They also gave dimentions that the lollipops were 6""x2"". I noticed they looked a bit small and when I measured they didn't even come to 5"" long, not any of them...even though they're all differnet lengths.  This was very disappointing since I planned to stand them up in a vase of lemon drops. Overall, I'm very disappointed in this product and the seller for not being honest about the product they're providing to consumers."
"I know Oreos are celebrating 100 years, and I feel badly about it, but I've had to switch loyalties.  Somewhere along the line they've changed and I am not as fond of them.  I tried the Newman's gluten free version last year when I became Vegan.  Surprise!  These are Vegan friendly as well, not to mention organic if you care about such things.  They are crisper and have a better tasting filling than Oreos (I just bought a bag last week so I did the side by side taste test.) They freeze beautifully (and they are even better frozen by the way.)  I buy them on the subscribe and save plan and am well please with the service.  Note there is some breakage in shipping, but who doesn't have a use for chocolate cookie crumbs?  Love these cookies. I use them with these molds http://www.amazon.com/Wilton-Hearts-Cookie-Candy-Mold/dp/B001CEG9Z8/ref=pd_sim_k_1  and Wilton Candy Melts to make fun gifts and party treats. Don't miss the Newman's Ginger'Os if you like ginger cookies, they are a winner too."
"My wife, just today, bought a 12 oz pkg of this at our grocery story for $8.50. The cost here seems like price-gauging."
I've found that going gluten and sugar free has been a real challenge. Some products have helped and this has been one of them. I've used this as a substitute in recipes when calling for brown sugar (and have had to guess a bit about quantity) and it has worked well. I recently made a pumpkin bread using it and the whole family enjoyed! Warning: the bottle top does get sticky and feels a bit crumbly from the honey that can remain on it. To avoid this I have stopped using the flip top and simply remove the top entirely to measure out the honey I need.
"My son is 7 months old and this has always been his favorite baby food - it is nice a thick, which he loves!"
"It pains me to have to disagree with reviewer K.Wessel. The information in that review is incorrect. This product is healthy for cats. Maybe not so for humans, but healthy for the digestive tract of a cat. My five year old Siamese neutered male is stupendously healthy, satisfied and very happy. He has maintained his exact weight for three consecutive years. We have his vet records to back up these statements. His vet is happy, his mom is happy, and best of all he (Tu'i Tonga) is happy. If you have questions, please consult your vet. A cats digestive needs are much different than a humans. The ingredients may sound awful to us, but it's not our health we should be concerned with when buying pet food."
"I have a 6 pound toy poodle and she would be very depressed without her daily ration of greenies.  She knows that after supper she receives her greenie and she loves them.  It is the one thing that I can depend on her eating.  Since we do feed a lot of soft food, the greenie helps clean her teeth.  The price on these greenies is very good and they were fresh and came in a timely manner."
"I typically get the brownie crunch flavor, but happened to grab one of these white chocolate chip bars by accident.  It was a good accident.  These are really good.  I actually think I like them better than the brownie crunch. I usually don't like anything white chocolate because it's overly sweet, but this isn't.  I typically buy my bars at whole foods, but they are quite expensive.  I may start buying them on amazon.  Only downside is that you can't pick and choose what you'd like in a box on amazon.<br /><br />The Good:<br />The ingredients seem pretty good as well.  Nothing screams to me as a scary lab created chemical.  It's got a good amount of fiber, lots of protein and no added sugar or fake sugar (a big pet peeve of mine). It tastes very good in comparison to some other ""healthy protein bars"" out there that taste like chalk and smell like feet.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />It does have more calories and carbs than I would like to see in this size bar. 240 calories & a whopping 27 grams of carbs."
"As soon as my dogs hear that I open the box they come running.  They absolutely love these chews! Don't know what it is, but they're irresistable to my dogs!"
"After reading some of the reviews, I got nervous and opened a bag from my recent order expecting the worst! No worries here. All bags are in great shape and expiration dates aren't until June. Chips, at least from the first bag, taste like they are supposed to and all is good in the world! By the way, fifteen bags for under thirty dollars is a ton less expensive than the going price around here at the local grocery store so, yay team!"
"I love Sky Blue sodas. And when I saw the Creamy Root Beer, as someone who loves all root beer, I ordered a case. Got it today, chilled a six pack for a few hours. Then poured one in a glass. Tasted it. Almost vomited. And then proceeded to dump them all down the drain. Horrible, horrible taste. I don't get how this can taste so bad, and all the others are so so good."
"I bought a two pack at the Friday sale for $20.  Reasonable, but not an amazing deal.  I've been pleasantly surprised by the taste.  I do like the Van whatever flavor French Vanilla K-cups, and this contains significantly milder flavoring of a good tasting coffee.<br />I would and have served it to company and highly recommend serving with milk or cream.<br /><br />If you like flavored coffees, you'll most likely enjoy this one.  If you like it plain and black, you'll probably hate this."
These chips are thick and crunchy.  I absolutely love them.  The taste is perfect.  I like to buy these smaller bags because I cant trust myself with a large bag of these because they taste no good.
"I love the Tofu Shirataki noodles (angel hair, spaghetti & fettucini). I eat 2 bags most days. Very filling and only 40 calories. I am not much of a cook. I prefer the simplest of methods to cook. I rinse off quickly in cool water, then throw on a non-stick frying pan. I used to use Olive Oil but have found I don't need that, either. I sprinkle with Mrs. Dash or Vogue vegetarian chicken base. Just stir for a couple of minutes to get some of the water out. It's great. Last night I brought an unopened bag to a Cajun restaurant with me, and they agreed to cook with it in place of the traditional pasta that was supposed to come with my meal. The owner was surprised how much it tasted like pasta. For breakfast I sometimes use a little Almond Milk and Stevia for sweetener. I think they taste GREATTTTT, very very similar to pasta (unlike the shirataki without the tofu that isn't refrigerated and is more gel-like and not as similar to pasta). The product is great for your digestion and fills you up. I often stir-fry one and put into a plastic container with cooked vegetables and reheat for lunch. I'm addicted to House Foods Tofu Shirataki. However, if possible, search at your local grocery stores. The shipping online is expensive because it needs to be refrigerated. Highly recommend!!"
"The deal I got on these was amazing so that, combined with the fact that I love this brand of Almonds made ordering these no-brainer. I happen to love all of Blue Diamond's different flavors for their almonds. This flavor - Smokehouse is the best IMO. It's got just the right amount of smoky flavor to it without being overbearing. I believe this is Blue Diamond's best selling variety of Almonds. These come in 1.5 ounce packages and for me each package is good for 2-3 servings - about a handful each serving. Very tasty"
"Our dog Callie loves these bones and she's VERY picky about flavours(only chicken). It's nice to give her something to ""chew"" on for awhile. They last a long time and are not smelly or greasy.  The price is reasonable and come in quantity options."
"Wow, I wasn't sure what to expect given the mixed reviews.  So, I took other readers suggestions and spiced it up a little.  I added some rice, a half can of tomato paste to sweeten it. I also added 6 slices of jalepano with a tablespoon of the juice.  This is really good, and stays true to its intent.  Very healthy choice.<br /><br />For those of you who don't like the salt, just take a half of a small potato. Let it simmer and that will take care of the salt."
"It is hard to describe what these bars actually are.  First I am always on the look out for a candy bar that has nuts, no chocolate and is not sickeningly sweet.  TA DA!  Enter the KIND BAR company.  These work as  candy bars.  YUMMY.  These work as a nice under 200 calorie snack to tide you over in between meals.  These definitely are nutrition bars.  Packed with good natural ingredients, these bars are great to keep in your desk or pop into your purse for any emergency hunger attacks."
"I eat mixed nuts all the time at work. They make a healthy snack instead of the donuts, etc. that are always around. The plus side of these is that they are much lower salt than usual. The down side is that they are almost all cashews. Very few brazil nuts, pecans and it is a miracle to find a macadamia nut. The lack of variety is disappointing."
"These are a tasty alternative to carb-heavy regular pretzels. I rely on Kay's Naturals to help me in my high protein diet. I would have these for breakfast every day if I could. I'm sad that I have to order them online, however. They should be available everywhere. Kids should be getting these in school vending machines, instead of the evil crap that is now available. THESE ROCK!"
I have used Harmony Valley hamburger substitute several times now and have been very happy. It is spiced and tastes pretty close to a meatball mixture. When used in sauce or to stuff peppers I cannot tell that it is not hamburger meat. I was thrilled with its performance and its ease of use.  I can't wait to try it in other recipes.
"While it may be good for sea sickness, motion sickness, and morning sickness, I have not used it for those.  (I sure would have tried it in my navy years, but that was long before I discovered them).<br /><br />But I find it very good for sore throats and congestion.  Almost as good as ginger tea.  Not bad tasting either."
All i can say is Yummy for my tummy! The whole transaction from beginning to end was a splendid experince. Thank you.
This is for puppies the bag is super small!!!The bag didn't last more than a day. I thought it was funny when I got the bag I thought it was a gift to be honest!!!
"This was their first product.  It is filtered, hence the clear color, and while doesnt have the same nutrients as their unfiltered product, for taste, it can't be beat. I would recommend to those trying to get off soft drinks and something (marginally) better."
"Flaxseed is a great way to get fiber in your diet and this brand delivers.  It has a mild taste (I put 3 tablespoons in my morning smoothie) and gives you 36% of your daily fiber required intake.  Flaxseed also contain Omega 3 so you also place a powerhouse of nutrients in your diet with this little seed.<br /><br />An excellent source of protein, fiber, and minerals such as magnesium and copper- how can you go wrong?"
"This shake is really tasty and is fairly filling too! It took me a while to figure out how to mix it - the first few times the protein would just clump up in my almond milk instead of completely dissolving. BUT this is easily fixed - just dissolve however much hempshake you will use in a little bit of water first, then add that to your milk! My favorite way to mix it is to add 3 tablespoons to just enough water to make it dissolve, then shake (it'll make a nice and thick mixture as the protein absorbs the water). Then I add enough unsweetened Almond Breeze to make it 1 cup. Makes a great breakfast that's yummy and healthy!"
"First time buyer of KA-ME Rice Crackers and I'm very impressed. These are very light, crisp and flavorful. They are as good plain as they are with cold cuts, fruit, etc. Unfortunately, the ones I purchased may be the last I get from this source. Right after I purchased the dozen packs, the price per dozen increased 44% to its present $37.99. Fortunately, I have enough to last a while, but assuming the price stays the same, these are my last KA-ME."
Morinu Soft Tofu makes the best puddings. I also make vegan mayonaise and salad dressings with it. Works out great.
Admittedly my dog loves these treats and thinks they are delicious.  However they are made in China and dog lovers in the US usually choose not to buy products from China due to prior problems with the quality control that has sickened many animals.  Dogswell should take note of this and manufacture them in the US.  It should also be noted that competitive brands on your grocery store shelves are also made in China even though distributed in California.  The only brand I have found that is manufactured in the US is from Trader Joes.  If you love your dog do not buy this item.  Go to Trader Joes.
"I think a better description of all Non-Traditional, Gummy  Products as these are needed to eliminate confusion.  These Gummy s, as the other Single Fruit Line are covered in Crystallized Sugar, and are more of a Sweet candy.  Traditional Gummbybears are aSoft in and out single source candy, the one we had as kids, these are quite sweet and hard to enjoy."
"I keep trying to find a hot chocolate I like better, but I haven't found one yet.  Traditionally, I am dark chocolate fan but this is an excellent, rich chocolate drink.  It is also my mother's favorite and she is very direct with her hints that it's time for me to send her some when her stock gets low.<br /><br />I read a review that someone thought the Bellagio brand had a chemical taste.  The reviewer might have been referring to other flavors.  There is a different taste that seems perhaps spicey, but not chemical.  I also like the fact that it contains non-dairy creamer because I do not drink milk."
"I love Shake and Bake - it's easy to prepare (shake it in a bag and toss it in the oven...DONE!), tastes great (and not overly seasoned), and clean up is easy (toss the bag...DONE!).  Like the Chicken Shake and Bake, the shaking bag is no longer included, but it's easy enough to use a Ziploc bag or put the Shake and Bake in a dish and coat your pork with it.  It bakes up quickly and keeps your pork fairly juicy.  To get the whole pork chop crispy, bake on a wire rack or crinkle your foil before putting the pork chop on top - if you place the pork chop directly on the pan, you may end up with a soggy bottom, due to the juices leaking out.  Still as ""yum yum good!"" now as it was when I was a kid!  Highly recommended!"
"I thought this would be a good gluten free replacement for Annie's mac n' cheese, but this was not really macaroni and cheese. The sauce was not smooth and was spicy (not hot-spicy, but strong-flavored spicy). My kids were appalled by it and while my husband and I could eat it, we didn't really like it. Since I bought a case, we threw away the rest of the spice packets and made our own cheese blend for the rest of the pasta. I would suggest trying one bag from a local store first if you can, otherwise be aware that you may just be buying expensive pasta with useless spice packets if your family doesn't like this unusual flavor."
Compared to other Fussie premium cat foods we tried this seems to have less in the can. We had them in 3 different occasions and cans do not have as much food so our cats feel hungry very soon.
"Diet Pepsi is the best soda available, anywhere!!!  When traveling outside the U.S. I always ask for it and if it's not available,I prefer to have plain carbonated water rather than the ""other"" cola.  My refrigerator always, and I mean always, has at least five or six bottles on the shelf and my pantry holds another 12 or so bottles.  I can only hope that it will always be manufactured."
"This quinoa has to be rinsed!  I would not have ordered it if I had known that.  There are many other brands for the same price that DON""T require this annoying and messy step."
"Our nine year old, very active, Golden Retriever loves these treats.  We cut several of them up into bite-size pieces and add them to her twice daily meals.  One order lasts us approximately two months, and the Amazon continuous shipping works great."
"Surprisingly tasty. Thin and crip. Very Cracker like and good for snacking. I got these for my husband who is on a very low sodium diet. These are great for when we travel.  It isn't easy finding prepackaged low sodium foods that taste good, but these work quite well."
"Love this sugar. It tastes so much better and isn't as overly sweet tasting as ""regular"" sugar. We've used it in quite a few baking items and they always turn out very good. The price that Amazon has this set at is very good to and makes it easy to use this for everyday stuff."
"This is a fantastic deal!! My dogs love greenies but at over $20 per bag at the local pet supply store, I couldn't afford to give them one everyday. I order these again and again."
"When I could no longer find this product at our local grocery store, I turned to Amazon.  This product arrived fresh and well-packaged.  Also, the price is comparable to the price I paid in the grocery store so home delivery really can't be beat.  Thanks!"
"I drink a lot of iced tea and this was some of the best I've had!  I will be buying it again, and again!!"
Popchips are a perfect late afternoon snack.  Gives me the energy I need for a few more hours.  I have it set up for periodic automatic shipments.
"Bought this coffee to take on vacation to use in the little 4-cup pots that are always in hotel rooms.  My husband, the coffee drinker, said it was very weak (even using two packs at one time). I threw away the rest. Save your money...buy something else."
My vet told me to have my dog get these to help with her teeth and she loves them
"I sent this to my nephew before final exams. He was thrilled to receive it and as a junk food addict, he said it had everything he needed! I would definitely recommend this basket. Great gift for a college kid!"
"My dog was on a bland diet (boiled chicken & rice) so his poop was usually solid but a few days after eating 1 Greenie a day, his poop became more liquid-y and green. Not sure if Greenies was actually the cause until I googled and read on various dog forums about how Greenies have affected other dogs. Stopped giving out my dog Greenies and have thrown them away. BEWARE, Greenies CAN be bad, so watch your dog after giving them out."
"My husband absolutely LOVES this sauce. We picked some up on our way through Gilroy, CA once and bought 6 on our next trip through! It adds great flavor to Tacos, Eggs, Potatoes, Breakfast Burrito's, and lots more!"
"OK so I bought the Sam's Club Fruit Snacks thinking I could save some money.  Come on they are 5 and 2 they'll eat anything with sugar, right?  WRONG.  They LOVE the Scooby-Doo fruit snacks.  Now I just have to find poor kids that can eat the Sam's Club Fruit Snacks."
"Popchips are tasty and healthy. I enjoy a bag everyday for my afternoon snack, they are satisfying and don't make you feel weighed down."
"Excellent<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M5W7YQ"">Emerils Gourmet Coffee, Emeril's Big Easy Bold, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> coffee if your tastes are toward a stronger coffee. The pack of 50 come in a cardboard box. I like the 24 box package since they fit in my lazy Susan cabinet turn-around and take them out and feed the stainless K Cup holder on the counter. I think its more habit then anything else. As for the coffee.... try it!"
"They package their product in plastic containers while boiling hot. Does ""organic"" make sense after that?"
Very Natural flavor. Not loaded with sugars and other things not good for you. Has a fresh taste of orange/tangerine and the carbonation is great. Great taste. I enjoyed this product and would recommend.
Everything that is stated in the information is exactly what I had recieved.  thank you
"The ""rope"" idea doesn't really work ( well it works 1 time). It actually impedes the dispensing of the treats after your dog yanks it out - now the treats are stuck inside until the human pushes the rope back in.<br /><br />Would NOT purchase again!"
"I really enjoy this product. I had such a hard time finding it affordable in the store. Once I found it I look no further, it's the only sugar I use.  Thanks so much."
the grand children love them.  It's a great way to keep them entertained and behaved cuz they know they will get a treat from grandma.
more than we expected the flavor is great just the right amount of spicy and heat together and a fantastic price too! very easy to open. will buy again and again and again. you won't be sorry buying these.
U-No candy bars are my very favorite!  They were only distributed in Calif. so they haven't become widely known but are popular with CA candy lovers.  I started eating them when I was a young child and still find them as delightful as I remembered. Try it.  You'll like it!
"Always glad to see this water delivered to our doorstep. Not a drop of it spilled during delivery yet, due to  nice quality of  bottles.<br />Even though the delivery box itself has arrived bashed in, with the tape flopping, - must say the shrink wrapping has held, and the bottles themselves haven't spilled a drop of the water.<br />  We're on our third case of  it right now, and very happy with this purchase.  The water tastes good and the bottles hold their shape.<br /><br /> About weight  of these bottles commented upon in another review... I thought the comment was interesting and it reminded me that yes, I do drive a few bottles to work in the car, I don't backpack them.  Not a really obvious difference in weight, though, I think. Maybe necessary for shipping?<br /><br />  Guess it's like choosing sleeping bags...if you are using a vehicle, you can  use a heavier sleeping bag, so they tell me.<br /> Anyway, I think you'll like this water, and you get 30 bottles per case, instead of the usual 24.<br />We plan to order more.  We're glad we can do this."
"This is a nice freezer tray. The base is so supple; it's really easy to pop the food out. The size is a little large for what I need at the moment. My baby is 6 months old and only eats the ice-cube size portions right now, but I can see that the larger size of this Beaba tray will come in handy as my baby grows."
"Great change from artificially flavored soda, but it was almost sweet enough to be a concentrate. We mixed it up 50/50 with club soda and it was perfect!"
"So the version of the toy I got had a rope and not the rubber 'rope'.  It's a bit misleading because there are pictures of both versions.  I had seen the toys in the store and had only seen the rubber ropes so figured that was the current version...I figured wrong...and within 10 minutes my dog had untied and completely frayed the rope, thus ending the whole point of the toy.  They have a 'helpful hint' of what to do when the dog has destroyed the rope of putting different sized balls in the toy to get a 'similar' effect...that's great, but it's not the toy I bought.  AND now, I have to go out and buy the balls to put in it so I don't completely waste my money on what became a useless toy in 10 minutes.  It's a good idea but I wouldn't recommend this toy...they need to work out some kinks first and/or up the quality of this product."
Lower in calories and great taste.  I like them just as much as the regular greasy chips.  It's nice to have a great tasting healthy alternative.
Have been buying Bustelo for years and was happy to see this Supreme which I was not acquainted with.  I strongly recommend it - delicious coffee all the time.
"As a child Maple brown sugar Quaker Instant Oatmeal was my favorite flavor. In fact it was the only flavor I would eat. So after many years of not eating it I tried it again. I was shocked to discover that it doesn't taste anything like it did when I was a kid. And turns out I am not the only person that noticed this. My girlfriend noticed rigjt away after one bite. So if you are new to this oatmeal, give it a sjot but if you are like me and want to relive childhood memories.....don't!"
"Almost gagged at first taste. I have used other coconut based products (water, milk, cooking oil, etc) and this is the first time I have been disappointed. My teenage kids hated it. My son is health food nut and drinks all the protein shakes and he couldn't stand it. I am sure Done is not the healthiest, but one you try that, there is no comparison in flavor tolerance."
"Be careful that you know what you are getting.  i have a bichon frise, and a 12"" bull stick is a bit long for her to handle.  the written description says each bull stick is 6"", which is what i wanted.  the package shows more than one, whereas i received one 12"" stick for that price.  much too long for a smaller dog."
"I was hoping for actual juice. A kiwi and strawberry combination is one of those combinations that I usually love. In fact if you combine strawberry with anything I'm usually game (steak, chocolate, banana, etc.) and this COULD be a good drink. However, it's in the fizzy drink school of beverages and as a fizzy drink, I can't stand it.<br /><br />Granted, I was never too fond of the fizzy drinks in the first place. The orange drinks were always a bad second to actual orange juice. Not that I don't love pop, but I really can't get behind a bad orange juice pop.<br /><br />So at first taste, this is rather sweet. But then it goes down and its too sweet. And fizzy. The fizzy and the sweet combine and you are drinking candy. Not that pop is anything but candy, but there's candy and there's candy and this is the hard candy that your grandmother gives you to suck on to shut you up for a few hours.<br /><br />Not very good."
"I bought this to keep my Japanese Spitz occupied, no good. I don't know if it's too difficult for her or if she's just not interested in working that hard for food. She's good for a few minutes then gives up even though she'll get food from it."
"We love Happy Baby products - cereals, puffs, yogurt melts, all the baby food - EXCEPT Gobble Gobble. Even my 3 year old choked on this. It really ticked me off when my 1 year old choked too! It is EXTREMELY dry and thick and lumpy. I cannot believe Happy Baby manufacturers and sells this stuff, and I can't believe retailers stock it. DO NOT BUY!"
"I've had to hunt far and wide to find the right K-cups for me.  Generally, I like coffee people donut shop, and that had been my go to coffee for a while.  The dark bold coffees are way too intense for me, but the mediums are generally way too weak.  Wanting to try something new, I followed the reviews and tried this coffee thinking it would be a good strong but-not-too-strong alternative.<br /><br />It wasn't.  If I use two pods, this is a decent, but weaker, coffee for me to use in my travel cup for the ride into work.  Otherwise, it is much too weak.  I was very surprised that the first time I brewed some and poured in half and half, the coffee turned very light brown.  It was almost white.  I will get through this package, but I will not buy again.  It's not cost effective for me to use two pods to be satisfied.  Any other suggestions?"
"When I opened this package and sniffed (like I do all coffee), I just prepared myself for the worst in terms of taste. It smelled bitter and almost sour and sure enough that's exactly how it tasted as well. I am used to strong coffee but this is was just a travesty. In order to not waste it, I added some cappuccino and milk to it and managed to get it down but even through that, the sourness was still evident to some extent."
"I hate to type this, because there are so many people that really enjoy this product, but take a look at the ingredients in this so-called ""all-natural"" product. I have the cheddar cheese flavor right in front of me, so that is the only flavor I can vouch for right now.  About halfway down the list of ingredients you'll see ""yeast extract."" Unfortunately, this is the new MSG.  Many people are still unaware of this fact and ""natural"" food companies are taking advantage.  It is a chemical flavor enhancer whose potential side effects are very scary.  Google ""MSG yeast extract"" for yourself, or check out [...]."
"Received product, which I purchased from Amazon.  Not a single cookie survived transit.  Nothing but crumbs.  Simply not worth getting from Amazon unless they do a better shipping job.  I would stay away from anything that is fragile at least in the sense of foods and groceries."
Bought a sample pack today of the Jamaica Me Crazy and love the flavor.  The flavor is not too powerful nor was it  overwhelming.  I'd recommend the Wolf Gang Puck k-cups.
Raving reviews made me buy this for dogs.<br />I have a lab mix a beagle and 2 Shepards that I got from impoundment and they're not spoiled.<br />One chewed it to crumbles but left it on the ground and my Shepards have been burying them in the backyard.<br />I wasted my money on this one.
Every year for Christmas I have given my boyfriend different gourmet brands of hot chocolate as stocking stuffers. However three years ago I got Bellagio hot chocolate and that is the ONLY brand he wants. He especially loves the caramel praline and the chocolate truffle. They are smooth and wonderful in warm/hot milk! It's never an over whelming or under whelming flavor. Always delicious. Whether you are sipping it reading a book or having it with friends after a great meal. I highly recommend it!!!
"DisposaKups - Disposable K-Cups for Keurig Brewers - 50 Cups, Lids, Filters - 100% Disposable are handy because you buy your own coffee that you like and just fill K-cups and then throw them out.  I pre-fill them so all I have to do is put them in the machine."
I saw them advertised in the Weight Watcher magazine and gave them a try. I love them. Tasty and crunchy. I've ordered more.
"love this coffee, its a bit light but but very good taste. Works amazing with the kurig machine, easy to use, clean, and fast. I only use kurig machine now and love all the different coffee options.."
All my horses love a sweet reward. Dots hold together nicely in the reward bag.
"This sounded so tasty from the reviews and the flavors were enticing...so I ordered some.  We had some for breakfast today and then went to pack the other boxes in bags to go to the homeless shelter.  To us, it is dreadful.  It has the texture of paste and not even palatable...for us.  Am throwing out the box we opened and canceling my order on subscribe and save.  When you consider how easy it is to make real oatmeal, I'm sorry I was fooled by these flavors."
"Compared to pho I've had at restaurants, Annie Chun's doesn't hold up. I'm not even going to bother. But compared to other instant noodle soups, Annie Chun's is light years ahead.<br /><br />The noodles are soft and moist in the package - not fried and dried. The sauce is liquid and just oily enough. And there is a healthy packet of dehydrated veggies. The instructions do involve giving the noodles a soak and then draining. This can be a hassle where the best you can manage at work is to heat a mug of water in the microwave. I'm going to have to drain the noodles in the bathroom. Yech... But the extra step will be worth it. And unlike other instant cups of soup, I actually feel satiated after eating - not just buzzed from the sodium!<br /><br />I'll definitely be getting more of these!"
"These are not black winter truffles (Tuber melanosporum).  I thought the price was too good to be true, (even though they aren't fresh), and it is.  These are Tuber indicums.  It says so right on the label.<br /><br />I was very angry about this, but JR Mushrooms has said they will refund me for the truffles and even let me keep them.  So I give JR credit for excellent  responsiveness and customer service, although I still feel they should not be labeled ""black winter truffles""."
"I have found that using this product in basically everthing requirng a sweetner to be very easy to use, mixes in so easy, does not crytalize as raw honey can, and does not give me a ""sugar rush"" feeling. Amazon has the best price I have found and does an excellent job shipping this sweetener with out any damaged bottles. This is the only place I go to purchase this product now. The background information on this product is very interesting, look it up sometime. It is great with Newman's Organic Green Tea!!! Also, this is where I purchace that tea, from Amazon."
My cat has kidney problems and has to take three pills twice a day.  It was undoable and gag-inducing until Pill Pockets.  Now he begs for them.  Astounding and miraculous!  Thank you for making these!
"I would recommend not buying these nuts if you are looking for some really good tasting nuts.  These are just average quality, and the brazil nuts taste just plain awful.  The only good tasting nut in this lot is the almond and pecans.  There are barely any pecans, but tons of cashews.  Try another brand as I am sure there is something better out there."
One of my kitties is a complete snob when it comes to food and she loves this. Great product to buy.
"This is a great treat and my Maltese loves them! I love them because of the organic ingredients, no artificial coloring or flavors, and it's low cal, which means I can offer her an extra treat now and then. However, I do think they could have come up with a better name for the product other than ""Get Naked"". I was reluctant to do a search for it assuming I'd end up on a porno site."
"Since discovering Yogi Teas a few years ago, I have enjoyed the rich aroma and tastes of their varied flavors as well as the fact that they are de-caf. I love Peach Tea in general and this is definitely my favorite peach flavor out of all the other herbal tea companies. The Yogi Vanilla Almond is also in my basket of tea to drink everyday."
"I felt really good about being a good cat mommy and buying something of such quality for my sweeties... Too bad none of the would eat it, no matter what I did.<br /><br />Donated it to the local SPCA -- maybe a dog will eat it."
"I have an otherwise healthy and active 1 year old Rottweiler.  I switched her from Blue Buffalo to Canidae, as it came highly recommended by the holistic pet store I frequent (they are going to be the next to get an earful from me!!!).<br /><br />Shortly after, I noticed her stool became loose, which is common when you change a dog's diet (I mixed the new food with the old for a week, gradually increasing the amount of the new).  I figured it would get better after a few days.  In fact, it became increasingly worse to the point where spots of blood where showing up in her stool.<br /><br />I took her to the vet thinking at this point she must have picked up a parasite.  The test came back negative.  My vet thought it must have been something she ate and recommended I feed her chicken and rice for a week to even her out.  I did this and the problem was solved.<br /><br />After a week I put her back on her regular food- Canidae- and the problem she was having before began to return, albeit gradually.  We have now started to see spots of blood again.  This convinced me it was not just ""something she picked up,"" but the dog food itself.<br /><br />Now I have learned there is actually a CLASS ACTION SUIT against this dog food maker for the exact problem I described- in some cases people's dogs even died.  I will NEVER purchase this brand again and am switching my dog immediately back to Blue Buffalo- this time no mixing!!"
"I'm shocked that anyone gave this product a good review.  I've used Arm & Hammer Multicat strength for years but my husband bought a box of this... I couldn't even use the whole box I hate it that much!  If you don't mind everything within 10 feet of your litter box being covered in a huge cloud of dust, including  yourself when you clean the box, then you should definitely buy this product.  AWFUL!!!"
"The flavor of these pods is horrid.  I ordered them only because Senseo was out of stock for so long, and I needed some decaf pods, and these had received a couple good reviews (which I now suspect were written by Baronet employees).  I have never tasted such awful coffee before. A big ""YUK"" for Baronet."
"I purchased these because they do not contain dairy, soy or corn.  Well, in addition to being dairy free, soy free.... they are FLAVOR FREE!  Absolutely horrible dry tasting bars.  First words out of my mouth were ""tastes like dirt"" so that's what I'm going with.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."
"The beef, chicken, and turkey and gravy foods are disgusting. They are so disgusting, I didn't have the heart to feed this to my child. When I popped the lid to these the first thing I noticed was the foul smell. It made me gag. I can't even describe how bad this smelled. It was like rotten meat flavored jello. I didn't have the heart to make my daughters eat it so I gave it to my cats. None of them would go near it except for one who ate about 1/4 of it and walked away. Don't torture your child with this."
"We fed this to our bulldog when she was a puppy, and at first she did wonderful. Then the corn and preservatives took their toll.... She was itching and had a chronic ear infection and her face had a terrible yeasty smell ALL the time. She licked her paws constantly and scratched her face raw on any surface she could find. Then she started vomiting. We HAD to change her food. Now she eats a fully carnivorous raw diet and is thriving! No more itching, no more ear infections, no more yeast, no more paw licking."
"This syrup is so good. I do not usually like maple syrup but this one is delicious. It does not have an overly strong maple flavor but is very sweet. I will puchase again based on flavor,its organic,great price, made in USA/Vermont. Maple Syrup just does not get any better than this. They do need to use stonger shipping boxes and wipe the jugs. I had sugar ants in my box but not in my syrup."
"If you like Orange Crush you may become a fan, but it's too much of a hybrid for me. The main two ingredients are reconstituted apple and grape juices. It contains something called Acerola juice, which is high in Vitamin C (and indeed the can contains 100% of your C and 20% of your A).<br /><br />The sugar content is high---34 grams---which brings the carb percentage up to 12% for the day and the calorie count to 140. I think it tastes too acidic for anyone who is watching carbs and calories to be willing to ""spend"" them on Switch, which almost tastes like carbonated TANG.  I've tried the Ooba drinks, and they are much lighter and more refreshing. Guess I'm just not ready to make the Switch!"
"I use this as iced tea and have been using large amounts of this product for some time.  It is $3.39/box localy.  I use a box every 4 days.  It adds up to allot of money.  Buying this on subscription, I am paying about $2.50/box (no shipping fee for Prime members).  That is a substantial difference in price.<br />Next....  This is a delightful iced tea.  To make 1 gallon I steep 10 bags in a about 2 cups water, and then steep them a second time.  Wring them out and add all to pitcher.  I then add 40 tabs equal and 2 individual packets lemonade (the kind intended for bottled water) and get a wonderful beverage that everyone loves.  Enjoy!!!!"
We love Kettle Chips Lightly Salted and don't feel guilty eating them!  We used to buy them at Whole Foods but buying from Amazon has saved us money.  We have purchased at least 3 times and have been happy with the chips and the delivery.
"I have bought these for a long time and felt better about the product because I believed them to be of American origin.  I purchased several bags (strips, wrapped apples, etc) and now realize the country of origin is CHINA.  With all the FDA regulations about packaging, it's about time it was mandated that country of origin be prominently displayed (like in 20 font type - not microscopic writing no one notices!!!) ON THE FRONT OF THE PACKAGE!!!  As a result, I will no longer purchase Dogswell products.  As an aside, rawhide is an even worse offender, since the dog can get a much higher dose of any toxins used in curing the hide (and you can bet there are plenty!).  I even picked up a package of a brand named (something like) ""U.S.A. Rawhide"" and on the back, in fine print, was ""Made in China.""  Why aren't our legislators doing something productive and cracking down on this?  It's sneaky at best and intentionally deceptive at worst!  Amazon, please find us products for our ""furry kids"" that won't make them sick or kill them!"
"BEWARE! This is not the ""flavor"" displayed on the label of the pictured can of cat food in the photo.  This is a photo of the original formula's label.  I ordered 5 cases because the label indeed showed a photo of the label on the ""Classic Chicken ENTREE with Brown Rice""..this was the ORIGINAL formula.  Friskies phased out the original formula and REPLACED it with ""Classic Chicken PATE with Brown Rice"" (PATE IS ON THE LABEL OF THE NEW FORMULA).<br />My cat LOVED the ORIGINAL formula.  Friskies ""replacement"" formula is different (texture is nearly the same, so it has to be in the ingredients) MY CAT DOES NOT LIKE THE NEW FORMULA.  I believe this is an outrage.  Displaying one picture and then sending an entirely different labeled can?  I am disappointed in Amazon.  NOW, imagine the shipping expense to return 5 cases of canned cat food???? I had to separate the cases from the huge box in order to even lift them into the house!......$73+ down the drain.  To add insult to injury...I can get this replacement ""PATE formula"" at my local Petco store (on sale) for the SAME PRICE per case.  So much for trusting the photos of products displayed for sale on Amazon."
"This is EXTREMELY better than Wilton!!!  Buy this and never use that nasty stuff again.  This is actually edible, unlike products and is very easy to work with."
I read the reviews on this and thought id get some for my dog and pup.<br />They will not touch it. Even if I mix it with home cooked food.<br /><br />They like the dollar store dog food better than this.<br /><br />Amazon let me down on even allowing this dog food to be sold under their name.
"These pretzels have a nice crunch and a lot of nutritional value, but their flavor is very bland.  Bland with a hint of cinnamon.  I wish I'd tried a single bag before buying an entire 12-bag box, but they're not available in stores (at least where I live) and the reviews seemed fairly positive.  On the bright side, they do leave you feeling comfortably full for minimal calories.  A recommended diet food for those who have the fortitude to place higher priority on protein-dense snacking rather than flavor."
"I transplanted a ficus to a larger pot (no gnats previously), and soon after our bathroom was infested with gnats.  I like the response I get from my plants outdoors with MiracleGro's potting mix, but I will never use this again for indoor plants."
"Baconnaise is so good - it really tastes like bacon, just creamier. I would highly recommend this product."
"Once in a while you just want a spicy different flavor. Sometimes when I have a lightly seasoned or plain piece of beef or chicken, I put some Sweet Chili Sauce on my rice. Wow that perks up the whole plate. Other times I cook the meat without seasoning and add what every flavor I'm in the mood for when I reheat it. I've kept open bottles in my refrigerator for months without any problem.<br /><br />If you have never tried this, the sauce is thicker than Heinz Ketchup so you can slowly add sweetness and heat until its just right for you. Another way to use this is on steamed vegetables and you can add peanuts or sliced almonds just before serving."
Tried this in a turkey burger and it was sooo good. I definitely recommend faery free. Salt can be added or better yet add a sprinkle of Goya Adobo.
"I didn't mind paying the $20+ a bag because my dog loved them. These are so expensive that I didn't look on the bag to see where they were made until ANOTHER recent recall on Chinese dog treats/food that was killing dogs....when I looked at the Happy Hips bag, I was pretty ticked off to see that these are made in China.<br /><br />I used to joke that my dog was addicted to these, but now I am actually a little concerned that there may be some addictive substance in these Chinese ""treats"""
I have enjoy every bite!!!!<br />I would and will order more in the future!<br />Such a great gift!!<br />It was so fresh when it arrived!!
"My oldest cat has become very finicky about his food, and I need him to gain some weight, so I decided to try a new food.  Fussie Cat gave him diarrhea, which I attributed to switching to a new food, but it lasted for the three weeks I fed it to him, and his fur became duller.  Every time my other two cats got into this food, they vomited, which they generally do not do.  My oldest cat just got a checkup.  He now has renal failure.  His numbers were 100% fine just a few months ago.  I can only attribute it to this food.  I believe he has acute renal failure due to some toxin from Fussie Cat.  Fussie Cat is from Thailand-- there are ZERO regulations for pet food there, and can write whatever they feel like on the can.  My vet, when he saw the food, told me to get my cat off of it, and said other clients of his had had bad reactions to this food.<br /><br />If you value your pet's health, stay far, far away from Fussie Cat.  I have my cat on Merrick now, and he is doing better.  I can only hope I can reverse the damage this food has done."
"I've been a fan of Blue Diamond's almond milk for a while now, and have tried their coconut milk, but when I first tasted this stuff, I was blown away. It has a flavor that is *much* better than either almond or coconut milk individually, and has a light, smooth, even texture that feels like you're drinking liquid silk. Pure ambrosia!"
This food is great!  My triplets love it.  I thought it tasted great too!  If I need to go on puree food I want this.
"I enjoy coffee, but frequently have to limit consumption due to acid reflux and other issues, that can be exasperated by coffee, particularly on an empty stomach.<br /><br />To test this product, I waited for a Saturday morning, brewed the coffee normally and chose not to eat, while then following up with some outdoor activity.<br /><br />In instances where I previously would have suffered acid burning in my throat, I felt none of that, after drinking two cups of coffee.<br /><br />The taste is not the strongest French roast I have ever had, but the trade off, particularly for someone who has to speak a lot in the morning, and hence avoid coffee when I speak, is well worth it."
"I just recently got a Keurig machine and I have tried out many different coffees. I have tried different brands and different flavors, and this one has by far been one of my favorites. I don't always like flavored coffees because I often find them to be overpowering in their smell or taste....but this one is just right. It smells great and the flavor is smooth and tasty. I was expecting not to like it before I tried it because I am not usually a fan of flavored coffees, but I was so pleasantly surprised with this one. I love it! I went through the first box very fast because I couldn't stop drinking it, so I had to buy more. It is one of my new favorite coffees and I am so glad to have found it!"
This was a very hard to find item and was very pleased with the service I received
"UPDATED REVIEW (10/7/2012):  I am disappointed to see that Merrick increased the price of this food 50%!  The 8-pound bag used to be $8.69, but is now $16.00 and some change.  Whole Earth Farms is supposed to be an affordable way for responsible pet owners to feed their pets Merrick quality, but it seems Merrick has decided to up the ante based on this food's popularity.  I'm very disappointed by the decision and may have to switch back to my previous brand.<br /><br />ORIGINAL REVIEW:  After deciding to switch from Nutro Max to Merrick Whole Earth Farms Adult Dry Dog Food, my dog literally does circles when it's time to eat.  The food is loaded with good stuff for my dog and it even smells better than our previous brand.  It obviously tastes better, too, because my dog just can't contain himself when it's time to eat.  His coat is shinier and seems really healthy, and on a semi-gross note, but important one, his stools have been much smaller; that tells me his body is absorbing more of the nutrition in this food than the last one.  I actually ended up reducing his food portion because he was gaining a little weight.  That's always a sign of a good dog food...the ability to feed less and the dog still receive great nutrition; that tells me there are much fewer fillers in this food than most.  I recommend you try it."
"My baby loves this salmon combination a lot more than the popular chick chick (which is actually her least favorite). Yes, it does stink... its fish! I don't care for fish myself, smell or taste, but she digs this and its good for her. This brand has a much lower sodium content than plum and sprout and is cheaper on a different website. I make most all of her other foods but am not quite ready to tackle preparing meat so Happy Baby has been great for introducing chicken, fish, beef, and turkey."
"Having lived in Europe for over 30 years, it was indeed a pleasure to savor a more classical, European style gourmet coffee. This was the first time that I had tried the Melitta brand and I was very pleased with the aroma during brewing, which did remind me of cafes back in Britain and France. You need to make a fairly generous brew to get the full-bodied impact from this blend and it goes very well with cream and also a dab of honey. The taste is quite rich and the aroma during brewing is very much like freshly ground coffee beans.<br /><br />I am sure that I will be back for more as it makes for a delightful brew that is great to wake up to on a Sunday morning, or any morning for that matter."
"I admit I bought a box of these at an Organic Sensitive Aware Health food grocery store, so I expected it to be expensive. However, this one deserves to be an entry in Consumer Reports' last page, which unfortunately I can't remember the name of at the moment.  Each month, the last page of CR's magazine has pictures people send in of scandalously absurd ripoffs, ad goofs, typos, etc, such as a picture of a six-inch tall pill bottle with the 1/2 cubic inch of actual pills that came in it --i.e. making the packaging look real big so the sucker customer will not realize the contents are so paltry.  Enjoy Life's marketing department did its job well; the box is 5 1/4""H x 6 1/2""W x 1 1/2"" D: the actual food item, once you unwrap the (5 1/2"" inch long) foil packet is just under 3"" long, less than 1/2"" wide, & 3/8"" deep.  I was driving when I ripped open the packet, & almost drove off the road when I beheld the veritable rat-poo dimensions of the bar.  Yes, it is sold by weight (5 oz; the things are dense), but the packaging is ridiculously misleading.<br /><br />Oh, the taste.  It's okay; vaguely sunflower seed-ish, merely the barest rumor of a whisper of sweetness or salt; as with most GF food manufacturers, Enjoy Life seems to feel that those of us who must forego gluten, or dairy or nuts or whatever also have no interest in flavor.  It does have a nice chewy mouth feel to it, which would have been nicer had there been more to feel.<br /><br />In a (presumably) unconscious self-satire, in big letters on the back of the box, it says ""Still Hungry?""  Well yes, and I know several people who would answer same if they ate the entire box of bar-lets, particularly if they'd been expecting something appropriate to the size of the box."
"I ordered 15 boxes of this flour, or at least that's what I thought!  The carton in which the flour was delivered sat unopened until recently (September 5, 2012) and lo and behold - only 11 boxes!  I would advise caution if buying from this vendor!!!  The flour itself is great (or I should say was, because General Mills for some reason stopped making it, at least as packaged in 2# boxes)."
"Very odd product.  Can says No GM ingredients (Genetically Modified?) but the ingredients include partially hydrogenated canola and palm oils.  Yucky source of transfats so be aware that thsi imported product contains 2g trans fat per serving...and each can has 3.5 servings.<br /><br />Taste wise - in my opinion, tastes like soggy, wet fruitcake (not in any good way at all).  WAY TOO SWEET and I even got a few bites with a sandy, gritty, crunch texture which was horrible and I can only hope it was from the raisins?!<br /><br />This product is not pleasant tasting at all so I am just not sure about all the other great reviews.  But for my taste, I couldn't choke down even a few bites of this stuff.  Only thing I appreciated from this was the few laughs from friends/family over the name of this Heinz product."
"This machine I took sometime, waiting, studying, and I finally purchased it! I am blown away at the taste. It makes perfect cups of coffee over and over again. I have tried several Kcups, and you can find the one thats right for you with so many options on the market. I will say this: When you first buy it, it will smell funny after you turn it on. The heating element takes a little time and gives off that smell. The book states to run one cup water through before using. I did it several times throught a couple hr period, and the smell went away. I wouldnt brew until the smell was gone, after my friend said hers tasted funny in the first few cups. I did not!"
"Anyone who doesn't like this product is probably a fat slob. This is an amazing substitute for the extremely fat and calorie dense original. After trying this, I don't think I'll ever eat traditional peanut butter ever again!"
"I ordered the Little Bambino popcorn popper along with a 24ct. box of this popcorn.  All the items arrived right before Christmas (love Amazon Prime!) as promised.  The popcorn popper itself was a breeze to set up.  I got this for my girlfriend as she LOVES popcorn.  The reason for the low review?  The popcorn is HORRIBLE!  It was tough and chewy.  We ended up with just as many kernels as we did with popped popcorn.  I tried to excuse this since it was the first time using the machine, but 4 bags later and the popcorn is still just as tough and chewy as the first batch.  And did I mention that the popcorn was way too salty but that was more than like the result of so much of it not popping.<br /><br />Once you hear the popcorn popper stop popping popcorn, your supposed to turn off the popper as it will burn what's left in the popper because it's all jammed with popcorn. The oil has to go in first so the popcorn doesn't get burned when you drop it in the popper.  I tried to alter the steps in different ways hoping the popcorn would come out better but it just didn't work out for us.<br /><br />Gonna give good 'ol Mr. Redenbacher a shot next.  Now I just need to figure out how to cancel my 'popcorn subscription'."
"Thanks for the egg tip, it works very well and really helps this product.  Nevertheless, I ended up giving away three of the six containers because I was not thrilled with the nutritional information."
"These Emerils Gourmet Coffee, Emeril's Big Easy Bold, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50) are defective!!! Almost half of them blew the tops off in brewing and filled the coffee mug with coffee grounds, and had to throw away. WILL NOT BY AGAIN!!!"
"Came packaged accordingly, and very, very, very, very delicious!  This is a good product and it was packaged properly!  A+"
"I have a very hectic lifestyle and need time to relax. I have always had trouble sleeping as my head is spinning. I have tried lots of methods to try and sleep well but nothing has worked. I saw this product in my local walmart and thought, what the heck, I'll try it.<br /><br />Wow, Why could they not have brought this product out years ago. After about 20 minutes my mind was able to let go and relax and I had the best nights sleep in a long time. The taste is awesome and it does not feel overwhelming like other products.<br /><br />I am ordering more to stock up my fridge, Just Great!!"
"I used these rainbow jimmies for a rainbow cupcake topper and added them to rice krispie treats for my daughter's 6th birthday.  Obviously, it was a rainbow party.  The package didn't look like the picture, but I was not disappointed in the product.  I would buy from this company again."
"My dog LOVES this toy but the rope seems too big for the opening, making it virtually impossible to get out any treats.<br /><br />I contacted the manufacturer regarding this issue and was sent a new rope, just to make sure the bottle I had wasn't mismatched with the rope size.  The replacement ended up being the same diameter, so I gave up on the rope altogether.  The way I adjust the difficulty of the ""game"" is by varying the size of the treats inserted.<br /><br />My dog doesn't eat kibble so I put in all natural treats, nuts, dehydrated salmon, etc. I sometimes throw in a whole walnut just to make the game harder.  He LOVES the toy and rolls it all over my apartment in an attempt to get everything out.<br /><br />When only the large, impossible-to-get pieces are left, my dog brings it to me out of frustration, and I reward him by opening the bottom and giving him the last pieces.<br /><br />One aspect of this toy that I really like is the fact that you can disassemble and wash it.  Some other toys say they're dishwasher safe but can't be opened, so I can't imagine the cleaning being very thorough.  Also, the ""mouth"" is made of soft rubber that [I would think] massages the dogs' gums and cleans their teeth a little.<br /><br />Overall this is a great, challenging, tiring game that rewards dogs for their effort and determination.  My only wish is that the rope were a bit thinner, which would make the game ""reasonably"" challenging rather than almost impossible.  This is the only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this toy, even if you use it without the rope."
What a great deal. I live in an area where you can almost NEVER get what you want in the size you want...when you want. So when there is a good deal..I get it. Then I discovered Amazon grocery. OMG!! I love it! CASES 'o food at amazing prices!! Anyway...this peanut oil is wonderful. Great size bottle for every day use. Excellent!
"With the Amazon Mom discount, this is cheaper than in stores unless there's a sale.  It regularly goes on sale at Kroger, Publix, and other grocery stores for around 50 cents a jar.  I wish there were other Earth's Best fruit varieties available on Amazon at this price.  No problems with breakage during shipping for me, but I found the packaging annoying.  In general though, I think Earth's Best is a good brand and that the price is fair for what you're getting:  organic, non-GMO baby food delivered to your door step!  As a single mom in a rural community, going to the grocery store with the baby can be such a hassle.<br /><br />Earth's Best is definitely better tasting and smelling than non-organic foods like Gerber.  The textures are good, but I had to stay on 1st foods longer than six months because the textures of almost all 2nd Foods made my son gag.  I had a similar issue graduating from 2nd Foods to 3rd Foods.  Sprout baby food, however, is the best quality I've tried for freshness, aroma, and taste.  It reminds me of pureed fresh produce.  While I've seen it in Winn-Dixie for the same price as Earth's Best, it's much more expensive on Amazon and the selection of flavors is relatively limited both in stores and online.  I'm going to start making my own organic baby food and freezing it, but I'll probably always keep a few jars of Earth's Best to get by in a pinch."
I bought the kit to dabble in spherification. The item is as-described and arrived on time. My complaint is that the instructions measure the required chemicals in fractions of grams. My kitchen scale measures as low as 1 gram but does not do fractions of grams. I cannot find a kitchen scale that measures fractions of grams. Therefore I find the kit difficult to use. I would not recommend the kit because it requires the purchase of specialized scale that can measure tenths of grams.
"The flavor and quality cannot compare to Zevia Ginger Ale made with erythritol and stevia but not into a mega commercial commodity. I don't know all of what they must do to ""process"" Truvia into what it is since they don't have to disclose the process or the additives, but no comparison to just good erythritol and stevia. Wouldn't have thought it would make such a difference. We will never buy any of these sodas again. All of the Zevia sodas are good (although more expensive, they are worth it) and don't make everyone have serious intestinal pain."
"I switched to Merrick dog food several years ago (2007) when all the dog food seemed to be tainted with the rat poison - specificlly Aminopterin - and was getting worse by the day.<br /><br />My dog is my life and I would have been devastated to know I had fed her something that would have caused the suffering and anguished death and illness that many of these pets had been forced to endure. So, I started to look around and found it appalling that there was such little oversight in pet food manufacture and control regarding ingredients and labelling. I knew that it was NOT natural for dogs who had been carnivores for thousands of years to be eating all this processed ""scrap"" and bonemeal - no matter how the companies tried to ""re-label"" it. I also though, knew how critical it was for animals to get critical micro-nutrients in appropriately balanced levels and it could be equally devastating for someone uneducated in animal nutrition to think that they could just 'home-cook' meals which could leave gaping holes in these essential minerals, vitamins and micro-nutrients; not to mention the ratios of fats, oils, proteins that the animals need. So, I was searching for a company I could TRUST!<br /><br />I found Merrick and have not turned back! We have never been happier and use both Grammy Pot Pie Kibble as well as some of these canned dog food cans - though since 'we' are a small dog we use the ""smaller"" sized cans (cat food sized 5.5oz) The cans are ironically enough - filled with ingredients that you can read and UNDERSTAND. You can also go to their website and find out what any ingredient that may sound 'foreign' really is and why they used it - I found out they were almost always a natural ingredient that is an alternative to a processed chemical. I also found it comforting that particularly with the canned food I could open it and RECOGNIZE ingredients like a potato looking like a suprise, POTATO! Or a pea, carrot, etc. My dog LOVES this merrick food and has never been healthier! Our vet constantly comments on her blood work levels coming back at ""perfect levels"" and she is almost 9. Her coat is really healthy and probably what is noticed by most pet owners and yet not the most 'pleasant' aspect to discuss, is that she has almost NO gas (I don't give her much if any people food either) but when she is given other brands she can be really hard to sit near on ocassion :) . I think the phrase you get out what you put in applies here as well... I will not switch from Merrick food - ever! My only regret is that I did not start feeding my little four-legged one Merrick sooner!"
"I just love these - have tried several flavors ..  gives a gluten freer a chance to snack on a crunchy, healthy snack!!"
"Any coffee lover should enjoy a cup of this good tasting coffee. I fixed it nice and strong the way I prefer mine, and it was excellent to the very last drop. No heartburn afterward which is a testament to the low acid claim. Now, if they'll just let us know where and how to purchase it ..."
"As another reviewer stated, many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder- from alive and aware, ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder. That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME! I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product, from SAQUIN??, which is NOT what I ordered, and it is more expensive- the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping, not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase.  I know it was still from alive and aware mid-february, but recently something changed.<br />I am really confused/irritated how my review for ""alive and aware raw cacao"" got switched to a different brand from a different seller?!?! i mean, can't they just say ""out of stock"" or ""currently unavailable"" like they do with other stuff. why would they switch reviews around?<br />Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one, especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware. also the price increase is pretty shocking! i guess it is the market, and raw cacao is in higher demand. Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao.<br />I did recently order alive and aware's raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those. they are as the description states, from alive and aware, not another brand.<br />Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the ""brands"" and ""vendors"" that ship from Amazon. I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country, but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company. seems like halal everyday, alive and aware, etc, are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin. are these really different companies, under the auspices of amazon, or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said, he ordered something that said ""alive and aware"" in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday.  who knows. i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon.<br /><br />For now, i am going to seek out another source, not through amazon, that stands behind their cacao. it is very important to me, for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested, to know that i am getting top-notch, certified organic, raw cacao. if amazon is going to be so wishy-washy and sneaky, I'm going elsewhere. (wagging finger at amazon!)<br /><br />I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back.<br /><br />Heavens to Besty, this stuff ROCKS!! It is such a good value too, maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around.  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder, and this is certainly top-notch.  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price!!<br />I am not a raw foodie per say, but I try to follow a neo-paleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao.  Properly prepared, with just enough natural sweetener, I think this is a truly guilt-free pleasure.  It is LOADED with antioxidants, as you probably know.  So go ahead, get the big bag.  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food ""of the Gods"" (theobroma) as they say :)<br />My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa- I just whisk it into gently heated fresh (raw) whole milk or cream (so it's not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible, I know it's not 100% raw  but hey this is how I love it!), add just enough sweetener (I like sorghum molasses, a scant t-spoon), a bit of maca powder, a dash of real salt, and after that's thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL- YUMM!!! I have converted everyone, even the kids I babysit (who used to prefer swiss miss). Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk, lightly sweetened.  You better believe it goes fast!!  I love my family to get their good old fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A, D and the X- factor (read Weston A Price) and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot.  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feel good and happy!!<br />Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles- refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil.  I often toss in soaked,dried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars. just process in batches so it's kind of homogenous. Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw.<br />Go for it! Buy this huge bag, share the goodness and you'll be healthier and happier for it. I guarantee!!  PEACE be with You!"
"Another love it or hate it toy.... It's a bottle, it's a spiky ball, it's a rope, it's a treat dispenser! Apparently, the choices are too overwhelming for our Vizsla puppy because she passes this one up. In addition, the hard plastic bottle makes a racket on our hard kitchen floor, so maybe it's a blessing after all :)"
"I was a little bit concerned because some of the reviews for the other Cafe Altura Organic coffees are not very good, but I decided to try this one anyhow.  Glad I did.  This is a really great French roast - one of my favorites.  We will be buying this one again!"
Excellent service!  Excellent Price!  Excellent Product!  I can't keep the dog off the phone telling her friends how much she is enjoying her Best Buddy Treats!  I have a very happy dog!
My 12 month old loves this salmon.  These containers are great for traveling and make easy meals!
This product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride.<br />I have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavor... no after-taste and I actually like the slight carbonation.<br />I use other Hammer products and really like their whole product line.
"I have a 15-lb. schnauzer-mix puppy. She's easily bored, extremely destructive & likes puzzles. This looked perfect. It takes a bit of work to get food out so I knew this would occupy her for a while. The screw-on lid at the bottom of the jug was virtually seamless and very tight. When I ran my fingers over the seam before giving it to her I could barely feel it.<br /><br />I gave it to her at 8am before I went to work. I came home for lunch at 11:30 and she had COMPLETELY destroyed it! She located the seam and, somehow, wedged her teeth into it, worked her way around the circumference and pried the lid loose. She then chewed the lip off of the jug all the way around so the lid cannot be put back on it. She was lying there calmly and the food was all gone, so she had clearly long since finished all this in the 3.5 hours since I had given it to her."
There is a warning for this package that it has things in it that cause cancel!!!  Why would you put cancer in your food?
"I just received my order of 100 count regular bully sticks and am extremely disappointed.<br />""Only ValuePetSupplies bulk Bully Sticks are hand measured for consistent thickness"". I beg to differ.<br />The ""regular"" size is quoted as 9/16"" thickness. The product I received is less than 4/16"" in thickness.<br />Out of 100 pieces, less than five actually measured up to the regular thickness advertised.<br />My blue heeler dispatched one piece in less than a minute. It usually takes him five minutes.<br /><br />On the other hand, my toy fox terrier is still working on hers and won't leave leftovers for the big guy to clean up.<br />While I understand that ValuePetSupplies.com sponsors good causes, I will be spending an extra 15 cents per piece and get a much more substantial treat."
"I work in an office full of coffee drinkers.  The other day, in a 16 hour double shift, we ran our 12 cup drip machine 10 times.  It's always a bit of an informal contest to see who can bring in the most exciting new grinds from our bean stashes.  The first time I brewed a pot of Black Silk one of the guys I worked with commented on how good it was and asked what it was.  In a very level voice I answered, ""Foldiers.""  The guy was absolutely horrified for a moment, thinking he'd lost his edge in the coffee tasting arena.  Then I told him what it was and that it was a new product and he went from horrified to merely pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />In short, this has become my go-to coffee when I run out of beans or don't want to run my noisy mill and wake everyone up in the morning!  It appears that the ""Starbucks"" craze has done to coffee what the micro-brew invasion has done to beer.  Would you ever have thought you'd see wheat beer that said Budweiser on the can?"
"Love these! Well, because...we have 3 dogs (2 were unplanned children ;-) & our 60-LB German Shepherd AND our 40-LB we-have-no-clue-what-she-is dog have both choked on various shapes & sizes of rawhides. The Shepherd choked so badly that, this time, it wouldn't come up. She couldn't cough & started to literally choke to death. I actually straddled her back, attempting the only thing I  knew how to do - the human Heimlich Maneuver! Like where exactly is a dog's sternum, anyway? Well, I tried anyway and thank God it finally did dislodge & we got it out! Was it the Heimlich? I don't know. Probably not. I mean, she still won't tell me... After all, I guess it was very traumatic for her.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, what I do know, is that was the last time any of my dogs have had any kind of regular rawhide bones! Which, I really wanted to let everyone know of my personal experiences; I believe anybody who is at all concerned about giving their dogs rawhides and/or experiencing a similar problem is on the right track to avoid them.<br /><br />Our small part Chihuawa/part something else, first 2 times in-a-row, threw up repeatedly w/rawhide pieces and w/foam. He was VERY sick the 3rd time, so we definitely stopped that! The ONLY kind I did finally take a chance with were granulated rawhide munchy sticks, & they're all fine w/these; though I'm still nervous about them choking on a piece, but neither of them have had any problems with Boodas so far, & they don't swell up in their throats like regular rawhides.<br /><br />So, now... It's Booda Bones!<br /><br />Yes, they are a bit on the pricey side, especially for my 2 larger aggressive chewers. I agree with some other reviewers that they are not very long-lasting. But it's all I'll give them now. But, for my half Chihuahua/half something else(20lbs), I give him the smallest ones and they are like mega-saurus bones for him(it is my hope that the manufacturer will start selling these in bulk packages, for less $). I get 3 different sizes for my 3 different whatever-they-are-dogs. They absolutely love them! This includes the assorted flavors, the bacon-flavored, and the yogurt-flavored. Whichever is cheaper at the time and shipped by Amazon.<br /><br />And I owe a big thank you to Brian Amazon, all of you for all of your reviews, Booda Bones, and Amazon!<br /><br />** Confession: This was originally a comment I posted to a reviewer by the name of ""Brian Amazon"" a long time ago. I have been buying Bones from Amazon, and, only Booda Bones, ever since. They are so great that I've been wanting to write a review, & now finally have the chance to (I have, however, resorted to copying and pasting much of my original [brief... LOL] comment, with some editing)."
"I had recently tried Pocket Coffee a friend brought back from Italy. And it was one of the best chocolate I ever had! I searched and brought this product at Amazon... but I am extremely disappointed... This is not the same as what you can get from Italy. ""Instant Maxwell coffee"" in the middle of ""Hershey's chocolate"" just doesn't compare with the real thing..."
Great item at a great price!  Fast delivery and free shipping.  I was very satisfied with this high quality olive oil in that size bottle.  I got two bottles and will get more in the future if the price remains the same.
"I think my dog was just too smart for this toy.  I purchased one of the larger ones with the rubber rope.  After 5 minutes of frustration in trying to get the treats out, my dog chewed through the rubber rope so that she could just empty the treats out the hole.  It was a waste of money for my dog to try out.  With the fabric-type rope, the toy might have lasted longer for her."
"Recieved the tea very quickly with very  helpful, detailed brewing instructions.  Tea is absolutely delicious!!!!!!  Like dessert in a cup!!!!"
"That's exactly what I was looking for to bake some chouquettes (puffs with small sugar pearls on top). Works great, yum!!"
Great flavor.  I snack on these when I need a boost of energy.  They help satisfy cravings between meals.
"Addictive and totally unexpected. I first tasted these at the Fancy Food Show in New York a couple of years ago. Was amazed to find them on Amazon - and bought immediately for our lunch clients. What you want in a potato chip: the crunch is fantastic and the flavor gives off both rosemary and olive oil, ending in a surprisingly smoky note."
"I cannot tell whether this product is good or bad since it is nigh impossible to get much of it out of the tube.  I even put it in one of those tube rollers used for toothpaste and it still does not want to leave its ""home."" I have run it under hot water and that did not work.  My next plan is to take my box cutter and cut it open!  The person who ""thought"" this should be in a tube, should be fired.  They have obviously never tried to get it out!!"
"In court, as I understand it, you're not supposed to testify about anything where you don't have direct experience.  You can discount this review if you want, since I have only second hand experience with this soup.<br /><br />I gave a case of this soup to a young friend who is a college student (I worry about her starving).  She never mentioned whether she liked the soup, so I asked.  She finally admitted that it was, to quote her, ""The worst thing I've ever tasted"".  Apparently her boyfriend also tried it and thought it was bad as well.  While my friend is rather picky, her boyfriend has a much wider culinary range, so if they both disliked the soup, I'm inclinded to think it's not very good."
"Iv'e tried a few different gluten-free breads and they all left a LOT to be desired.  I ate them only because I hadn't stumbled across this brand of bread mix yet.  When I did, I really liked it and then I ordered it by the 6-pak.  I've made, plain, cheese and cinnaman in my breadmaker and have enjoyed them all.  I do have to hold myself back from slicing off the first warm piece and loading it with butter.  Other then that I have NO complaints."
"This popcorn was pretty good although like some of the other reviews read ... about half the seeds popped.  Maybe we'll order again,  but for now we are using the big bags of popcorn and coconut oil that are sold separately.  They pop bigger and nearly all the seeds pop using them."
"This is the first time I've used the coconut oil from Manila Coco Factory and I was so pleased with the taste, smell and overall incredible quality that I will buy more and recommend it to my family and friends.  I am so glad I tried it. I have been using coconut oil for several years and it has changed my life and health.  This oil ranks high in my book. Also, I liked ordering this product through amazon because they make it fast, easy and painless. Thank you for having this product on your site Amazon."
"Baby white popcorn from Wabash Farms pops nicely, has no meanacing hulls to get into your teeth, and is very tasty. What more could you ask from a popcorn? I highly recommend this product. At least a four star."
"This product is great! I would recommend purchasing xanthan gum as well, because it isn't as stable as Bisquick in the dough holding together, just a tiny bit works wonders. As mentioned before, it can be purchased for less than half the price from Netrition. The blueberry muffins are delicious, and I use regular Bisquick recipes substituting Carbquik and sugar substitute and have had no bad results."
"What can I say..Amazon does it again...A huge amount of M&M's for a very small price.<br />What makes this a good deal as well is that they are all the individually wrapped M&M packages.<br />These are a great size for snacks, desserts, etc. where you don't want to sit and eat 300 of them..."
"I finally gave in and bought these expensive chews because the others we have used only last a few minutes. The package claims to provide ""hours of entertainment"" for your pet. What a ripoff! They didn't mention you would have to buy a case of these things and feed your dog a big meal of bull hide for it to last hours. I have a seventy-pound mixed breed dog, Roscoe, who is four years old. He doesn't chew for entertainment like a puppy would, but when it comes to eating, he is a real chewer. The kibble he eats is the size of puppy kibble and he thoroughly chews every bite. Well, I just gave Roscoe a bully spring and it was thoroughly chewed and eaten in under ten minutes. My seven month old puppy isn't quite as fast as him, but she too can put one away in minutes. The pig skin rolls at the supermarket last longer, and they aren't advertised and priced in a way that victimizes customers."
"We purchased these to have on hand for our 7 yr old son and he loves them. As an adult I really like them when I am craving some sort of candy. If I grab one of these... I know it is only 100 calories... and it does have chocolate and candy :) so it is good for those kinds of fixes. I wouldn't say these are healthy by any means, but in moderation, they are better than other things."
"I'm a relative newcomer to Keurig coffee, but I do know that I was generally disappointed in the drink produced. However, the Breakfast in Bed K-Cup produces a nicely balanced, not-too-thin cup without being too harsh. I still haven't achieved anything like what I can make either with my french press or with my drip machine, but it's definitely better than the at-work alternative, Community Coffee."
i love the taste of lavender but if you use to much it can be soapy tasting and thats just really bad..
"Cats are finicky animals and what one loves another won't touch - that is not a reflection on the food itself. I have two Burmese and their eating habits are very different. My local Pet Nutrition Center kindly gave me a sample of Prowl the other day and while my one cat absolutely loves it, the other won't touch it. That's why samples are nice. Both of my cats have been on Evo kibble, but this one cat who now loves the Prowl, has a habit of throwing up and I'm on the prowl myself for an alternative food that will help her keep food down. So far, no barf. She also laps it up as soon as I've added warm water - no waiting. I highly recommend you obtain a sample and let the cat decide, as the food is economical as well as healthy."
"Don't waste your money. The ingredients list includes 'spices' which obviously means cinnamon. I simply do not understand cinnamon being used in chili. Even after adding ground beef, diced tomatoes and shredded cheese on top... the taste was still disgusting!"
"When cooking according to instructions in microwave it keeps making popping noises and eventually it pops really loud and flies up and spills all over the place at about 1:15 secs in my microwave, WTF? It has done it to me three times in a row, then I tried it in my sisters microwave and had the same exact problem. I'm not sure this stuff is even safe!"
"What can I say that you probably don't already know?  It's Monster, a caffeine drink that is mostly sugar water.<br /><br />The problem is that I can find this MUCH cheaper in regular stores."
"Package arrived DOUBLE boxed, wrapped, and the inside box(that holds the goods) perfect not a single dent or rough mark, outstanding packaging.<br /><br />The Product?<br /><br />These are the best chips on the planet, Salt 'N Vinegar flavor is beyond among the best chips I've ever had. You might, actually I'm sure you probably won't like it AT FIRST BITE 'IF' you have never had these before. But try it again.<br /><br />Not to mention, this particular flavor has held up in numerous surveys and comparisons against other manufactures."
"I have been a Subscribe and Save customer for a few years.  Amazon has recently changed their packaging of this item.  For the second order in a row, I've received the case with a label on it.  There's no bubble wrap or larger box around it at all.  So what I have received is going to essentially be six boxes of cracker crumbs.  I'll be returning the order and canceling my subscription now.  I'd rather pay a higher price for a box of useable crackers than get a case of crumbs."
"I have two dogs: one is not very good at figuring out puzzle toys, even with scaffolding and attempts at teaching him, the other is like a dog genius. That, coupled with her highly food driven motivation, usually leads to her mastering these types of treat toys instantly. This is the only item I've ever purchased that she can't manipulate well. Unlike some of these other types of dog toys, I also find that it has to be fairly full to work well. She's a relatively small dog and even if I put all of her kibble in the smallest jar, it's even tough for me to get it all out with the little pull rope because it sinks to the bottom of bottle and has to go up the bottle neck to exit. Also, because I have two dogs, sometimes the other dog wants to come in and play, too. This works nicely with the ball dispensers, but for this jar, if they both pull on the rope, the motion required to actually get the treats or kibble out immediately becomes impossible. Regardless of the number of dogs in your household, this is one toy I'd pass on.<br /><br />Update: My medium chewer has now completely chewed apart the rubber pull rope with this. If I could change my original 1 star rating to a zero, I would."
"Pop Chips are basically a horribly over-priced version of ""Munchos"" which are baked potato chips and have been around forever. Period."
I have spent a lot of time in Scotland and I could not swallow these- dusty and dry- I threw them out
"Ok, sounds crazy i know but i heard about this baby food diet and figured whats there to loose. The food tastes good, and im sure your baby will like it too hahaha!"
We love it! it tastes great and is so easy. Thanks for a terrific product. We love also that it has no transfats!
"though i did not purchase this through amazon, i did get this recently from thw grocery store, and have to admit im really disappointed.  i followed the instructions the first evening EXACTLY as instructed with the included paper, and no results.  the second day, i brewed just a little longer, still no luck, (basing this off some other comments from other users here on amazon) then today i only did 6oz, not 12 as the paper instructs, and even brewed this for 6 minutes.  still nothing.<br /><br />i really wanted this to work for me like it has for others, i had heard good things and was so excited, but still no luck.  i guess im one of those people this doesnt affect. ill keep trying it daily till i run out, but looks like ill have to try something else.<br /><br />as for taste, its not bad. just tastes like tea leaves, not deliciously fantastic, but not nose-pinchingly undrinkable. good luck to anyone else. hope you have more success with this than i did"
"Box arrived via Fed-X in it's special insulated foam mini-cooler with ice-pack. All were ready to put in the freezer. This shipping by Amazon is incredible. Tip: save the mini-cooler for trips to Safeway, Trader Joe's etc.<br /><br />I've had Nan at a lot of restaurants, Indian, Pakastani, etc. There's no discern-able difference in quality. And the convenience of being able to make it ""on demand"" at home is really nice.<br /><br />Re: preparation. I entirely agree with the other reviewer who recommended pan frying. No need to preheat an oven to 400 and bake 5 to 10 minutes or so. And here's another Tip:  use a non-stick pan, and you won't have to add olive oil. Just defrost first at room temp (only 30 minutes or less), then pan-fry less than a minute each side and you're ready to eat. It's hotter than you'll get at any restaurant.<br /><br />If you don't want to pan fry or waste a lot of energy preheating your oven to 400 then baking 10 minutes, here's another way my Mom discovered. Just pop the Naan right from the freezer into a high quality toaster (she has a DeLonghi). It's very quick, and tastes great. She says toasting brings out the flavor of the garlic more.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
"I ordered this because Amazon recommended it to go along with the Redenbacker popcorn popper I got from them. Hey, only a few of these actually pop! Most of these small, unpopped kernels get thrown out of the popper. What an absolute waste of money!"
"The Altoids Wintergreen mints are my favorite flavor of all time! Everybody always compliments me on how great my breath smells (I know it's kinda weird)! Anyways, I would absolutely recommend these mints!"
"Note: I bought these from a grocery store, so i don't think i had the problem of a 'stale' product as in the other reviewers.  However, i bought both an unseasoned brand (a CVS brand) and this Emerald seasoned brand and i vastly prefer the seaseoned version of these walnuts.  It's unbelievably tasty.<br /><br />I'm going to try to order from amazon soon and hopefully i won't have a problem with staleness, but my initial reaction is: WOW, these taste great!"
"It was as good, if not better, than I was told!  Great taste!  I will puchase it again."
"These are actually very tasty little gummies and my little boy loves them. Make's a great treat. Quite a few fit into the package and they are decently sized as well. The gummi center is actually solid though, in case of any misunderstanding."
"Wow. I had bought it wondering what turkish delight was after watching narnia of course. I ordered it through a turkish grocery website but figured the review here would be more helpful as it's the same brand. I love the smell because I like rose scented things, and the texture i thought was good, but the taste? It was, like other reviewers have said, eating rose potpourri. I just can't get past it. I'm sure it's an acquired taste but I don't think I'll ever get used to it. Even an hour later I could still taste it faintly and I keep shuddering lol. My 4 year old wants to eat the whole box. But then again, she's positive she's a princess so she should be eating flowery stuff. :P Maybe sometime I'll be brave enough to try a different flavor, but I'm afraid the lemon will taste like a lemon peel."
"Terrible clunky product.. drawer doesn't open/close without making clunky noises.  Not a space saver, hard on the eyes.  Would return it for a refund if I weren't terribly lazy.  Go to Bed Bath and Beyond and use a 20% off coupon for something else.  Not worth it."
I bought this along with the easy freeze ice cube trays for my two dogs. My vet put my lab on a diet so I have been looking for low calories treats to feed him for his evening snack. Each packet is only 30 calories and will fill one easy freeze ice cube tray (six large ice cubes for the extra large size). One packet will also fill my labs kongxl and my terriers Kong medium. They love it and make sure they lick their Kong's clean without getting bored with it. Overall a great snack!
I was disappointed in the unpleasant flavor and dry texture of Nana's Chocolate Munch Cookie Bars. To me there was an odd artificial almost chemical like after taste in them that cocoa powder can't even cover up. I threw away the entire box after tasting the first bar.
"This is great chilled and topped with fresh whipped cream.  It is my husband's new favorite dessert.<br /><br />I don't find the texture off-putting.  Of course, is isn't as crunchy as fresh fruit, but the taste is great.<br /><br />If I can get my husband to eat fruit instead of ice cream it gets an A in my book!"
"Taste is a personal thing, isn't it.  So I'll just tell you(as a gauge) my all time favorite K-cup is Timothy's Midnight Magic a ""california roast"" (which is dark). I'm partial to dark roasts and probably would not have even bothered with this Sorrento, but a friend had it, so I tried it, and lo and behold - I'm very glad I did. I find this blend even better than Puck's ""Kopei Ray"" which is his dark roast. There's a whole lot of good flavor here - the word ""luscious"" comes to mind. This one's not available every where and comes at a slight cost premium. I say it's worth it. These will be a regular for me. PS: A suggestion (which seems apparent); as with any k-cup, when you try a new blend, use the plain old 1 cup setting to check it out undiluted the first time."
"I was one of fifty families chosen to receive Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for free to do a product review on.  Once I received my Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters in the mail, I and two of my grandsons decided to do the taste test immediately.<br /><br />The box of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters comes with five individual packages.  Each package is 100 calories.  In fact, the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are advertised as being 100 calorie packs so that people will know exactly how many calories they are having so there is no guesswork involved.  Each 100 calorie package comes with three Oreo mini cakesters which translates to each mini cakester having approximately thirty-three and one third calories.<br /><br />The appearance of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters is one of tiny chocolatey goodness.  They are a dark chocolate color with a thin slice of cream filling and are soft and slightly crumbly.  When you put a Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters into your mouth, they crumble into a delicious chocolate cake flavor.  In fact, they do remind me a little of having a small bite of chocolate cake.  The Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters mostly have a chocolate flavor and the cream filling isn't as easily tasted or rather it wasn't possible to isolate the flavor of the cream from the chocolate but I didn't have a problem with this and neither did either of my grandsons.<br /><br />My oldest grandson ate almost two 100 calories packs of the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters minus one or approximately 167 calories.  He enjoyed eating them and even gave Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters his `lick of approval' to the wrapper they came in!<br /><br />My youngest grandson isn't able to communicate effectively verbally (he's special needs) but I considered his dedication to eating his Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters as a sign of approval as seen through his chocolate face and intensity as he ate his 100 calorie pack plus the one loose one from his older brother or his approximately 134 calories.<br /><br />I definitely give the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters a thumbs up.  I believe that I really got a true sense of how good they tasted from my two 100 calorie packs or 200 calories worth of Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters that I ate. I honestly didn't mean to eat both 100 calorie packs but that last one was sitting there calling my name and my adult daughter was not home yet so, I ate it.  But luckily I know that all I had was 200 calories which in the grand scheme of things is not too bad at all!<br /><br />I like the fact that the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are presented as a 100 calorie pack.  I found the thought comforting especially since I ate two packages of them!  I even found it fun to know how many calories my grandsons were consuming of them too!!  I am diabetic and overweight besides so knowing the calorie count is a good thing for me.  I think the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters are good for a small chocolatey treat when you just want something sweet and chocolate but you don't want to overindulge.<br /><br />If I have any complaint about the Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters, it would be that they are too small!!  But since that is actually part of their appeal, I don't consider their small size a problem.<br /><br />I do recommend Nabisco Oreo Mini Cakesters for anyone who wants a small and controlled portion of a chocolate treat because they are the perfect size to keep you in control of your diet instead of letting the chocolate treat control you."
"I have been drinking oolong tea for several months now. I find it quite a nice morning beverage instead of coffee. It is also a great pick me up in the afternoon. One of the benefits of oolong tea is increased energy, which for me it works. This oolong tea is great tasting and light flavored. I will definitely continue to purchase it."
"Received my syrup broken, was packed very poorly. After salvaging some it tasted almost similar to a cigar. After reading the reviews i thought maybe it was just me, but i didnt bother getting another to try it."
"We looked forward to receiving this product because it was no longer carried in our local store, however, when we received it, the name was the same, ""Gold Kili Ginger Drink,"" but the ingredients were completely different.  I still have a couple packets of the Ginger Drink we used to buy and the ingredients are, ""Ginger and Honey.""  When we received this product, the ingredients were high fructose corn syrup, among other additives.  Upon seeing this, we promptly returned the item."
My dog is on a meat free diet due to severe food alllergies. She loves this food and her coat is actually coming back in areas which there was no hair. I rotate this and another vegan dog food sold here on Amazon. I will be ordering more soon! The price is cheaper on here then at Petsmart.
"Although I can not say that these are the same thing as potato chips, they are a good alternative and very tasty. The flavors are much like the potato chips you would get at the store; it is the texture that is different. They are less oil (a good thing) and lighter than potato chips almost like a rice cake except much thinner and crisper. All of the flavors are good except for the cheese one. I didn't care for it although my two-year-old likes it.<br /><br />All-in-all, for the calories, you can't beat it, and for long term weight maintenance and health, these are great and delicious as well. Amazon.com sends out a very fresh product that is as good as if you bought it from the shelf of your local grocery store."
"Have Australian Shepherd,  Shelties, and a Minature Doberman and they all LOVE the Rise and Shine.  Unfotunately, the only retailer carrying this product is 50 miles away.  Thanks for stocking this item."
"My AKC English Bulldog has been using greenies since he was a puppy, and hasnt had any problems with it. Ive always given him the correct size greenie for his weight, and have never had to take him to the vet. (yet I never leave him unattended with his greenie) The only problem I had with this particular seller was the picture on display, and what I recieved in the mail. Please don't make the same mistake I did, there are only 17 greenies in the box, would have been better off buying them at Petsmart."
"Im on a quest to try all the Ramen Flavors. Ramen is a good lunch for me, being easy to make, cheap and versital. The Chicken flavor is one I remember but I havent had it in a long time, its one of the only flavors sold in stores where I live. I made some recently. Its better than I remember, salty but good. This is one of the more americanized flavors. I recommend NOT adding 2 cups of water. I added a bit more than 1 1/4 cup. and it was perfect. 1 1/4- 1 1/3 or 1 1/2 seems to be the perfect amount. I like eating it as a soup so I dont pour out the water. You can add things to Ramen like meat, eggs, or vegetarian protein and frozen veggies to make it a more filling meal or eat it plain. Or dont use the seasoning packet and add your own seasonings. Whatever you like. This is a great product, I recommend if you want easy, cheap lunches."
"I first tasted this coffee as a sample with my new Keurig.  It wasn't available locally, so I tried Emeril's.  The Newman's own is really just as strong, but MUCH SMOOTHER.  It's delicious, and by far the best I've tried so far."
This is my husband's new favorite tea! I'm not huge on hibiscus but this does taste good. I'm sure we'll be buying more.
"I always wanted to try out Canidae for my dogs, and when I saw the price Amazon offered for these, I had to go for it. The ingredients are awesome except carrageenan, and before I purchase, I read the reviews for concerning it contains carrageenan. Yes, I read about the study that it caused cancer in the lab rats, although it is a naturally derived from the nature. Carrageenan is in many food items for humans too, to provide thickness and sliminess to the food. Even for those healthy soy milk, it's very hard to find the ones that does not come with Carrageenan. There's always something that may or may not cause cancer, but we always have to remember that it does not cause immediately, and only taken in large quantities. So my judgement is that if I don't give the dog food that contains Carrageenan ""all the time"", then my dogs should be okay. So if you want to entirely avoid anything that may cause cancer, then you don't want to buy these. Otherwise, they are fabulous dog foods, and I'll just wish that Canidae come up with something else in the future to add sliminess to it."
"This gum has a great aromatic flavor, and truly does help those with stomach issues.  I tend to go through 20 pieces in a setting, so large boxes do help.  Eat like chicklets, be a kid again."
"Unlike the other coconut water products I've purchased, this one contains sugar and the container is smaller.  These two facts must be stated in the description but I had not noticed till I got the order.  The drink tastes OK if one likes guava."
"My boyfriend just got fired from his job b/c he was required to do a drug test and it showed positive for cocaine.  He does not do cocaine.  The day of the test he did happen to have 2 cups of Delisse Mate De Coco and he didn't think anything about it.  It's actually sold in the US and being sold on sites like Amazon.com b/c these distributors are outside of the U.S., people have brought it back through customs with no issues (his mom brought it from Ecuador) and he has found scientific journals supporting that the coca leaf or the coca leaf teas that are sold or brought into the US are actually listed as ""illegal"" by the US Government.  Here is the link to the US Department of Justice CLEARLY stating that ""coca leaf"" is a schedule II substance and illegal.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />DO NOT DRINK THIS TEA IF YOU ARE AT RISK FOR A DRUG TEST OR GETTING RANDOM DRUG TESTED AT WORK.  I've also seen reviews on other coca leaf teas where people have given warnings about losing a job opportunity.<br /><br />If you did get fired, it's really hard to fight b/c most will just see a positive drug test for cocaine. The only other ways to test positive for cocaine metabolites is if you actually did cocaine or have a major disease such as Kidney or Liver Disease.  If you never drank coca leaf, then I would suggest you go to a doctor to make sure you don't have liver or kidney disease.  It would really suck to get fired for having a disease and having a disease that created cocaine metabolites would be something you could really fight legally, in my opinion, b/c at that point it's wrongful termination.  In Texas if you get fired for a drug test even if you had no previous disciplinary action you can not receive unemployment.  He's even spoken to an Employment Lawyer and they said it'll be hard for him to fight in court.<br />If you or anyone has questions on this, we both have been researching things and can direct you to some advice, discussion or articles on this matter, please feel free to email me at:  MusicRocksInAustin@gmail.com."
"I ordered this item and several other choclate items from Euro Food Mart and was sorely disappointed in the products I received. They arrived melted. I didn't realize that I needed to have them shipped EXPEDITED. I mistakenly assumed that by paying $12 for shipping, the items would arrive with some kind of coolant. Previous to placing the order I clicked on the Shipping link for detail, and perused the chart that appeared. I failed to scroll down and see the information stating that in order to assure the use of ice gels, orders needed to be Expedited. So, on a $26 order, I would pay an additional $30+ for Expedited delivery. When I initially received my melted chocolates, I contacted Euro Food Mart and received a very rude and curt reply from Cris in Customer Service informing me that during the checkout process I was offered shipping with ice gels, but I chose to decline it. Sadly, the melted chocolates did not fair any better after being refrigerated. They cracked easily and no filling was discernable. Admittedly, it was my mistake not to notice the note on Expedited shipping, however, the response from Euro Food Mart's Customer Service lacked objectivity. My rating reflects my entire experience....quality of shipped product and customer service provided by Euro Food Mart."
"I really like Pho at local restaurants, so was not expecting much from a packaged product.  I really enjoyed this, and found it to be a creditable version of the great soup that takes hours to prepare the long way.  Will keep buying regularly."
"Although I have had the Better Than Ears treats for several months, I just opened the package last night and our Lhasa loved the smoky bacon flavor and sat in front of her treat container begging for more."
"Every morning this is my second cup. It's smooth, has a really nice ""coffee"" taste and leaves me feeling satisfied for that coffee urge. I can drink this cold it's that good! Too bad the prices keep going up!"
"My dog, a 13 year old Bichon Frise' has been loving these Greenies for many years. Our vet says that his teeth and gums are excellent although he has never had his teeth cleaned or brushed. Could it be the Greenies? I'm sure of it.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KEVF32"">Greenies Dental Chews for Dogs, Regular, Pack of 27</a>"
"I gave these treats to my chihuahua mix and he developed renal failure.  I then found out the FDA had issued a warning about these treats causing renal failure.  I'm amazed Amazon is still selling them.  My dog just spent 2 days getting IV fluids at the vets and may still not survive.  Yes, he absolutely loved these treats.  But please, at the very least, read about the warnings and what's happened to other animals before thinking about giving them to your pet."
"If you like strong, black tea, then this is the one for you!  My grandfather owned a tea plantation in Assam, India, so I am an admitted tea snob who would only drink tea fresh from the plantation.  It is extremely difficult to find a good domestic black tea within the U.S. (The U.S. is a coffee country, not a tea country - and herbal tea is not real tea!!!).  Black tea within the U.S. is generally weak, watered down and has no taste.  I was pleasantly surprised by this brand of teas (Taylor's of Harrogate in general).  All of the teas that I have tried of this brand have been good, but the Irish breakfast tea in particular is excellent (for packaged tea).  It is a wonderful blend of African and Assamese black teas, with a bold, strong flavor and color.  It is excellent with milk and sugar.  I indulge in a cup of tea with biscuits (cookies!) each afternoon!  :-)"
"These almonds are nothing short of incredible- they are so delicious! If you are trying to follow a low-carb lifestyle (for dietary reasons or weight loss) and need a 'sweet fix' after meals, then this is a wonderful option - only 6 g. Net carbs! And the taste is so yummy! They are just sweet enough! I'm so glad that amazon sells them in bulk, because I could easily go through one container in a week!"
"This tea tastes pleasant for your first 2 or 3 sips. Then it starts tasting pretty foul. I hate, hate, hate how they put Stevia into it. If I want my tea sweeter, allow me to put my own sweetener in it. Not only do they assume how sweet you want your tea, but they use Stevia which leaves an AWFUL after-taste as well as giving anything that contains it a weird, not yummy, sweet taste. I prefer my tea unsweetened as it is, but if I do choose to sweeten anything I drink, I use conventional sugars that don't taste terrible.<br /><br />It does give a bit of a relaxing feel, but the Stevia really ruins it. I wish I could just take it out!"
I purchased the Turkey pouches because my 8 month old loved the Chick Chick.  This is nothing like the Chick Chick.  This looks like a dry paste and it smells bad too.  Currently I'm mixing them with a jar of the Earth's Best Organics 2oz veggie jar in order to give it some texture other than cat food.  This is absolutely nothing like the Chick Chick with is a hearty puree with actual pieces of chicken and pasta.  I would not recommend it.
"My daughter that has autism craves hot, spice and pungent foods.  These are her absolute favorite chips!  She calls them her sour chips and wants them in her lunch all the time.  I love the crispy kettle way they're cooked."
"I started drinking coconut water when it was suggested to me by a friend.  I never really loved the taste of it, but I spend a great deal of time in the desert and I just can't seem to suck down enough water without getting waterlogged, so I was excited when I found flavors.  I know that recently it's become trendy and much harder for me to find, but my friends have been drinking it for years, as has my yoga instructor, and they highly recommend it for drinking not only for sports, but also to keep hydrated.  Plus, it's done wonders for my always dry skin.<br /><br />If nothing else it's a great avoid a hangover cure if drunk before going to bed, and if your partied too much to avoid being sick it seems to work much better than Pedialyte to get your electrolytes back in balance."
I like this product because it is a very fast working product.  It works every time and you know what to expect. No unexpected emergencies.  Very smooth!!
"Just purchased a 50 count box. Previous reviews had indicated that there were probblems with the cups and that they ""leaked"" grounds into the coffee cup. Sadly, this is still the case. About 1 in 5 cups is defective.Taste is fine as long as you don't mind chunky coffee. Will NOT be buying this again!!!"
"My, oh my, what a deliciouos aroma pours out of this bag of peppercorns.  Nothing has the taste of a toasted Szechuan peppercorn.  They arrived in excellent condition and very, very fresh.  Love them!"
I though this product lack flavor as I taste different brands far better.<br />There were no real flavor as I expected. Sorry
Definitely not extra bold...medium roast at best.  Not particularly memorable...doesn't have a good coffee aroma...but it's pretty decent tasting.  At this point I'm not sure if I would reorder.
"I've given up on cows milk products....it interferes with my digestion, creates constipation and gas.  I decided to try this powdered goats milk because I remembered that my parents told me that I was allergic to cows milk when I was a baby and they gave me goats milk instead, but then switched me to cows milk when I was old enough to tolerate it.  I wish they had left me on the goats milk growing up because I find that my body tolerates it much better, and I think I would have been healthier as a child growing up if I'd had goats milk instead of cows milk.<br /><br />I use it to make my own kefir, yogurt, custards and whatever else I need milk for.  I was a bit dubious when I first bought it....I didn't know if I would like the taste of it or not, but....I love the taste and the smell of it.  Mmmmmm.....Yum. The taste at first reminded me a tiny bit of the flavor of lamb.....and I love lamb....but this taste is so slight that it's not noticable in kefir (which makes the most delicious pancakes), or yogurt or in custard or any other baked goods.  I like the taste and smell of this goats milk better than cows milk.<br /><br />I also like the powdered milk because I can make it up a cup at a time or a quart at a time, as I need it, and never have to worry about having to store it in the refrigerator or it going bad or spoiling.  It's very convenient.<br /><br />It takes a few minutes for it to dissolve and be absorbed into warm water when first mixing it, but once it is all dissolved in the water, I can't tell the difference between this powdered milk and fresh milk.  It dissolves and mixes quickest in a blender."
"these are a good thing for you and sometimes hard to find in a larger container at the store, so these make it much easier and there a good price here."
"Ingredients listed: Pure cane sugar, and 100% pure powdered Japanese green tea.<br /><br />Nutrition Facts: all 0%, except Sodium (15mg) and Sugar (12g)<br /><br />Basic Instructions: add one packet to 8oz of cold water and stir or shake well to dissolve...<br /><br />My Opinion: It is too sweet for my taste, even diluted in a 16.9oz water bottle. It almost tastes like sugar water. I think the unsweetened version would be better. 5 star because it delivers what it promises.<br /><br />This is Japanese green tea. NOT Chinese green tea. There is a difference."
Perfect!! They are my favorite because I can season with a variety of spices to exactly suit my tastes without all the salt!
"I love Revv Pulse.  I find it very flavorful for when you want something strong.  I don't know if it gives me any more energy than a regular coffee, but it can't hurt, and I actually think the Pulse variety tastes better than the regular Revv flavor.  I'm a huge fan of my Keurig and have tried almost every brand and flavor, and I dig this stuff."
"Broadway Strawberry Rolls-when I was a kid-and later, the Ruehllers from Denmark as well, were my Favorite candy-ever!!! They were sold in Solvang, Ca for a few years!<br />Recently, someone bought the Broadway name and are making these rolls again! I am an expert-been eating these since I was 5!!!<br />This new batch is an utter ABOMINATION!!! These are WRETCHEDLY AWFUL!!!! Change the name to OFF Broadway Rolls! These are REALLY off!!!<br />This is as if Yoko Ono toured as The BeaTles!!! Like comparing a Big Mac to the best Fillet Mignon! Like comparing Katy Perry to Joni Mitchell!!!<br />Like comparing The Flaming Lips to Pink Floyd....<br />Like comparing Sarah Bernhardt to Natalie Wood...<br />Anyway, they went from the BEST candy to a contender for Worst!!! Don't be fooled!!! This has No taste! Oh! Actually...it Does!!! It's AWFUL...!!! Yech!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Want great licorice???? Get the Australian kind! at World Market or any fine candy store!!!  Realllly good! or Lindt Intense Orange! Yummmy dark chocolate!<br /><br />I WOULD rate this -5 stars!!!!!!!!"
"My dog loved the original Purina One Adult Chicken with Rice Dog Food.  However, since Purina developed the smart-blend, she won't eat it unless I add some turkey.  The tan color pieces are awful - kind of rubbery.  I went back to buying the regular Purina Chicken and Rice Mix where all the morsels are pretty much the same in size and color.  My dog really likes the older version much better.  I won't be buying the blend mixture again. Sometimes, change isn't better."
these are great. my baby loves them. it is one of his favorite foods and he's a picky little guy. they actually taste good and buying in bulk makes them way cheaper!
eating my first bag as i type.  awesome.  some puffed up to be light and puffy; others didn't puff up as much and are much more crunchy.  Which i like!  might be the best pork rinds i've had (outside of central america street carts)
"I'm kind of addicted to these.  I like both the Hot and Spicy and the Plain Lowrey's Bacon Curls Microwave Pork Rinds, but like the Hot and Spicy best.  I found the perfect time in my microwave of 1:20, but had to experiment to find the right amount of time.  Before taking them out of the plastic I shake them a little.  Once in a while they will fly out of the bag when I try to shake it when the bag is out of the plastic and opened flat like the directions show.  You really need to get them dispersed in the bag before popping if you want full big puffy pork rinds, which I think needs to be done more than 5-6 times like the directions state.  Some bags do seem fuller than others, however.  I have to agree these do stink when taken out of the microwave.  I turn my stove fan on before taking them out of the microwave and pour them out of the bag under the fan and hold the bag and bowl up to the fan for a few seconds.<br />I've tried dipping these into ranch dressing which is a bit of a treat too, but seems to make the porky too soggy, but I like the taste of it."
"Our cats ran to their bowls to try their first bits of Avoderm dry food, properly mixed in with their regular fancy kibble. Being Maine Coons with crafty little paws and ambitious little brains, they managed to pick out the Avoderm bits and eat those first.<br /><br />Yum, a hit! It smells meaty and clearly appeals to them.<br /><br />But we won't be buying Avoderm again....the poo is horrific. Wet, runny, stinky beyond belief. My big boy, who did mind his manners and ate a graduated amount of the mix over a week as the bag described, had the worst reaction of all. Poor guy cried as he pooped, had diarrhea everywhere, and calmly climbed into the laundry sink for washing as if he understood he was a stinky boy.<br /><br />So yes, it is tasty and priced well, but the aftermath is not worth it. 12 paws and two thumbs down."
"This is my favorite so far amongst the Wolfgang Puck K-Cups. The word that comes to mind when i sip it is ""Bright"". It has a natural sweetness and good flavor, without being overly heavy. The packaging lists it as a Medium Roast, but i'd put it more towards the light end of the spectrum. It's a very enjoyable cup, and i'd recommend if you are looking for something to switch up with Green Mountian's popular Vermont Country Blend or Breakfast Blend.<br /><br />I generally haven't been impressed with the Wolfgang Puck flavored varieties (Vanilla Francaie, Jamaica me Crazy), but this regular cup is quite good."
The company does not operate properly I ordered the French Vanilla.  That is the selection I clicked on and I recieved the White Chocolate. They should contact a buyer BEFORE shipping a substitution.
I bought this thinking that I could save money.  The taste is very poor and really doesn't taste good at all.  I used it about 5 times and will throw it out as soon as I go to the grocery store again to buy another brand.
"Popchips are absolutely delicious, and getting the variety pack is great.  Everyone in my family has a favorite flavor.  Highly recommend these as they feed your chip craving, but are not nearly as bad for you as chips."
"When I read the ingredients of these treats I thought for sure that my dogs would like these. I have 3 large breed dogs which usually love to eat just about anything. I have Rocky, a black and tan coonhound, Buddy, a blue heeler and a very large pit bull named Hutch. Rocky and Buddy have turned up their noses in disdain to these treats everytime I have offered them. The pit bull Hutch will eat them very grudgingly and even then he'll leave half of the treat on the ground, this is odd because, he'll eat just about anything including tree branches. So, I wouldn't pay the higher price for these treats, my dogs just don't like them."
"Normally, this are outstanding bars.  If you dont believe it, go to a local health food store and try one (Trader Joes sells them as well).  I subscribed via Amazon a few years ago, and for whatever reason the last 3 boxes have arrived damaged.  They have a awelfull tainted taste unlike ones that are found in local stores.  They had a yellowish color (normally off white), and looked like they had been melted several times over even though the expiration date was current.  The last box, Amazon said they would fix the issue but havent.  I cannot return them because of Amazons policy.  Also interesting, I wrote a review similar to this one regarding the same issue, but Amazon deleted it off the website.  In any event, I cancelled my subcription and will contact the makers of this good product to let them know that somewhwere in the shipment process it is being mishandeling.  I would venture to say that many of the one star reviews are from people who dont know what these bars should really taste like,"
"These cookies are both yummy and well priced. I recommend them. Other cookies I like are Mrs. Fields(packaged), Chips ahoy soft baked, fig newtons, oreos, and elf cookies."
I love Wolfgang Puck products but the coffee is very disappointing.<br />There is a weak flavor - almost tastes diluted!<br />Some troll must have changed out all the real Puck products!<br />Libbie
"Pure, real mint jelly is far superior to the usual apple-mint jelly combination but is often difficult to find. Sure enough, Amazon had it, supplied by OXBO. We use it often and so ordered a case. Though it arrived in only a few days, the packaging did not protect the 12 jars inside and only three jars remained whole. The packaging was leaking and I am sure the FedEx truck smelled good!<br />I called OXBO Customer service and the very nice OXBO lady took the information and immediately promised to send a repacement case. This box arrived soon afterwards and all jars survived. Thanks to Amazon for listing this special jelly and many thanks to OXBO for their prompt replacement of the order.<br /><br />Jay Davis<br />Kirkland"
"I would actually give this coffee 2-1/2 stars, as I don't hate it, it isn't awful, but very ""meh"" for me.  As others have said, nice raspberry aroma and noticeable raspberry taste, but that's it.  The only flavor I detected (close to overriding the coffee altogether, so you could almost be drinking flavored hot water) is the raspberry.  The coffee is WEAK, no buts about it.  If you like coffee with body/""legs"", you won't be happy.  Very watery-tasting 'mouth feel.'  I can say it's weak because in order to fill my 14 oz ""cup"" I brewed *two* K-cups - one 6 oz. and one 8 oz. - likely smaller than most people would brew.  It was still weak.  I suspect that if I had brewed two 4 oz. cups it would still have tasted like raspberry water to me, because of the flavoring itself.  Not sure what I'll do with the remainder. Maybe try adding 4 oz. shots of it to a full-bodied coffee."
"The dressing is made with flax oil which is supposed to be beneficial. However, there are some people who would chant ""Fat is fat"" and scoff at the idea that one oil is better for you (me) than another. The dressing, itself, has a metallic taste I don't care for. I won't be buying it again."
"I was very disappointed by the product.  They are NOT long lasting as I was lead to believe.  I was going to buy Chewlotta's which take my dog about 2 hrs to go through 1, but I thought it was too pricey at $3 a pop.  My dog could eat this whole bag in less than 2 hours.  He does enjoy them though."
"The only good thing was that it was not sweet, but the taste was just bad. I could understand and tolerate the taste if it was an energy drink, but this is not an energy drink.  I have been very open and have tried different carbonated orange drinks, and I have to say this is the least favorites of the 9 other carbonated orange drinks.  I prefer just mixing carbonated water with orange juice."
I have two cats. My big boy has eaten these and never had a problem...as a matter of fact he has never vomited or had a hair ball since I adopted him at 2 months. My girl cat throws up every time she eats this particular flavor. Since I treat them equally these are no longer purchased. I hate to see my girl sick so I just recommend you watch your cats after you give them these treats. If not a problem...carry on.
"So after comparing this to Jay Robb, I can say that this protein is not as good. The taste isn't as good, and it doesn't mix that easy. I don't think it is horrible, just not that good.<br /><br />One thing I like about the Jay Robb is that they use hormone free chicken eggs. I sent Healty N' Fit an email asking where they get their eggs from, but they didn't reply. It is a little cheaper, but I found the Jay Robb at Vitamin Shoppe for 20 per 12ozs, which isn't bad. I have to say that I don't like the dudes picture on the bottle, but that's my only complaint."
"This product was a big disappointment.  The picture on the box is misleading.  These bars aren't chunky, the dough isn't flaky (more like cardboardy), they aren't filled with pieces of fruit, and if you didn't read the label (which claims about 30 items down the ingredient list that ""yogurt powder"" is added), you wouldn't have any idea you were eating yogurt at all.  The bars probably contain MSGs, with all of the ""natural flavorings,"" etc.  Whatever calcium and other vitamins might be present have probably been added in what the ingredients list calls a ""vitamin blend"" -- there's too little food in the bar to give you much nutrition, anyway.  The experience is very much like eating a long, thin fig bar -- only not as tasty.  The fig bars I buy at my neighborhood grocery contain sugar, but also real fruit, whole wheat, no MSGs, and no trans fats. I'd rather eat one of them. I won't be purchasing this product again."
"This is the best pick me up ever if you feel like you have no energy in the middle of the day, I just brew over ice and it wakes me up without having a high calorie caffeine soda. So much flavor I have to buy more before I run out,  I hope they never stop making these and it arrive quickly!"
"digestives are up to standard, but the poor packing from amazon left half of them crumbled before they were even out of the box"
"I have to be upfront and tell you my family loves these but I do not. I do not like baked Lays or Pringles either. This product reminded me of them, not the same but similar. My son wanted me to try them and then invest in the company. I am glad so many people like them but I will pass on eating them and it looks like it is a private company.... So no stock either."
"Received these in March 2012 and the expiration date was August 2013, so I got nearly a year and a half recommended shelf life.<br /><br />The chicken is good quality and is flavorful. Great for chicken tacos, burritos and chicken salad. Quick and easy, I rinse the contents.<br /><br />There is nearly 50 grams (10 grams per serving and the serving size is 2 ounces) of protein in each can which is one reason for selecting this product. I keep a year supply of food on hand and these fit in nicely with my food storage and rotation efforts.<br /><br />I also ordered the Tyson canned chicken and was very pleased to note the Tyson arrived at the same time and has a February 2015 recommended shelf life. I like both products and recommend both."
"These treats are great for those who are particular about what they feed their dog.  We do a wheat/corn free diet and have tried other treats from the Newman's Own line.  Our dog (a 70lb Lab/Shepherd rescue) has loved them all, but most of the others are a bit small for his size and I go through them too quickly.<br /><br />The New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats are a larger size rectangular shaped treat and a bit thicker than most of Newman's Own treats.  They stay intact in the bag and don't turn to crumbs at the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />These are 100% Organic treats with the following ingredients;<br />Barley, Lamb, Carrots, Apples, Palm Oil, Molasses.<br /><br />There is 9% crude protein and 4% crude fat.<br /><br />Very happy with this snack for our best friend!"
"So I have never tried Sencha before. Maybe it is just a ""type"" of green tea that I am not used to, but one thing is for sure, I am fanatical about my green tea. I've tried most of the premium brands at the premium stores, but never tasted a sencha like this before.<br /><br />Mine tasted like grass. No, I'm not stretching the truth; I still have it, and I'm considering sending it back. It smells like cut grass, and tastes like cut grass. Maybe I have a defect? Either way, the taste is absolutely putrid for a tea, and I think someone just mowed some grass, and put the clippings in a container.<br /><br />Again, I tried to like it after all of the hype. I steeped at the proper temperature for the proper amount of time, and even tried multiple attempts. Nope, tastes/looks/smells like grass clippings. Maybe I had the wrong expectation, but yuck.<br /><br />However, I would HIGHLY suggest the Silver Need Organic White produced by Rishi. It is now my favorite tea."
"My cat, who is of average pickiness, loved both of the chicken varieties.<br /><br />The Sesame Chicken looks and smells appealing, even to humans.  It's very recognizable as shredded white-meat chicken, finely diced carrots, and broth.  No chopped-and-formed meat by-products here!<br /><br />The Chicken Pot Pie variety is a little smellier, but not as bad as typical cat food.  It is fairly soupy, but my cat lapped it right up.  She even ate the carrots, which I would not have anticipated.<br /><br />Both products list high-quality ingredients on the label.  There is no wheat gluten, so hopefully this product is less susceptible to the melamine poisonings that have occurred with other brands.  It is made in Thailand, and I don't know what that means in terms of pet food safety.<br /><br />I like the size of the mini-cans, as they are just right for one meal for one cat.  I hate keeping smelly half-open cans of pet food in the refrigerator!"
Sooooooooo tasty that I came to Amazon looking for more as I ate the whole bag in a week!  I LOVE the sweet/salty play of tastes of this treat!  Right now I'm ordering a bag for me and one for a good friend.  Five stars plus!
"These peanuts are rock hard.  I ate a handful of peanuts and got a bad stomach ache.  They don't taste bad, and not salty at all. I don't understand why they are so hard.  Ouch.  I love the peanuts from Costco.  They are also extra large and delicious but they never hurt my stomach.  Must go back to them."
I don't get all the hype over this coffee. Not much of a head on it. Doesn't taste that great. What's the big whoop?
WOW! Is there anyone actually buying this from this source anymore? The price is double what it used to be and locally I buy it for 4.29.
This is a fantastic decaf coffee. My parents love decaf but there aren't many out there they enjoy. We've been drinking Timothy's decaf Colombian and we bought this to try it. Fantastic! I would definitely buy this again and again. It's smooth and not bitter. It's not super strong so don't expect it to be like a cappacino. This is a really great Colombian cup of coffee. You won't miss the caffiene.
"The sauce was just fine. However, I can't resist flagging a particular piece of idiocy, in the hope that someone might be able to convince Amazon next time. The sauce comes in a pack of 2, but one bottle was broken. Yep, you guessed it, Amazon sent me a new pack of two, and asked me to return the unbroken original. It's only cost me a little time, but how much it's going to cost Amazon to ship and process that returned bottle, your guess is as good as mine. Is it REALLY beyond the bounds of possibility for someone to have split a pack and just sent me the one replacement bottle?"
"I always liked to consider myself a tea drinker, but I really wasn't until I found these tea bags.  Delicious!  I was skeptical at first since Lipton, while a well-known name, doesn't really make artisan teas all that well.  I was so wrong.  The tea is a perfect balance of sweet and savory, with each sip lending itself naturally into the next.  Because it's a white tea, there are very low tannins.  And the tea bags themselves are fun.  These are not your mother's teabags.  Way cool mesh with a pyramid design allows for better steepage (plus it just looks awesome).  I definitely recommend this to anyone, tea lover or not!  It will make you a convert."
"We purchased this product and were greatly disappointed.  The product did not have the texture or the taste that it should have.  We contacted customer service and when they discovered that we were complaining, they suddenly could not understand us and said customer service would contact us.  We never got a call back and could not get in touch with them again.  Very expensive and no quality.  Stay away from this company.  We lived in Spain for years and know what this product should taste like and this was not what it should have tasted like."
"I've tried other Detox teas and this has a weak flavor and color.  Not impressed, will not purchase again."
"Cat grass, also known as wheat grass, is a great plant for anyone. I typically don't do any type of gardening, but I had no trouble getting these seeds to sprout and grow. These seeds make a great project for gardeners, cat lovers, and children, too.<br /><br />The hardest part of caring for these plants is keeping your cats from keeping from devouring them completely! That's what happened to mine, at least, and my cats still -- several months later -- will check the area where I kept the cat grass for more of this tasty plant."
"This is one of the best flavored coffees I have tried,  I usually do not like flavored coffees,  but this one is great, when I serve it  to company they love it."
"My dog usually inhales his food and then gets an upset stomach.  Then, he barfs.  This feeder keeps him busy for 10-15 minutes, which is long enough to prevent the upset stomach.  Two big thumbs up!"
"I tried this, just one can, and am glad I had not bought more.  I do admire the company for coming up with an alternative to typical soft drinks but it's not for me.  I'd describe it as a sickeningly sweet syrup with very little carbonation added.  Plenty of carbonation is essential to a soft drink, it makes it sparkly and refreshing, plus it counteracts the sweetness.  As I said I'm glad it was just one can, my only regret is that I wasted 1.5 ounces of perfectly good vodka trying to make it more palatable and it didn't."
"Quite good tea, never had white tea before, so it took some getting used to. Not my favorite, but its not bad either."
"I really wasn't expecting much. Just something relatively tasty and quick to make. I would normally steer clear of Chef Boyardee but the reviews were good as well as the price so I thought I would take a chance. I have no idea how this could have a 4.5 star rating, and I have to wonder what the culinary standards are across the US.<br /><br />Let's start with the sauce. First of all it's brown, thin, insipid, and lacking any tomato taste. There's some tasteless gristle in there that I guess is supposed to pass as meat. The ravioli themselves have a texture I've never before encounted in pasta. I have no idea how they hold together being that soft. I wasn't expecting al dente, but this is at the other extreme. It's mushy and slimy. It didn't even know there WAS a stage of pasta like this. It has no texture to it at all and becomes a gummy, pasty mess in the mouth. There looks to be generous filling but I have no idea what it's made of. The generous 'meat' filling shown got me to buy it but it has no taste of meat at all.<br /><br />I don't know how any mother with a conscience can feed this to her kids. I don't know how anyone with taste buds can feed this to themselves. There HAS to be better options than this for quick ravioli. There certainly can't be any worse ones!!!"
"I was very diappointed in this product and the company selling this product!<br />First of all shipping of this product was grossly overstated and was not anywhere near its estimated delivery time(product was 3-4 days overdue). Second of all this product was advertised as(HOT & SPICEY)an this is an overstated claim , You can purchase Hotter & Spiceier chips locally that has more KICK than these!<br /><br />I(WOULD NOT) recommend this product or its (shipper) to Anyone!"
"Half way through the supply, I noticed that there were tiny white worms boring through a greenie so I checked the remaining greenies and they also had worms.  Please empty the contents of the box and check the greenies when you receive your order before giving them to your dog.  This may have been an isolated incident but it would only take a few minutes to check the contents for freshness."
"There are a number of different Switch juice flavors.  I tried Kiwi Berry, and I did like it.  There's a whole lot more than Kiwi in this can though, and while they are all natural products (meaning, not man made, I guess) I counted 5 other things besides Kiwi in there, which some of the other reviewers also pointed out.  It is carbonated - which brings out the flavor a bit more, in my opinion. It was sweet, yet they say no sugars are ""added"" (however, the natural products in the concoction already have 33g of sugar in them, in the 8.3 fluid ounce aluminum pop-top can).  There is 135 calories and 34g of carbs in that can too.<br /><br />So, while the flavor is good and I liked the sensation as I drank it, the marketing of the can (tall and narrow, a pretty pink, labeled as 100% of what you want, 0% of what you don't), the can makes me feel like this product is calling out to me saying, ""buy me because I'm a ""premium"" product.""  Well, I'm sorry, that's not why I buy a juice product.  I think the term for this would be ""preppy"" but still, I did taste good."
these smaller marrow bones are great for training and rewards for big dogs.  the regular marrow bones are pretty big.<br />our bernese mountain dogs love these
"Love this blend, so was delighted to find it on your ""Subscribe & Save"" program (at a better price<br />than w/Keurig.  So REALLY disappointed to learn today it was no longer available on said program.<br />Shame on manufacturerer!"
"Just opened Greenies Joint Care (individually sealed) in December 2011 and found small worm crawling all over it.  Next one looked fine, but really supposed to trust these now?"
My daughter loved this stuff. It is all natural and made very well.  Good to mix with other things as they get older too!  Beats Gerber.
"My 50lb bag of oatmeal seemed like way too much, but as time went on I found more and more uses for it. I have so many recipes that I make weekly that I'm running out! This is a very high quality oatmeal and much cheaper and better than anything I've found in the grocery store."
The best wasabi peas hands down.  They are all bright green with the right amount of wasabi.  These guys got it right.
"Sounds corny but oh so true.  The aroma is pungent with the savory smell of coffee and the sweetness of chocolate.  The chocolate flavor is rich yet delicate so it doesn't overwhelm.  I purchased four bags of the ground coffee first for my daughter.  She insisted I taste it even tho I don't like flavored coffee or 'dark' chocolate. I enjoyed it so much I took back a bag and purchased 4 bags of the whole beans to grind when needed for that added freshness.  While I will not drink flavored coffee all the time, I feel it's a treat to start or end my day with a cup of this delicious coffee. My daughter also enjoys this coffee cold."
"In my opinion the best soda cracker on the planet, if you like or love crackers Diamond Bakery makes the tastiest cracker"
WARNING !!!!!  they don't even make there own food it is licensed out to another company if you look on the back of the bag it doesn't even list who it is made by it only says guaranteed by canidae and when i asked who it was made by i was<br /><br />1 either completely ignored<br /><br />2 given a huge run around only thing i ever got was a state it was made in they wouldn't even tell me the company<br /><br />this is dangerous because this is how all the pet food recalls happened a few years ago by out sourcing manufacturing
"If the container wasn't so loud and we could find the correct size/shaped treats to put in it this product would get 5 stars. It keeps our Pit/Lab mix busy and gets her thinking which let me tell you is amazing since she's quite ""thick"" in the head... I've found a few smaller sized treats at Petco and put a handful in at a time. Make sure to put different sized treats in it too or else the dog will dump them all out and then fill up way too fast. The plastic has held up fine on our tile floor except for the teeth marks but I'm not too worried about it breaking like other people have posted."
"First time ordering this jerky from amazon, and I highly recommend to everyone DO NOT BUY IT! It is harder than a rock. I have bought it from other sellers not amazon, and it is much better. The experation date is not for another year, but you cannot even bite it or chew it. Horrible, I think its the worst jerky ive ever bought!"
"We adopted an 8-year-old Dalmatian earlier this year, and heard lots of cautionary tales about special diet. But we couldn't pass up trying a can of this dog food--sadly, just because of the name. Well, she loves it! So now it's her special occasion food. We mix half a can with a cup of dry, 2X/day, with no nasty side effects. She also likes Wingaling and the Napa Valley offerings from this company. It's high in protein and works for us!"
"I received the pant faster than expected, but it was brown and considerably smaller than advertised. I have very little hope that this plant will live out this week, but if it does I will update this review with a higher rating."
"the shipping was great... packaging great and the product, wonderful.  the shipping cost was out of line.  If my order was sent in a USPS flat rate boxes, you can get a much cheaper shipping cost and it is just as fast as UPS.  Especially to Nome, Alaska.  Shippers like UPS because of the ease of them picking up the items to ship but if they did their home work, they would see that the USPS does the same and it is so much cheaper...and to Nome Alaska...faster!<br />Thank you for letting me vent!<br />Patty Andersen<br />A<br />laska resident for 32 years"
My three little dogs love this food and I love it too sense it is organic and has no animal by products.
I bought the 8 oz Black popcorn machine with stand and a box of 24 popcorn packs.  I've used this item dozens of times and just love it.  It works great with the pre mesured packs but also works just as well with store bought oils and popcorn.  We have movie night at least 2 times a month at my house and could not have as much fun with out our machine.  Excelnt product.
Reese changed their Cheesy Popcorn Seasoning.  It is more salt than cheese.  In fact it has very little cheese flavor left.  I will not be purchasing this product again.
"I signed up for the monthly subscription for this item. The price is great especially without having to pay shipping charges. I love the fact that I can manage the subscription by skipping a month or ordering it earlier than scheduled. Amazon has been excellent getting my shipments out on a timely manner. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK33C6"">Newman's Own® Organics Adult Dog Food Chicken & Rice Formula, 7-Pound Bag</a>Very pleased with all my orders from Amazon. Extremely pleased with their customer service! THANKS AMAZON!"
"My husband thought this was alright, but I just couldn't get myself to drink more than a few sips. Let me also add that I am not a soda drinker so this may be a great alternative for someone who is(hence the two stars), but this is an opinion from a non-soda drinker.<br />I had a hard time tasting anything close to Kiwi or berry. It was more cherry or ?? to me. I would've liked a little more fizz to it, I consider it just lightly carbonated. Also, I cannot imagine consuming 33grams of sugar in just over 8oz, it tasted WAY to sweet for me.<br />It kind of bothers me to see 'natural flavors' listed in the ingredients too...like what type of 'natural flavors'??? I would've hoped all the mixed fruit juices would've been enough..."
"I don't know what kind of coffee these people giving this stuff 5 stars were drinking but this coffee honestly tastes like the beans were roasted to the point of charcoal.  Out of 54 people that I work with, only two like it.  I think somebody is getting paid to give this stuff a good review."
"Okay, decent drinking wines are $20 for larger bottles! What gives? And don't tell me it's because it's organic and because it's for Japanese cooking. This is the USA where people cook all kinds of ethnic food and they use lots of mirin, when they can find it. Btw you can find this exact bottle of Eden Mirin for 1/2 this price and free shipping, elsewhere."
"This is my new addiciton.  I would relate this white cheddar flavor to Smart Food's popcorn cheese flavor, which means it is my favorite cheese flavor!  A very full flavor but not too tangy and no real aftertaste like some others."
"I ordered 3 of these for each of my daughters. They are not what is pictured. It actually comes with a cheap adjustable plastic pearl ring and some extra deformed plastic pearl earings. The chain to the necklace is a snake chain and those are great but thats it. One cage would barely open and was bent, another was not going to open at all, the last one opened but the chain was in a knot. Come on... for the price I was not expecting fine jewelry but this was very tacky looking. I would have been embarassed to give this to anyone!!"
"When I got my dog he was 6 and had recently had his teeth cleaned.  Now he is 13 and, with eating a greenie a day, has not needed to have them done again.  He loves these treats!"
I love this popcorn! It makes it so easy to cook the best popcorn every.  I don't think I can ever go back to buying separate stuff and putting it together myself.
These brownies are AMAZING!  Better than most regular brownies I've ever had!  My cousin made them for me when I went to a party at her house.  Everyone was eating them and commenting on how good they were before they knew they were Gluten Free.<br />Try them...you'll like them!
"I learned to drink coffee black and cheap and have never varied much from that.  Strong is fine so long as it isn't bitter.  Complexity is okay if you can find it cheap or if someone else is paying for the cup, but there's no need to get carried away.  It's just coffee.<br /><br />This Melitta brand (Cafe Collection Classique Supreme) is quite smooth and tasty.  If the cost was comparable to the big cans of Chock Full o'Nuts at BJ's I'd happily buy it.  But it just doesn't taste enough better for it to cost much more."
"I have ordered numerous teas, potions, lotions and other remedies...BUT have never had a lack of product in an order that was sealed.  The tea bag wrapping in question was sealed without a tea bag inside.  I would have said something sooner, however...I only tried these when I had a sinus infection and the last 3 times I tried to use one...the sealed pouch was EMPTY.  BEWARE!"
We first received Stonewall pancakes as a gift. We have ordered them 2x on Amazon who has the best prices. Highly recommend this product. Will return here to buy more...
"My daughter has been GF for about 4 years now. We have discovered that if the main ingredient is rice flour, it usually isn't any good. It is usually grainy. This isn't the case with this product. It makes fantastic pancakes (the rest of the family would eat them). She didn't like the biscuits so we won't make those again.  We used it to make corn dogs and the entire family (and a friend) ate them. No one even noticed. Everyone LOVED them.<br /><br />Amazon has since taken this off of the Subscribe and Save. I am so mad. I hope they put it back on soon."
"Have tried many crackers, including some other Dr. Kracker, and think this tastes the BEST.  It's hard/crunchy with lots of seeds on it, so if that's an issue, it might not be for everyone.  Buying it in Amazon's 6-pack makes it less expensive than purchasing in the store."
"I am a long time tea drinker and have tried many brands, but it was on a trip to Scotland that I found the tea of my dreams! I still brew other brands, but this will always be my go-to tea, especially in the afternoons or when I'm stressed out. I also recommend Brodies Scottish Breakfast Tea for those who need to kick-start their day with a stout 'cuppa'. Thank you, Amazon, for carrying this rather obscure brand (in America, anyway) and allowing me to stock up!"
"I have purchased these in the past, but this order tasted a little stale. I have purchased food many times, but this was the first time that I have been disappointed in the quality. I should have returned it."
both the kids and adults loved eating this treat. product tasted great and melted in the mouth. would definitely buy again.
"I m a fan of this soup maker; I have purchased Bear Creek Creamy Potato and Brocolli Cheddar in large cans, each sufficient for 24 servings. Bear Creek shipped them directly to me, but their phone no longer works nor does their email address.They were well priced at 10.00, kept forever, and much could be done to these soups to make a short and simple meal fancy enough for friends. So, as a trial, I ordered this soup-in-a-sack from Amazon. The shipping box had no padding; soup was spilled from a couple of the sacks....and there seems to be teeth marks in the sacks of soup....so,upon openning the package, I immediately,emailed Amazon asking them to get this soup out of my kitchen. They never replied. I do not recommend any Bear Creek in a sack products....not only because of a critter problem but also since they are far more expensive than the large cans."
after trying these chips for the first time I have reordered them several times. other who have tried at my home have ordered them . you won't regret buying them
"First of all, our dog Sheila cannot get enough of these. Seriously, I just got a 10-ounce bag today and she got very greedy after getting a taste. This is a healthy, organic treat that we don't have to feel guilty about feeding (in moderation) to our three year old pointer.<br /><br />My wife and I try to provide good nutrition for our dog. Corn, wheat, and soy are basically useless filler when it comes to dogs. They can't digest it, and furthermore many dogs are allergic to wheat. These Newman's Own Ranch Style treats do not contain any of those ingredients. They also do not contain any artificial additives, not for flavoring or coloring.<br /><br />Also important: these treats are NOT a product of China. I would sooner prepare all my dog's food from scratch than feed her any dog food/treats produced in China. These treats are a product of New Zealand.<br /><br />Grains are not an essential part of a dog's diet, but the one grain included in these treats - organic barley - is (from what I understand) generally an acceptable one. It's the first ingredient, followed by lamb, carrots, apples, palm oil, and molasses. Again, all organic. And that's it - very simple."
This is the best tasting coffee at the most reasonable price for organic! Smooth taste.  Perfect for your morning brew.
This the second time I have ordered this product from Amazon and have been happy with the service received.  I enjoy the cocoa very much.  Drinking a cup of cocoa at bedtime has become a nightly ritual.  I highly recommend this cocoa.
"I never drink this tea alone. I always steep it with another tea, such as Oolong or Jasmine because the taste isn't the best. I use honey and sugar to sweeten and down the hatch it goes! Expect some, um, gastrointestinal responses the next day. Sometimes I feel a bit of cramping and sometimes I don't. Sometimes it will take most of the next day for it to 'work'...and sometimes it won't!!"
I have been using Carbquik for over two years and I absolutely love it. I found a recipe for brownies that called for it and the brownies are moist and delicious. I highly recommend this product for those who watch their carbs and want to make their own low-carbs foods.
"I ordered 2 cases as always. Rvc'd the 2 cases and the crackers were saltless, tastless. Amazon was kind to send 2 more cases and they were the same. BLAH!  I have written the masnufacturer to let them know.<br />Amazon has greta customer care."
Save your money and do not buy this product. Does not even come close to bacon flavor more like a hickory smoke taste. After everyone in my family tried it we all agreed it was nasty(we're not picky either).
"After years of brandy-soaked Twinkies, I just tried one of these tonight.  Wow!  These are good.  My wife was right:  They're good.  But not so good you go crazy and eat the entire box.  It may be the whopping 3 grams of fiber in these tiny little things.  I think it's actually my stomach screaming, ""NO MORE!  I CAN'T TAKE ANY MORE FIBER!  I'M GONNA BLOW!""<br /><br />They remind me of the homemade wholegrain hippy Eucharist from the late 70's and early 80's.  Heavy, moist, whole-grain goodness.  Takes me back to my Catholic school days.  They used to let us kids eat all the leftover homemade wholegrain hippy Jesus after a mass.  Good times."
These are nice little training treat sized cookies that can easily be gobbled by my 50 and 75lb dogs.  I imagine they'd work good too for the smaller dogs as a more regular sized treat.  They are about the size of a nickel each.
"Fed to dog and she got violently sick and vomited the whole this up after eating it. Don't buy this product if you love your pet!!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ANO3N2"">Nylabone Healthy Edibles Bone, Roast Beef Flavored with Vitamins, Regular Size, Triple Pack</a>"
"This is an excellent spicy tea! Ran out and can hardly wait for more.  Was introduced to this by my office mate and have enjoyed it ever since.  This is stronger and quite spicy, in a very good way. Not for the faint of heart though!"
"I'll admit, I am reviewing a product I have not used.  The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as ""gluten intolerance""in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies."
This is an excellent coffee. It has a full flavor but not overpowering.  The Keurig K-cup system is great for single cup use or where one likes to drink various coffees.  Amazon's prices are  very competetive and the shipping is fast.
If your dogs go thru the shakes when you run out like mine do then you need to stock up. The cheapest price you will find delivered to your home. Better deal than you will ever get in a store.
"There is way to much surgar in this hot chocolate it's like having sugar flavored chocolate, I am going to have to buy some pure powedered chocolate and mix it in the bag, other then that I would say it would taste good if it was not so sweet."
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELL9X6"">Numi Organic Tea Chinese Breakfast Yunnan Black Tea, Loose Leaf, 16 oz bag (Pack of 2)</a>I brew iced tea in the refrigerator by the half-gallon with this tea. Excellent. The resealable bags work well, and unopened they protect my large stash, making it easier to manage my subscription."
"This is a good treat for the dogs, they love them.  They have a very cheesy (in a good way) smell that they seem to like.  Only 9 calories a treat, and that allows for a couple treats a day.  The list of ingredients are healthy, mine were marked ""Made with Pride in the USA.""  I'll buy again."
I mix 2 tablespoons a day and smear it on rye toast!.....YUM....just like when I was a kid but this time without all the fat and calories!
This tea is the most awful stuff I've ever put in my mouth.  It has a chemical taste.  I tried adding sugar and it didn't help. I enjoy the Arizona Pomegranate Gree Tea and would highly recomment it.
Always been happy with the quality and price of these treats. Receive them quickly and packaged well.  I would recommend this seller.  Nicely done and no worries.
"The grass sprouted quickly, with a great germination rate. The cats LOVE it, so much that they tried to get to it by knocking it off the mantle while I was out of town. The pot was upside down for at least a day, and it looked like the grass was all going to die. However, a week later it has almost fully recovered, so it's pretty hearty."
"I thought I'd be writing a review raving about this product.  Sadly, I'm not.<br />I would never use it for home use.  It tasted ""muddy"" and bitter. I followed the directions. I even made sure the water was hot but not boiling. I'd probably take it backbacking, but that's it. It's worth a try if you haven't tasted it yet. Read some of the other neutral reviews.  It might help with expectations."
"Rosamonte Especial can never let you down. Tastes fresh and strong. I smell Argentina in every sip. Yerba mate is going through an increase in prices, almost double..crazy. But it's worth the value. I will never change Rosamonte ESPECIAL!"
"I was on the hunt for a Swiss Water Process decaf and happened to come across this low acid variety from HealthWise. I am very, very happy with my choice. I also purchased a Melita decaf as well, and thought it to be too strong. This coffee is as decaffeinated as it gets! No jitters, even on those days I have more than 2 cups. I highly recommend it to any coffee lovers who can no longer enjoy the caffeine and who would like to avoid the chemicals associated with traditional decaf."
"I love the SLAP YA MAMA products and this one was a new one for me.  I loved it and will continue to buy it as needed.  The powder is great, also.  I add it to home made bean soup and lots of other dishes.  Very good products."
"I will first say that I have only tried making pancakes with GF Bisquick. My family's experience with these pancakes, however, was very disappointing, and I will not be trying any other recipe. I have tried Betty Crocker's GF Brownies, and loved them, so when I decided to spend a little extra and try GF Bisquick I was greatly let down by the result. We couldn't even finish them, we just threw them out. If you can tolerate tree nuts and milk products, I recommend trying Pamela's Pancake Mix. Otherwise, if you are looking for great GF pancakes, look elsewhere - GF Bisquick is not worth it, in our opinion."
"Thin, runny, and the fake milk powder used to add ""creaminess"" has an off flavor. Better off eating your ceramic mug."
"As someone who suffers from stomach problems exacerbated (if not caused) by drinking far too much coffee, I had high hopes for this product. Unfortunately, during the two days in which Puroast replaced my usual brew, I noticed no significant changes to my physical or mental states nor any respite from my ailments.<br /><br />So it strikes out as a medicine, but how is it as a beverage? The answer is, at best, nothing special.<br /><br />While billed as a ""dark French roast"", the fine grind of the coffee was more suggestive of espresso, and for best results one should not make espresso in a standard automatic drip coffee pot. The coffee had an acrid aroma and initial taste, which quickly gave way to an empty and hollow flavor, such as one might get when drinking the melted ice from what was once an iced coffee or making instant coffee with cold water. In fairness, my wife liked it more, but she regularly dilutes the coffee that I make... why pay for gourmet when you could just add water?"
Terrible. Half of the rinds don't cook and the ones that do are gummy and shrink. Contacted Lowrey's about the defective product but they failed to respond.
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004K30HO2"">DisposaKups - Disposable K-Cups for Keurig Brewers - 50 Cups, Lids, Filters - 100% Disposable</a><br /><br />I bought these because I occasionally run out of my favorite blend and like the convienience of these over the permanet type filters. I also prefer Decaf Black UNSWEETENED tea for Iced Tea that is unavailable in K-cups.  These are great for both and I am reordering to keep onhand.  Couldn't be happier!"
"I love ThinkThin bars, but just a warning here. There's no clear marking on this flavor to indicate that it contains peanuts. The last ingredient in the fine print is peanut flour and it sent my son into a tailspin. I'm a very careful consumer on that front and ultimately, I should have known, but their other non-peanut butter flavors are just fine. So heads up."
"I bought these thinking they were individually wrapped.  Should have taken more time to look at the reviews and the user submitted pictures.  The beef sticks taste alright, but I find myself not wanting to eat them because they are so inconveniently packaged.  I would need to use a clip to reseal the bulk package after one or two beef sticks.  A lot of the reviews mention that they aren't individually wrapped, but don't really make a big deal about it.  When I want a quick snack I don't want to go grab a utensil or a napkin just for a beef stick.  Maybe if I was dying of hunger, I would grab them by the handful and swallow them whole."
"I have made Iced Chai Lattes with this mix for about five people now and they all LOVE it.  There are instructions on the side of the container that tell you how to do it.  It's very simple.  My only suggestions is this:  When it says to use 1 and 1/3 cups of powder, only use 1 cup.  It can be too sweet if you use the amounts they tell you to use."
"I've sampled several varieties of Eden Organic beans; this is the only one which i found to taste truly awful.  Of course taste is subjective, so your mileage may vary.  My advice, before committing to a case purchase, is to first sample this variety by buying a single can from a local store.  If that's not an option for you, then you might consider moving on to another variety.  I can recommend their black, pinto, and great northern beans.  If you're looking for something out of the ordinary, you might consider their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HDMUOE"">Aduki Beans</a>.<br /><br />I like the fact that all Eden Organic beans are in BPA free cans.  Too bad that not all their canned products are BPA free (e.g. as of this writing, Eden canned tomatoes, soups, etc. have BPA linings)."
I was not thrilled by the taste of this coffee. It was a little too weak for me. I will try the bolder kind next time. This one just tasted to watered down
"Although the cereal is a great tasting cereal I gave this one star because the price of $41.50 that they are selling it for here on Amazon is rediculous!!! That's almost $7 a box. I don't know about you but I know I've never paid $7 for a box of cereal. Wal-Mart sells the 21 oz. (6 pack) of Life Cinnamon cereal for $19.68. Just make sure you shop around because when you see a deal that you think may be to good to be true, it probably is NOT a good deal."
"It is not the best way to buy Beer Nuts.<br /><br />Perhaps the product had been exposed to high heat and a ""whole lot of shaking"".  Most of the ""coating"" and ""flavoring"" was off of the nuts.  Even though the individual cans are ""sealed"", it is like the nuts had been sitting out in a bowl for a long time on a hot, humid day."
My little girl will ask for these crackers day and night.  Bought a pkg of 6 and have used up 4 real quick.  I will be back for more very soon.
The bread has a good taste but does not rise properly and only makes 1/2 loaf.  I checked the temp of the water as suggested with bad results.  After raising the temp to 100 degrees I got it to rise to 3/4 loaf.  Pretty expensive for the quality and I won't buy again.
"I love this product. I wanted something healthy and good tasting that didn't have added sugar or chemical sweeteners as an alternate to water. This is it. I like this coconut water better than others I have tried. It isn't as sweet as the Amy & Brian brand, which I prefer. I do not use sugar so I found this brand to be the best. The taste has also been consistent since starting my use of this in April. I have purchased four cases since June 2012. It also has a lot of health benefits."
"Do not waste your money on this. I waited anxiously for the mail to deliver. Made a fresh 12 oz cup of coffee, dropped in two tablets. Nothing. I dropped in two more. Changed the flavor of the black coffee, but not for the better. I had wanted this so I didn't have to use cream for flavor with all the calories. Not even a hint of CHOCOLATE flavor."
This product tastes like muddy water maybe because it is out of date!?!  I don't know but I'll not buy this again.
"When it's time for my evening meal, I often enjoy these tasty dry grains. This specialized indoor formula, made just for me because I am the most important being on earth, keeps me fit and healthy by reducing my fat intake. If I'm awake when Nathan get's home, I come rocketing into the kitchen to get my scoop of Purina Cat Chow. Sometimes I'm so hungry I can't contain myself and eat my food in a manner that is, uh, well let's just say it's not always dignified.<br /><br />Sometimes I wish that there were a few more pounds of food in that bag, as I have to send Nathan out to get me more on bi-weekly basis. That's ok though, as he is here to serve me. I've been pestering him to write this review for a while now, and it's good to know that other supreme beings like myself might benefit from my thoughts.<br /><br />If you, like me, enjoy these tasty grains, you might also like to try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009JUPOS"">Fancy Feast Gourmet Gold Savory Chicken and Turkey Formula</a>.<br /><br />Oliver<br />Expert Cat Food Reviewer"
"My Italian grandmother got me hooked on Lipton Loose Tea as a child. Tea is important to me- I never have gotten into coffee.  It has been increasingly more difficult to find Lipton Loose in supermarkets, so I have tried to find something to replace it- more expensive, ""fancier"" teas just aren't as good.  This is a great product- sooo much better than tea bags.  We like it hot &/or iced.  People always ask me ""What kind of tea is this?"" and then are so surprised to find out that it is good old reliable Lipton.  Tea lovers- don't be snobs!  Give Lipton Loose Tea a try.  Thanks Amazon for carrying this product!"
"RECONSIDER THIS FORMULA!!<br /><br />Martek advertises this formula on their website!<br /><br />""Although Martek told the board that they would discontinue the use of the controversial neurotoxic solvent n-hexane for DHA/ARA processing, they did not disclose what other synthetic solvents would be substituted. Federal organic standards prohibit the use of all synthetic/petrochemical solvents"".<br /><br />Martek Biosciences was able to dodge the ban on hexane-extraction by claiming USDA does not consider omega-3 and omega-6 fats to be ""agricultural ingredients."" Therefore, they argue, the ban against hexane extraction does not apply. The USDA helped them out by classifying those oils as ""necessary vitamins and minerals,"" which are exempt from the hexane ban. But hexane-extraction is just the tip of the iceberg. Other questionable manufacturing practices and misleading statements by Martek included:<br /><br />Undisclosed synthetic ingredients, prohibited for use in organics (including the sugar alcohol mannitol, modified starch, glucose syrup solids, and ""other"" undisclosed ingredients)<br />Microencapsulation of the powder and nanotechnology, which are prohibited under organic laws<br />Use of volatile synthetic solvents, besides hexane (such as isopropyl alcohol)<br />Recombinant DNA techniques and other forms of genetic modification of organisms; mutagenesis; use of GMO corn as a fermentation medium<br />Heavily processed ingredients that are far from ""natural""<br /><br />quote from: Why is this Organic Food Stuffed With Toxic Solvents? by Dr. Mercola - GOOGLE GMOs found in Martek.<br /><br />This is the latest I have found on DHA in organic and non organic baby food/ formula:<br />AT LEAST READ THIS ONE*** GOOGLE- False Claims That DHA in Organic and Non-Organic Infant Formula Is Safe. AND OrganicconsumersDOTorg<br /><br />Martek's patents for Life'sDHA states: ""includes mutant organisms"" and ""recombinant organisms"", (a.k.a. GMOs!) The patents explain that the oil is ""extracted readily with an effective amount of solvent ... a preferred solvent is hexane.""<br /><br />The patent for Life'sARA states: ""genetically-engineering microorganisms to produce increased amounts of arachidonic acid"" and ""extraction with solvents such as ... hexane."" Martek has many other patents for DHA and ARA. All of them include GMOs. GMOs and volatile synthetic solvents like hexane aren't allowed in USDA Organic products and ingredients.<br /><br />Tragically, Martek's Life'sDHA is already in hundreds of products, many of them certified USDA Organic. Please demand that the National Organic Standards Board reject Martek's petition, and that the USDA National Organic Program inform the company that the illegal 2006 approval is rescinded and that their GMO, hexane-extracted Life'sDHA and Life'sARA are no longer allowed in organic products.<br /><br />BUT I went to the lifesdha website and THEY DO NOT DISCLOSE HOW THEY MAKE THEIR LifesDHA!!! I have contacted the company to see what they say.<br /><br />Also these are the corporate practices of Martek which are damaging to the environment as well written just last Dec 2011 at NaturalnewsDOTcom<br /><br />The best bet is to just avoid the lifeDHA at this time in my opinion b/c corporate america cares more about the almighty $ than your health."
I'm currently eating a very low carb diet.  When I saw the Mio energy product I was excited to try it.  That was until I first tasted it.  This stuff is awful.  I powered on after first taste and received no energy boost from this mix.  I will not use again.
"Moderately flavorful with no trace of bitterness. Low acidity, nice aroma. I had to use significantly more per pot than the package specifies, but that is usually the case with my Cuisinart drip coffee maker."
This is not for me. It was like eating a bowl of fat. Not my preference. Everyone is different. Personally i dont like this at all.
"SORRY, AS I STATED ON MY OTHER REVIEWS MY GERMAN BREED, G.SHEPH. IS VERY PICKY...AND HE JUST DID NOT CARE FOR THE SMELL OF THESE BEEF ROLLS, HE DID NOT EVEN CARE TO COME CLOSE TO TAKE 2ND SNIFF....SORRY, NO STAR!!! BUT IT TRIGGERED ME TO GIVE IT AS LEAST 1 STAR TO CONTINUE MY REVIEW."
The original flavor would work fine with any dip and are okay on their own<br />The salt and pepper flavor is AWESOME.  Really tasty and a great snack for only 100 calories<br />The sour cream and onion is a little chemicall-y but decent.<br />The barbeque is good but not tasty enough.  The flavor doesn't go as well with the texture.<br /><br />Haven't yet tried the other two flavors.  Will update as I do.<br /><br />If you haven't tried popchips they are sort of a cross between pringles and rice cakes.  Less like styrofoam than rice cakes and made with the same potato flakes kind of texture as pringles without as much fat.<br /><br />So far I have this on subscribe and save and will keep that subscription active.  These definitely beat a 150 - 300 calorie bag of potato chips as a snack.
"By accident, I stumbled on this product a few months ago.  Absolutely love the Popchips BBQ Potato Chips.  I've tried ALL the flavors, but BBQ is my favorite.  I'm on Weight Watchers, and this is a great alternative to regular chips...and I don't feel one bit guilty after eating a bag!  I get the individual sized bags by the case...so they're always available.  Can't find them locally, but Amazon.com is the next best thing!"
I really enjoy this one and I've tried many! In my top 5. A little pricey but will order again sometime in the future.
"Poor product.<br /><br />What was I thinking, looking for mail-order seafood at Amazon.<br /><br />Buy locally!"
"I purchased these for my dog and my sisters 2.  They are all large dogs (46 lbs. and up)  Until these they were running around, getting in each others face - JUST DOING WHAT DOGS DO.  I gave them the ""EVERLASTING TREAT'  and they went to seperate places and did not move for over an hour.<br /><br />There is only one thing - with these dogs - NOTHING IS EVERLASTING.  They loved them and I will definitely buy more.<br /><br />As usual - You can go wrong - when you go AMAZON"
As hard as I tried I just couldn't smell that french vanilla aroma.Next time I'll stick to Lipton. Definitely not a good buy.
"I've been a connoisseur of fine tea for many years.  Yet, I can no longer afford to frequent the fine tea rooms and tea stores that I used to, which offered my favorite varieties and international brands.  Subsequently, I've had to settle for lessor quality brands sold in most major supermarkets.<br /><br />Knowing how much I enjoy superior tea, my daughter-in-law chose Bentley's Finest Royal Green Tea Collection Gift Set as a holiday gift.  I could not have been more pleased!  *I regret that I delayed writing this review. Yet, with Mother's Day approaching, I'm hoping for another gift set.<br /><br />Bentley's Royal Green Tea is a superb collection of fine tea which is equal in quality and taste to some of the world's best green tea I've enjoyed.  This elegantly wrapped gift-set offers 6 varieties of special blends of green tea and fruit blends, from exotic fruits to popular favorites, such as Mango or Raspberry.<br /><br />Each teabag is securely sealed in a beautifully designed packet, with an elegant artistic image representing the fruit which flavors that teabag.  Bentley's goes further by providing a sturdy wood-like case, designed with 6 separate sections, each section containing 6 teabags of one flavor.  This solid well-designed dark-green case holds a total of 36 individually wrapped tea bags in its six compartments; a case which aptly resembles a jewelry box for the true 'jewels' of exquisite fine teabags it holds.  Indeed, when you lift the firm lid on this elegant case of fine tea, you will know you have a treasure-chest of great varieties of fine green tea.<br /><br />I was especially impressed that each teabag was expertly measured and prepared to effect the perfect aroma and optimal taste for the average teacup.  No other green teabags comes close to the perfect brew one would expect from the finest loose tea sold in specialty tea stores and tea rooms.<br /><br />Whether you purchase Bentley's Finest Royal Green Tea Collection Gift Set as a gift, or for your personal use, you will not be disappointed by the suburb quality of this wonderful selection of fruit-flavored green tea.<br /><br />Maizie Lucille James<br />April 2, 2012"
"This is my 3 year old son's favorite type of oatmeal. We have tried many others but he likes this one best. He gets very insistent that I put honey on top of his oatmeal, so I like the fact that this instant stuff has a little bit less sugar on it than it used to have. I love how easy it is to make, and it is great that my son can help me make it in the morning. In addition to the honey, we also usually add a couple heaping tablespoons of yogurt to it, so that it cools down faster."
"The units go together easily, but no matter how much or little coffee I put in the filter, it caused overflow. It's as if the filters are too thick. I also had a few cups that didn't pierce correctly.  Definitely not worth the money for these!"
This is the second time that I ordered this product and I've been very happy with it.
"bought this 5 hour energy knockoff at local grocery shop. I couldn't have more than 3 sips of the orange flavor, had to dilute with mountain dew, but even then it was bad. Few days later, I tried this grape flavor to help me with an all-nighter. I had one sip and I almost threw up. I'm not lying! This is a horrible drink and should not be consumed. I never created a review, and i shop a lot here, but this one of those times that you strongly feel about something (either real good, or real bad) Do yourself a favor, buy just one can to try for yourself. Obviously the previous review is by the manufacturer."
I love this coffee it's my favorite so far I want to try them all. I don't like strong coffee and I hate bitter after taste coffee to me this is the perfect cup  of coffee. I'm not telling everyone to go out and buy it this is my own opinion.
I would rate Starbucks ready brew coffee quite high.  They are very easy to use and I like the flavor a lot.  I use them at work where I only want one cup of coffee and hate to have to use and wash my whole coffee pot.
"I pack a box of these sardines, best ones ever, with a diabetic candy bar for lunch & I'm set for the day, lunch at work under $2.00"
"Mama Grain and Amaranth Ratatouille from Happy Baby have been long-time favorites since my son was about 10 months old. Even now he is a toddler, he still eats Mama Grain on occasion - it's good to take with us if we're eating out and he's being picky about what's available. It's thick and filling enough to supplement his meal. It has a sweetness from the bananas, obviously, but the black beans and the quinoa grain also help making it more lasting. So full of goodness! I agree the taste seems a little weird at first to us adults, but I actually like that's a different flavor - help to keep his taste buds open to different tastes, hopefully..."
I like everything except for weak aroma.  I don't know why.  It just doesn't have nearly as much nice coffee smell as the other ones. Aroma is one of the things I enjoy when I make expresso.  This is why I gave 4 star.
"This is simply a mix of brown sugar and Splenda, I am sure it would be cheaper to make your own"
"Popchips are great - so flavorful and better for you than regular chips.  I ordered the pack of (12) 3 oz (full size - same as in the grocery store) bags.  Below are the flavors I received:<br />- Barbecue (2 bags)<br />- Original (1 bag)<br />- Thai Sweet Chili (1 bag)<br />- Parmesan Garlic (1 bag)<br />- Jalapeno (1 bag)<br />- Cheddar (1 bag)<br />- Sweet Potato (1 bag)<br />- Sea Salt & Vinegar (1 bag)<br />- Salt & Pepper (1 bag)<br />- Chili Lime (1 bag)<br />- Sour Cream & Onion (1 bag)<br /><br />As far as ordering the (12) 3oz bags vs the (24) 0.8 oz bags, per ounce it is cheaper to get the 3oz bags and divide them into individual servings yourself.  The 0.8oz bags are more convenient, though, so it just depends on what you're going for!"
"These DisposaKups are ""the cats meow"" they serve the purpose thy were intended for very well and were delivered as promised on time and well packaged arrived in good condition I would recommend to all friends."
This is a good product.  The price at Amazon is excellent and I really like it just coming to my door.  Subscribe and save is an excellent way to shop
"Ordered a 12 pack of 15 ounce cans of pumpkin.  Received the order and about 10 of the cans were dented or bent (some severely).  The cans were obviously not bent or damaged in shipping.  The cans were crated, wrapped in bubble wrap, and packed in an undamaged Amazon shipping box.  It was as if someone picked through the cans and packed dented and bent cans.  I considered returning the order but needed it right away.  I use the pumpkin to moisten dry food for my dog which eats special food for severe allergies.  The pumpkin was fine but the impression created by the vendor with the condition of the cans was not acceptable.  I do not intend to order from this vendor again."
"I got this thinking that it would be a great organic treat for my Lab/Rhodesdian Ridgeback mix puppy. I figured giving him a treat like this would really satisfy his chewing instinct. This treat is VERY hard. It comes in a rectangle shape that is divided in half and I tried to break it into two smaller treats and had a difficult time. My dog did not like the flavor either. He preferred to play with these rather than eat them. Usually he will eat a treat in about a minute but this treat stayed in his cage with him picking it up and dropping it for hours. He has very powerful jaws and he usually tears up most of his toys in a day or two, yet he did not wont to eat these very much. Whatever they put in this is not very appealing to dogs apparently.<br /><br />Your dogs may like this better (hopefully). Again this is a VERY hard threat so make sure your dogs don' t mind having to gnaw at it for awhile. Also, if your dog acts like it doesn't like it then it probably never will, so give the pooch a different treat."
"I will admit, the Icicle does allow you to plug any mic with an XLR jack to your computer using a USB jack. It does indeed provide phantom power to condenser mics and it will deliver a signal to your recording software.<br /><br />Beyond that, the usefulness depends on your mic and what you consider an acceptable recording level.<br /><br />I tried this with an AKG 200, BLUE enCORE 200 and an AKG 4500. All deliver very nice sound when used in a conventional recording chain. I could barely get an audible record level yelling into the enCORE 200, my staple for location voice recording. Normally, I plug the enCORE directly into a digital audio recorder with an XLR cable. No mic preamp, no phantom power, no EQ, and I get a good clean clear sound level near the peak of input level.<br /><br />This is one very disappointing product. If you route your mic through a preamp, then put the Icicle between the preamp and the USB input of your computer, you can get a decent record level, but that extra equipment is what this light weight gadget is supposed to avoid. Personally, I think you might be better off getting a decent channel strip* or mic preamp and an XLR to to mini jack to go between the channel strip and your computer input and forget the Icicle altogether.<br /><br />BLUE makes some great products, but this is not one of their better ones.<br /><br />*For those that don't know, Channel Strips combine several pieces of equipment into one box: typically a mic preamp and a compressor. Higher end units add some EQ capability as well or have other options."
the tea seemed fine but the fragrance oils were too strong for my taste.  i could not taste the tea.  they need to be more subtle with a green tea.  too bad because i am really looking for a good one to replicate the one i usually drink from france which i cannot get any longer.
"If you like mild sprouts, like alfalfa, you might not like this.  The Radish and Broccoli sprouts taste similar to their adult counterparts and pretty much rule the taste of the mix.  Personally, I like it, but my wife was disgusted.  To each their own, I say...  Just be forewarned.<br /><br />Also, start small!  These produce a LOT of sprouts.  I started with about a tablespoon and that was plenty for the grower I used."
"Being a fan of La Preferida pickled Jalapenos I was quite shocked when I received this product.  It has many other ingredients such as:<br /><br />Carrots (Big coins of them)<br />Onion<br />Garlic<br />Oregano<br />Soya Oil<br />Turmeric<br /><br />I'm not sure who uses Jalapenos like this, but they were not what I was expecting at all.  There is no indication from the product listing that I can see that shows the ingredients to give you a heads up.  I'm very disappointed."
"Well what a surprise!  This stuff is really quite easy and good.  I used my vitamix to make the dough and it was a bit too much for it (sticky) - unfortunately hand blended is easier on kitchen equipment.  But you don't have to worry about handling the dough too much.  The thinner the end product the better it cooks inside. My current fav is a mini french bread loaf.  Crispy outside and slightly 'holey' inside. I made cheese bread sticks in with the plain mix and kneeding shredded cheese into it.  There is a slight odd, but not objectionable, taste which dipping in chili or smearing with butter covers up.  Next project - PIZZA!!!!!"
"This is a product that is delicious and easy to use. I made the pancakes with buttermilk and the recipe on the box just said milk. The buttermilk helped make the pancakes light and fluffy. I am a little disappointed that the box will only make one recipe that calls for two cups of the mix. I doubled my recipe for the pancakes which made 14<br />4 inch pancakes.  The recipe says it makes 10 pancakes with 1 cup of the mix. Those 10 pancakes must be silver dollar size.  I am looking forward to making the biscuits so I will have to open a second box to have enough mix. The recipe calls for eggs for biscuits and I never used eggs in my regular biscuits.  I am wondering if buttermilk would make these biscuits rise sufficiently? I have family members who can't eat eggs or milk so I must adapt recipes for them. It is a product I would purchase again. However, I used Subscribe and Save on Amazon and the time to receive the product was really long in my opinion--ordered Nov. 19th received Dec. 2nd. I know Thanksgiving was in the midst of that time period but I thought I would have received the product before Thanksgiving. I will try Subscribe & Save one more time to see if all things are so slow.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004391DK0"">Bisquick Pancake and Baking Mix, Gluten-Free, 16-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 3)</a>"
"It's tasty although they say ""a medley of oranges mingled with piquant leaves."" I also enjoy it because it's caffeine free, good for chilly nights."
I like the fact that this vanilla flavor has no alcohol in it so i could add it to my baby's pancakes.  It does not taste the same to me as the regular stuff.  It is rather bland in my opinion.
"No flowery notes, thank god!  This is the most perfect k-cup coffee I've tried.. It's my trusty ol faithful ""go-back-to"" coffee when I veer off and try another brand.  If you want a solid yummy true bold but not bitter cup of joe get this, u won't be sorry. It is yummy black or with creamer...! Leaves a true good coffee after taste and is AMAZING with dessert."
"If you want to serve a tasty rice, this is the one.  It is healthy wholesome rice compared to a mix style box that adds lots of sodium.<br /><br />Recommend to anyone to create a restaurant style quality to your meal.<br /><br />It take 45 minutes to cook, so I start it first thing on the stove and prepare the rest of the entrees of the meal.<br /><br />Amazon also offer this rice at a very good price compare to my local grocery store.  Thank you for an affordable price."
"I know it will be a good day when I start off my day with dessert!  I am a real tea drinker, and I love this tea.  It is really like having a warm cup of vanilla cake.  It is a great way to start off your day!  Amazon does a great job delivering it right to my front door."
"Sue, I think you got a bad batch, these are awesome! I have ordered them three times now and each time they have been soft, tasty, and easily slide out of the bags. I sincerely think you got a bum pack. I have tried a couple of other flavors too but prefer this one over the others. The cookies are healthy and fast and most of all, taste great."
Carbquik Baking Mix has been a blessing for me.  Having pancakes and waffles again is wonderful after becomeing a diabetic.  I use Walden Farms Pancake Syrup which is wonderful. I have bought this four times and will buy again.
"I will not buy this again. This tasted more like milk chocolate than dark chocolate to me. It was way to sweet! It is not ""quality"" chocolate in my opinion. It tasted like that cheap chocolate they put in those colorful dots that come thin plastic holders. Actually, I prefer that chocolate to this. If you are looking for real dark chocolate this is not for you."
I purchased a sample pack at christmas time and it was excellent.  This coffee is full of flavor and as a added bonus you can smell the rasberry while it is brewing.
"...and you'll have a pretty good idea what this tastes like. The tangerine (and/or the added flavoring) provides a nice 'tang' to the flavor. I found it to be quite tasty and refreshing.  I'm not sure why they are packaging it in the small 8.3 oz ""energy drink""-size cans, unless it's to keep the calories per serving down. At 140 cal.can, it certainly isn't low-cal, but there is no added HFCS (high fructose corn syrup) or sugar. The surprisingly high price is also a downside. True, real juice is a lot more expensive than water and HFCS, but at this price, I'll give it a pass.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Good taste, not too carbonated<br /><br />Cons:<br />Small can, expensive, fairly high calorie/oz"
"I was looking for a low calorie cocktail and mixed a Rose wine with the Fresca Peach and it was delicious and I am not a regualar soda drinker and don't normally drink Rose wine. Make sure to get a Rose that is not sweet or you might as well drink Kool-aid. Look for off-dry or bone dry Rose's, maybe made with a Syrah, Cabernet, Merlot, Tempranillo, Sangiovese. Zinfandels tend to be too sweet for my taste, but you might like it. A sparkling rose would be great too. You can serve this with ice in a cocktail glass  or without ice in a martini glass."
I bought this coffee for my Keurig coffee maker and I really like it. Smooth  and the best thing it is an organic. Wolfgang uses the the best beans for his coffee's. Buy you will be pleasantly surprised.
"I have a big sweet tooth and thought I would really like this, but it was too sweet even for me. I even tried adding water, but that didn't help. I haven't tried any of the other flavors, so I can't comment on the brand in general, but I'll never try this flavor again."
"It is a medium roast pleasant coffee, comparable to green mountain's breakfast blend. I bought it with a very good deal though."
"Top quality, fast shipping and secure packaging. Great product to use as a sweetener in drinks, coffee, tea, etc. have ordered in the past and will definitely order again."
I ORDERED KETTLE CHIPS IN THE FOLLOWING FLAVVORS<br />SALT & FRESH GROUND PEPPER<br />TUSCAN 3 CHEESE<br />N.Y. CHEDDAR AND HERS<br /><br />THEY ALL TASTED THE SAME TO ME.  IF THERE IS A VARIETY PACK SUGGEST U ORDER BEFORE ORDERING LARGE SIZE.<br /><br />I WISH I COULD RETURN THE UNOPENED BAGS.
"My dog Sawyer even as a puppy took right to it.  He drains it pretty quickly, but we fill it with kibble thats different than his standard so its not too many treats.  Its fun to watch him play with it as well, since you can see him focus and think about it.  I recommend this to someone with a puppy that loves to think and do things."
"The coffee is good. However, at least half of these haven't been sealed correctly. When I brew them the edge of the foil pops open and coffee grounds go everywhere. Not fun to clean. It may have just been the batch we got, but I won't be ordering these again."
This product sounded great.  I ordered a box and really could only eat one.  I took the box into work and found that my opinion was shared.  They just tasted empty of flavor.  very disappointing.
"This is the ONLY dog treat that my Lhasa Apso will eat. It makes me happ becuase it has NO added ingredients or preservatives, as well as NO ADDED SALT! This is the ONLY dog treat that my Vet approves of!"
"A co-worker of mine went to Jamaica for vacation in Feb. and bought me a 1lb. bag of the ground.  It's expiration date was March.  I brewed it as soon as I got home.  To me it tasted like cheap coffee that had been left out in the open air for a week.  I wonder if it was due to the expiration date, or does this coffee really taste like this.  If so, I will never buy again.  From all the hype, I was expecting much more."
"The written description of this tea was good enough to get me to put it on my wish list this xmas. My wife prefers the sweeter fruitier teas, such as Republic of Tea's Kiwi Pear, and I generally go for traditional blacks, Prince of Wales, Oolongs, etc. But this tea is perfect for both of us! I always liked good vanilla teas, and some coconut teas always blew me away as well. Our pals at Steep Tea still make some of the best teas in around, so we were pretty game to try this Lana's tea - it always feels good to try out teas by the 'small guys'.<br /><br />Anyway, there was this unbelievably great aroma to this tea that we couldn't pin down until one of our pals pointed out ""This smells like Bailey's!"" Bingo. Need I go on?"
"We are white popcorn enthusiasts, and were very pleased with this product.  Large, tender kernels of poped corn.  Used an electric, self stirring poper.  Worth the cost."
Perfect for a stress free afternoon. The aroma from this tea makes the house smell great. Drink this with Grade-A honey and its bliss.
"Interesting, a must try.  Good and cool and great to share with someone you like/love.  Kids want their own!!"
"These have an artificial sweetener aftertaste. Not pleasant. I would not purchase them again. This the first Kcup hot chocolate I've tried, I'll keep looking."
I have ordered this popcorn 3 times now.  It is just like being at the movies!  We don't get to go because we have small children so we make our home a theater.  This popcorn is absolutely the best!  I like it better than the movie popcorn!  Every pack is awesome!  People come over and can't believe how good it taste!  This is a must buy!!
"These beans are trully wonderful and wonderfully priced. Split a few down the length toss in a bottle of Vodka or Rum or some Bourbon for a few days and you have a wonderfull drink. Great for baking , make truly amazing vanilia bean cookies."
"So, I sampled this SWITCH Orange/ Tangerine Blend. Low on the Carbonation, high on the Orange taste, and worth every sip in Gold! Plus, healthy to boot...Give it a try, and you may discard those ""Brand Names"" once and for all!"
"I don't know if I got a bad batch or something, but I could'nt get these to cook right. I followed the instructions and after about two minutes, the bag stoped expanding. I opened it and found everything badly burnt. the next bag I waited about one and a half minutes. I opened it and found half the chips uncooked. I never could find a time that either left some uncooked or some burnt. (I shook the bags and scattered the chips inside them well before microwaving each time)"
I used this product on a cake topper for a wedding cake that I made. It worked out so well. Bride & groom were very happy and got non-stop compliments!!
"I love the taste of this popcorn! I actually like the fact that it's smaller pieces. The middle hull part is still too tough for my poor jaw. I don't know if this would be different if I cooked it in oil, I've only used the air popper."
"OK, so I went ahead and bought a 24 pack even though it had an aweful review.  ""How Bad could it be?""  Well not so bad that I'm going to waste it but I doubt that I'll be re-ordering.<br /><br />**** UPDATE: I've finished most of it and it does grow on you.  GET OVER THAT IT REALLY DOESN""T TASTE LIKE ROOT BEER and it's OK.  Probably still won't re-order but will try their Cream Soda."
"I have tasted many packages of brownie mix, most of them contain hydrogenated oils, propylene glycol, and lots of other nasty ingredients. These brownies are by far the best tasting, with all pure ingredients. I love to bake a batch, cut them into small squares, and put them in the freezer for a great treat. Anyone sensitive to wheat will absolutely LOVE these brownies. You won't be disappointed! Great with walnuts too."
"I first tried these at a friend's house, and from that day forward I was hooked! These little clusters are sweet, salty, crunchy goodness. They make a great on-the-go snack that is both filling and needs no refrigeration. Wish I could rate them more than 5 stars!"
"I thought it had a bitter orange flavor, however my husband and friend liked it."
These were fair.  I don't feel they are AA quality.  Would not repurchase.
Ive tried other scented coconut oils as opposed to natural edible versions to remind me of the beaches of Hawaii.. and this truly has the closest scent to me.<br />Hydrating and just a little bit mixed with water after a shower. Super replenishing!
THIS HAS BEEN MY FAVORITE COFFEE SINCE DAY ONE OF HAVING MY KEURIG. YOU CAN'T MESS IT UP. EVERY CUP IS PERFECT.
"Refreshing taste love the decaf, because I can have some before bed, still resting well, quick delivery. Twining's is a good brand, it doesn't taste like your drinking tea dust in the bags"
"My otherwise healthy Papillon was doing great before feeding these to him.  He is normally pretty fussy about which treats he likes, so when I found these I thought I had hit a gold mine.  However, over time, I saw behavior changes (a normally laid back dog getting first hyper, then lethargic).  I took him to the vet and they saw that his liver and kidneys were being compromised in his lab work.  That's when I started looking into everything he was eating, and noticed that these are made in China.  I did not check for this initially because I purchased them at Whole Foods, and WF has guidelines before a food can get on the shelves.  I am concerned that while these treats may not have caused death, they are having an adverse effect on some pets.<br /><br />Three weeks after I took him off these this food, his lab values returned to normal.<br /><br />I noticed several other reviews here from pet owners with similar issues to mine.  I am giving them 1 star, because there is no button for 0 stars."
"These K-Cups are great! The coffee is mild and yummy, but still very flavorful. I love this, cant wait to get my next shipment!"
"Why, why, why did they change the formula??  Our twins loved this.  Now just like gobble gobble, they wont take it.<br /><br />Company's website with the old and new formula: [..]<br /><br />Only guess is that sweet potato is much more expensive than corn (both the top ingredients).<br /><br />Wrote to happybaby to tell them how disappointed we are"
"Makes OKAY pancakes. Only marginally better than the standard Bisquick recipe. They are edible (I should say that my kids liked them).<br /><br />Not that great, in my opinion."
"I'm usually into Pineapple and coconut drinks, but this drink just didn't taste all that great to me. The taste doesn't resemble anything close to a 'Pina Colada' flavor and it was actually difficult to taste the pineapple or coconut in it.  It just tastes tangy and a little sour... like water that has a bit of sugar and sour-ness to it. Yeah, not really a taste I crave. I'm not sure if everyone had this reaction to this drink, but it just didn't appeal to me. I really wanted to like it though, because as I said before... I usually love pineapple coconut drinks."
"Quick, easy, order and shipping. Wonderful product for those of us that need gluten free foods. Even my friends and family love these brownies. Those I haven't told don't know the difference. Easy to add lots of nuts and other things. YUM!"
"I was skeptical when I tried this, but boy what a delight.  The flavor is deep but not too heavy, and the carbonation is just right; it doesn't get in the way of enjoying the juice.  It actually has a good ""mouth-feel"" - I drank it 15 minutes ago, and I can still feel a little hint of it.  It's like I had a thin slice of fresh kiwi and strawberry melting in my mouth."
"I cannot give high enough praise for these incredibly delicious and protein packed little snacks. Even my very food fussy 5 year old likes them. They are the perfect light lunch or snack to throw in your purse for a busy afternoon. The flavour is delicious, sweet and smokey. At under 100 calories and packed with 10 grams of protein, you can't go wrong. I HIGHLY recommend these snacks, they are worth every penny."
This is good iced tea.  It is hard to find locally in the Fall and Winter.
"This one has a major problem. It's waaaay too watery, even at the recommended settings. The chocolate flavor is okay, and it's not overly sweet (although it still isn't great dark chocolate flavor). The really issue is that there isn't any creaminess, and adding milk only dilutes the flavor even more. Blech! I'll pass, and I'm throwing the rest of the box out."
"I used Super Gold Luster Dust to create the most exquisite chocolate aspen leaves for the groom's cake at my son's wedding. By using an artist's paintbrush to lightly coat the molded leaves with Luster Dust, the result was startlingly beautiful. In contrast to food coloring, the Luster Dust brushes on easily and imparts a realistically metallic color and sheen. The containers are small but the product goes a long way, making it extremely economical to use. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1933981350"">The Step Dynamic: A Powerful Strategy for Successfully Growing Your Business</a>"
"This product seems to be torturous for my dog.  She sees the treats inside, but being such a small dog, even the ""small"" sized bottle is too big for her to thrash around and get the treats out. I love how busy it keeps her, but in the end, I have to take a treat or two out for her because she can't do it on her own.  Probably better for bigger dogs."
"For a bit, Amazon improved the packaging on these delightful biscuits. Now they are back to their slacker ways and every single packet is broken and crumbly.<br /><br />Shame on you Amazon!"
"My goldendoodle is picky and likes to change up his food once in a while. So I decided to try two other brands....what a mistake.<br /> Newman's own is really the best: my dog looks better, feels better, and the quality of food is very good. Do not do like I did and experiment around...my poor dogs stomach....stick with Newmans."
Great tea to wake you up in the morning. Rich flavors. Yogi does a great job at having a variety of very tea novice friendly teas.
"I received my order in April 2010 and was disappointed to see that the expiration date on all three packages of coffee is June 2010.  The same bags of Starbucks at the grocery are usually almost a year out for the expiration date.  I won't be buying coffee online again.  Otherwise, the service and shipping were just fine.  I'm almost always happy with my purchases from Amazon-- this is a rare exception."
"I love Popchips. However, I did not like this flavor at all. The garlic flavor was too intense."

"I went to a gourmet store and asked for their ""Chocolate Expert"" to recommend a chocolate among the high-end makers.  He pointed out this brand, which was affordable as well as incredibly flavorful.  If you need a chocolate to melt in your mouth, savor the Santander 53% cocoa."
"I'll keep this short. My cat is old and has kidney problems. He is the one eating all the pumpkin puree and hasn't complained so far. It does get a bit watery compared to the other brands, but I needed the 15oz. cans so this fits the bill."
"No matter how wholesome a snack may be, it's worthless unless the girls approve. In this case they both give the Science Diet Jerky Treats two paws up. I like that beef is the first ingredient in the recipe and there are none of those unrecognizable ingredients created in a science laboratory.<br /><br />The treats are a nice size and have just enough chew to satisfy. For Piper, our shih tzu with a few missing teeth, I break the treats into smaller pieces so she can manage them.<br /><br /> On the package:<br />Use within 3 weeks of opening.<br />100% satisfaction guaranteed<br />Keep this bag out of the reach of pets and children."
"No coffee gets 5 stars from me unless it was just roasted and ground within the last half hour. Additionally, I have no problems with acid reflux. Given that, I do like a light roast; not a fan of french roast or anything Starbucks.<br />Given that, this is the first french roast I have ever liked. I found it mild smooth and drinkable. I was surprised, especially given my low expectations. If the acid in some coffee bothers you, I think this is worth a try."
"I love this mac and cheese. I switched to whole wheat pasta a few years ago and this is one of the best alternatives that fit the traditional American dish. I mix it with a can of tuna and I could eat it every night of the week. You do have to cook the noodles longer because they are more dense than the processed enriched noodles you get at the store. I've managed to convert my husband to the whole wheat pasta, but he still likes his Kraft Mac and Cheese. What can I say? I'm going healthy and its still tasty."
"These are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouth.<br /><br />For my entire life Sour Cream & Onion (and in this case ""& Chive"") chips were my favorite. Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br /><br />I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them. Hopefully they'll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips."
"I was drinking the Celestial Seasonings English Black Tea but wanted to start drinking black tea in decaf and they don't carry one. Twinings is perfect, taste the same, but no jitters for me any more. I'm a coffee convert."
"This is another favorite in our house.  My cat doesn't want it more than 4 times a month or so, but he still wants it and licks the bowl clean.  It is fish, not his favorite, but he really likes his salmon and this one is outstanding.  It's ground (why don't they make a sliced or bits version?), not his favorite either, but he does get it down pretty quickly.  Try this one - it's a definite winner."
"Bought the teriyaki flavor .....TOTALLY GROSS,<br /><br />Do not waste your money on this slimy stuff.... Could barely finish my first bite....<br /><br />I gave it one star because Amazon doesn't allow 0 star ratings..."
"I'd just like to say that this seems to be a great brand of dog food. I've been doing some research on which brand to stick with and so far this is it. After finding brands I like and then having such a difficult time getting them in the stores, I knew it was time to do more checking around. My 1 yr old dog loves Blue Buffalo! I encourage everyone to research what their pets are eating."
"I honestly have to say that I just won't buy this variety. It looks bad, smells bad and I'm sure tastes bad because my cat won't touch it.  No way, no how, won't even look at it.  My other cat was the same way with this one.  It just looks like a huge ground up mess of leftovers they had at a fish market.  I'm sure some cats must like it because it's still being made, but there's other things out there much, much better than this one."

"The fortune cookies were shipped immediately and were packed well, i.e. none arrived broken.  The cookie was delicious and the fortunes were classic chinese (and not the modern version)."
"I can only go as low as 1 star on the review, though I'd like to rate it a ""0""- this item still shows in stock, but clearly isn't, which is why my order was canceled from Amazon today. Amazon suggested I search out the item again, and in doing so I see that this same vendor states the item is available. Not so.<br /><br />Technically this review does not relate to the quality of the product, just the ability to be able to ship it. Good luck!"
"My baby like this very much.I think the salmon is delicious,the salmon is good food,it can make my baby happy."
"Although this is marketed as a coconut product, it really isn't. People seem to be having success baking with this. Now, coconut flour is delicious and tastes great in many substitute recipes, but does not have the same consistency or taste as wheat flour. When I saw all these success stories I grew suspicious.<br /><br />I looked up the ingredients for this and the first one is white rice flour. Coconut flour is the fourth ingredient (after potato starch!). Each serving packs a walloping 46g of carbs.<br /><br />If you are not necessarily gluten-intolerant but just living a low-carb lifestyle (Primal, Paleo, Atkins, Ketogenic, etc.), you'll want to avoid this."
"Wolfgang Puck recently changed their Chicken soup. The old stuff is excellent. The new stuff is watered down, not filling and doesn't taste as good. The image and description on this item stated that it was the old soup. The soup I received is the new stuff. Being a food item, returns are not allowed. I feel this was false advertizing and am extremely displeased."
"These are the most decadent, wonderful chocolates on the planet!! I covet them and share them scarely due to they are soo good everyone wants them...This was an awesome deal for a good supply. Highly Recommend."
"I was disappointed to find out that the LIDS of Earth's Best jarred foods are coated with an epoxy lining that contains BPA :(<br />I thought I was avoiding the whole BPA issue because these are in glass rather than plastic containers. If it's in the lids, it's going to get in the food as the food moves around in the jar during packaging, shipping, storage, etc. I was planning on being a devoted Earth's Best jarred food user because it was organic and in glass, but then I found out about the BPA. As a note, if BPA doesn't bother you, most of Earth's Best food is tasty."
"I am doing the ""subscribe and save"" thing with these crackers. I thought that it would take a while to get through the six boxes, but boy was I wrong. Already we're halfway through the boxes. Time to order more!"
"one of my three favorite teas (mandarin orange, sleepytime are the others); I wish you would runj more specials on this."
This candy is great.  The cost of the freight to Montana is to high.  It was more than the candy.
"I bought these for my husband who is currently overseas. He loves these, and apparently his staff likes them also.<br />There are generous amounts of Twizzlers in each 16-ounce bag, and this was well worth the price. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001GVISJM"">Twizzlers, Strawberry, 16-Ounce Bags (Pack of 6)</a>"
I love this gum.  It is very dishearting that it is so difficult to find.  I was hooked on the Cinnamon Extra until that went away.  Now this item is not available.  This world needs more Cinnamon lovers.
"In the past couple years I have eaten and reviewed several kinds and styles of chips,  from the best I've ever had to big disappointments.  If you have eaten the LantChips varieties, there is no way that they are not the best as a group; the Kettle chips are rightly salted and I was so irritated by some Pringles products.  Kettle has good flavor but the small size and overwhelming oiliness takes away from the flavors.  All in all, its good to have choice--Amazon does not stock the LantChips all the time so there are some days that there is no choice."
"I really love Kettle brand chips, but these are rather disappointing. There is very little sour cream or onion flavor."
This is a good dog food for a dogs hair and skin after giving this brand to my dog for a couple of weeks his coat feels like cotton<br /><br />Here is the part where amazon is ripping you off this same size bag the 20 pounder is only $24.19 at Wal-Mart if it is not in the store near you  check wal-Mart.com I Love amazon.com but they really got this one wrong
My baby loves this food.  At whole foods they sell the same flat for 10.99 and thats retail.  I ordered this and just received it today.  I hadn't even opened package and I could smell a rotten smell coming from box. I opened it to find jar smashed and mold everywhere! I'm so disgusted and can't believe I waited over a week for this to arrive.  What a waste of my time.  The worst part is I ordered the fruit flat as well and also a broken jar and rotten mold everywhere.  I don't get how this happens the  shipping box isn't dented or damaged neither is the flat box.  So what someone packaged and sent a smashed and rotting shipment? Not a happy customer!
"I have a Keurig B130, the machine you'll find in hotel rooms and commercial installations. The reservoir holds 8 oz. of water to make one cup of coffee. I prefer to put fresh water in a brewing device for every cup of coffee and use bottled water, exclusively, to brew. I like a bold, strong cup of coffee. This Newman blend lacks body and strength. I compared it with using a Solofill resusable K-cup,<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Solofill-Refillable-K-Cup-Keurig-Brewers/dp/B004CXG07S/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1334324776&sr=8-2<br /><br />filled with Cafe Oquendo,<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Cafe-Oquendo-Espresso-Coffee-Cubano/dp/B005IBV69K/ref=sr_1_2?s=grocery&ie=UTF8&qid=1334324953&sr=1-2<br /><br />and there was no comparison. The Solofill and Oquendo was far superior in flavor and strength. Needless to say, using the Solofill and Oquendo is also substantially less expensive."
"This is a tasty drink that is a nice alternative to soda since it's 100% all juice.  Other reviewers have mentioned that it has a tart taste to it, but to both me and my husband (who is the primary soda drinker in our family), it tasted sweet, with no aftertaste.  As my husband put it, it's sweet with a little tanginess, so that it's not overly sweet.<br /><br />Although this purports to be primarily kiwi and berry, the main juices it is composed of are apple and grape.  It is also high in calories:  a small 8.3-ounce can has 135 calories.<br /><br />Other than that, it's a nice change of pace, and it's worth a try if you're looking for a healthier alternative to soda."
"As tasty as the regular (gluten) product. Only drawback is that you don't get a lot of mix for your money. Half of the box is needed to make their 12 pancake recipe. On a good note, it's nice to have options - by far though, this was the best pancake mix I've tried...and I tried a lot!"
This coffee is only mediocre in quality. I do not like a highly acidic coffee nor do I like it when the coffee outdates within 6 weeks of the order date. The only reason I am not more dissatified with this lousy coffee is that I paid very little for it by using a credit I had at amazon payments. I do not recommend this coffee.
Wolfgang's Rodeo Drive does make a good ole cup of coffee. It is on the same line as Donut Shop. Very good morning coffee to wake up with.
"and THAT is  the problem. I order these by the case of 12 - and when they are good, which is over half the time they are the BEST kettle chip, THE BEST! and then I get a case of the worse - the potatos are mealy and old so I just throw them out and order again, expensive BUT when they are made with good fresh potatos they are the best - the last case is what prompted me to write this - the potatos were weird - like they were almost sour as in going bad - and I even wrote the company that makes them - SO if you want the BEST kettle chip there is try these and if the ones you get are NOT the best try again!<br />I, myself am done ordering because it is creeping me out that they are using soured potatos and either not noticing or not caring."
"My dog was on a bland diet (boiled chicken & rice) so his poop was usually solid but a few days after eating 1 Greenie a day, his poop became more liquid-y and green. Not sure if Greenies was actually the cause until I googled and read on various dog forums about how Greenies have affected other dogs. Stopped giving out my dog Greenies and have thrown them away. BEWARE, Greenies CAN be bad, so watch your dog after giving them out."
"Be sure to do your homework re: this product before purchasing.  I have three dogs, and they were all getting sick once Canidae changed their ""formula"" late summer to early fall.  Once I googled the product and read the many complaints, all with dogs with the same symptoms, I immediately took my dogs off of the food, and they've been healthy again since.  I'll never trust this product again, and had been a loyal customer for 3+ years."
"Seriously, my family can't live without this chili. When we don't know what to cook - it's ""open a can of chili"" or when we need comfort food. I am not a vegetarian but my son and husband are... and I think I love it more then them."
"This was my baby's first food (or at least I tried it) at 6 months. When I opened the can, a musty smell welcomed me. It had not gone bad from what I could see and it was well before the expiration date, it was just not terribly appetizing. Several times I went through the hassle of expressing breastmilk and mixing it with this stuff. There is no way I could get my baby to take this cereal, regardless of the milk to cereal ratio. I threw the stuff out and we went straight to real solids (non-pureed or mashed) after a few weeks. My baby has some preferences for which I do not want to rate this product poorly, however the musty smell was a turnoff for me too."
This coffee is smooth.  The best coffee ever.  It is pricey so I will not be buying it that often.  But worth every penny.
The Grove Square Hot Coco K-Cups have a good flavor but I find that the k-cups do not have enough hot coco mix to make that perfect cup. Thus I recommend putting a little less water in order to make each cup just right.
"These flavors are so realistic! The rotten egg and sprout flavors almost made me vomit! now when i think of the rotten egg, i feel dizzy. The cake, roasted marshmallow, and cherry ones are SO good though! i would recomand this to anyone!<br />P.S. try the black ones!"
"I roast at home with a stove-top popcorn popper (but I do it outside, of course). These beans (Coffee Bean Direct Green Mexican Altura) seem to be well-suited for this method. The first and second cracks are distinct, and I've roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time. The aroma is strong and persistent. The taste is smooth, velvety, yet lively."
These tasted SO artifical & funky! And now I'm stuck with 9 lbs of them. I tried strawberry banana rings at a local frozen yogurt shop that were delish & found this great deal & ordered assuming they'd taste the same. Boy was I wrong. These are gross!!!!
"Anyone in the US who has ever read C.S. Lewis's ""Chronicles of Narnia"" has probably wondered what Turkish Delight could be, as it is not something you can find easily here~<br />at least, not for me in Rhode Island.<br /><br />I first tried some in England as a 17 year old, and was smitten by it's rose smelling flavor.<br />Since then, I have found it intermittently in specialty stores, and online.<br /><br />Hazer Baba Turkish Delight is the freshest, most delicious Turkish Delight I've ever had, the price was great and my husband and I have polished off two of the four boxes, already.<br />It is addictive, even without being enchanted by the White Witch!<br />Highly recommended!"
"I've never had any qualms with the Oberto brand and this is an excellent deal, especially as a gift subscription! $12 every two months and my dad has an essentially limitless supply of Oberto Cocktail Pepperoni. This stuff tastes so good too, I may have to steal some from him..."
Needs to be at least twice the size it is to be effective. When the cats did manage to step on it after leaving the box it did a good job of collecting litter that I could dump back into the litter box.
"I purchased this product after reading great reviews on here.  I really like chocolate / mocha flavors, and was interested to try the raspberry.  Got the two boxes, checked the dates (sometimes an issue with K-cups I have found), and eagerly popped one into my brewer.  Smell was amazing and I was excited.  But when I tasted it, I was so disappointed.  Not strong on either the chocolate or raspberry fronts, and the coffee flavor was weak as well.  Now I am stuck with 47 cups I don't want.  I wish I could recommend these, but I must dissent against the popular reviews.  I realize everyone's tastebuds are a bit different, but these are not for me!"
"These are actually very tasty.  Pure potatoes with a great texture and no nasty filler ""stuff.""  No bacon, no cheese...just tasty potatoes.  They cook well in either the oven or microwave.  I add a touch of either salt & pepper or fajita seasoning to spice it up.  I rated 4 out of 5 stars because they could be a bit bigger portion.  However, this item is a fairly good value for the money."
VERY GOOD  BUY TWO CANS EVERY MONTH - USED TO RUN OUT WHEN I HAD THE AUTOMATIC DELIVERY ONLY ONCE EVERY TWO MONTHS
I got a case of Yuban cans from Amazon for an amazing price and now that I've been reintroduced to Yuban I'm sticking with it.  It's Colombian which is the coffee I prefer anyway but Yuban  must have a special formula for roasting and grinding that results in such excellent coffee.  Cans have the foil seals that you can peel off so you don't need to use a can opener and of course plastic lids to reseal.  Sniffing this coffee as I scoop it into my coffee maker is half the delight!!  Just so excellent and suits my tastes perfectly.  Buying the case is very convenient too!!!!
"This coffee may be low acid, but it leaves such an awful after-taste - like you're drinking burnt coffee grounds. This coffee was so bad that I poured it out and made a fresh pot of what we've been drinking. World of difference!"
"This is great full bodied hot chocolate.  It is not the wimpy stuff you will usually find, that is why I like it so much.  The chocolate taste is fully there.  If it is too chocolaty for the grandchildren you can water it down with some of the wimpy stuff, and you can drink it straight!"
"My husband and I always a cup of Big Easy Bold every morning.  Its quality has been consistent over the past several years we have ordered.  If you like a dark roast, without the bitterness sometimes found in dark roasts, this is the coffee for you."
"I have two Dogs, 12 and 1 yr old, medium size and a bit larger. both have strong health teeth, chewing bones like this for most of their lives. I was told by my Veterinarian one of the main reasons (besides no soft food) the have great oral hygiene. these natural bones are the right size and the dogs never leave them alone until they are gone or I take them away. Dont give these to them before bed time (crunch crunch crunch). I notice they develop a thirst after chewing for awhile. No digestion problems as a result of eating on these. a great bang for the buck as far as dog treats go. Strongly recommend for dogs that have good teeth."
"It looks like actual, human-grade food when you open the can. You can feed this to your cat with confidence.  My hard-to-please, anorexic cat really loved this food; I wish we'd found it sooner."
"I first tried coconut sugar after Dr. Oz mentioned it as being better for you than regular sugar. Prior to this, I had also tried organic cane sugar but, this is just wonderful and TASTY! It substitutes one-to-one for regular sugar but has this delicious taste to it. You can use it in baking, etc....but I mostly use sugar in my coffee. I had been using Truvia recently but this makes the coffee so must more delicious!!! The only drawback is that it has calories, just like sugar does but....YUM!!!"
"I sampled a can of Switch Orange Tangerine and found it to be a tasty beverage. As advertised, it is a ""...balance between juice and carbonated"" with a light carbonation so it doesn't taste like Orange Crush or Fanta but not like orange Gatorade either. The 8.3 oz can has 140 calories, with a 12% DV carb/sugar content but 100% Vitamin C and 20% Vit A. It's marketed as ""100% juice"" coming mostly from filtered concentrates. No sugar added, no corn syrup, no preservatives, no artificial colors, gluten free, if you're concerned with all that. Most important is that it tastes good and I would try it again."
"My baby didn't seem into these dinners, so I tried them. They're not terrible, but not good either. We'll stick with the EB fruits and veggies until she's ready for table foods."
"I ordered these as a suggestion from the Hungry Girl Website, my husband and I Love them.  No nasty after taste, delicious and still healthy."
"I like to brew a k-cup cocoa into my coffee for a nice mocha.  This dark chocolate flavor is quite nice, especially mixed with Double Black Diamond coffee.  Though not the very best, it is good, and the price is right, compared to other brands."
"Obviously, by looking at the other reviews people think this stuff is either really good or really bad. I think it is all according to your taste and what you are expecting for this price. I ordered packets from two different web sites and they both taste ok just like a frosty/rich shake ordered from a drive thru window. It was ok but I wouldn't pay the price for it again. I found a recipe from the Serendipity 3 restaurant where you make your own Frozen Hot Chocolate by adding tiny bits of REAL chocolate, a bit of milk, cocoa,and some ice into a blender. I have a feeling that is the recipe that taste much more like what Oprah said was so good and more equivalent to what the restaurant actually serves. If you want more than just an expensive milkshake I would try the recipe using real chocolate and stay away from this drive thru milkshake mix."
Probably because it doesn't taste like coffee.  It is flavorless.  I saw the good reviews and thought I'd get a couple boxes and now I'm stuck with a bunch of k cups that I don't want to drink because I'd rather literally drink any other k cup I've ever tried.  As you can see I'm not a fan of these k cups.  These are the worst ever.
"I would like to try this, however I do not see anything that says exactly what this product is made of, did I miss something? They only say what it is not! Would really like to know."
"If you are a bacon lover and like mayonnaise on sandwiches, this is for you.  It is great as a dip too.  I have mixed it with cream cheese and it still holds its flavor."
"Not thrilled with this one - threw most of it away.  For some reason, the result ended up being ""gummy"" which isn't something I expected from this type of product."
"This wheat-free bread mix is better than I expected.  The bread is moist and tasty, and it makes a passable pie crust (without the yeast)."
If you love coconut you will love these!  I eat too many at a time is the only problem with this product!  Enjoy!
"My 2nd adventure for health into ingesting Aloe.  My first taste had me realizing this was way too sweet to be a health drink.  Upon examination the very small font list of ingredients, I found; 1st Aloe Gel, 2nd Honey(surprising), 3rd High Fructose Corn Syrup... yep... 15 grams of sugars per cup 160ml the bottle that is the size of a small bought water bottle is 500ml... I easily gulped it down before my full study was complete. Down the end of ingredients there is artificial green grape flavor...we all need that...to match the green bottle I guess.<br />  After I mixed it 50/50 with filtered water I was able to actually taste other than sweet and it was not bad with a bit of pulp that I liked as in pulp orange juice.  I added some pure Aloe Juice to get it closer to the health drink I stupidly assumed associated with Aloe... and will make it thru the case I ordered.<br /><br /> I suppose if your looking for a better after school replacement drink than say.. Mt Dew, for one of the many new obese children it may suffice...but keep a tongue depressor handy for surely down the road they will be falling down and shaking at this sugar level as well."
"I have tried this coffee hot and iced,with milk and black and I tested the pH.  Frankly it won't qualify as a great cup of coffee.  The flavor is burnt (like Starbucks dark roast) but is flat and it lacks middle notes and vanillins (unlike Starbucks.)  Perhaps flavors other than French Roast would be better at providing complexity as that frequently comes from Colombian roast in a blend. The aroma is underwhelming.<br /><br />The pH of the Puroast coffee tested at 6.5, slightly acidic (neutral is 7 on a scale of 0-14.0) but less so than normal coffee.  Normal coffee ranges from around 5.0 - 5.1, more neutral than beer or any fruit juice and similar to carbonated water. If you can drink those, then your stomach isn't reacting to the acidity but something else. So normal coffee, whether it irritates you or not, isn't all that acidic.  Acidity generally refers to a flavor note in coffee rather than pH and coffee without acid flavor notes tastes flat.  Irritation may instead come from the essential oils in the beans or the caffeine.<br /><br />(Having too much stomach acid has exactly the same symptoms as too little stomach acid and most people over 35 are slightly deficient in hydrochloric acid and 50% of people over 50 are seriously hypochlorhydric, but we are taught to regard the symptoms as being from acidity. Your Tums work by other mechanisms, beyond the scope of this review.)<br /><br />So while Puroast is attempting to solve an acid/base problem that doesn't significantly exist, the fact that the flavor is low probably means that the essential oils in the beans are lowered as well, making the coffee less irritating.  Frankly I'd rather add about 20% chicory to good coffee, which slightly sweetens the taste and is less irritating.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001M11HI"">Frontier Natural - Chicory - Roasted, 1 lbs</a>Is it worth giving up flavor to drink coffee?  Your call, but I wouldn't bother with the Puroast French Roast."
"The chocolate is just as delicious as could be expected. The wrap is easy to remove and re wrap again. The kisses in the inside come in a nice bag, keeping them safe inside. The box it comes in is sturdy enough. I ordered two, one came intact and the other came demolished on one side...very very disappointed."
"Out of all the herbal teas I have tried, and there have been many, this is the tea that you can drink any time of the day."
"arrived on time, all that is well, but did not taste good! i mean it's quick, microwaveable, etc., but the taste was off and i couldn't even finish the pack of 6."
"I am a preschool teacher and do a G is for Gingerbread unit every January. I was on vacation during Christmas and when I got back not a gingerbread kit was to be found. Which is odd. I needed one for my preschool class and needed it in less then a week. I looked everywhere and could not find ont. So I had one overnighted from Amazon on NYE and it came yesterday. I pick this one because of the Rudolph theme. The gingerbread itself came broken. Like unable to use would need a glue gun to get it to work broken. It's non returnable. I called Amazon, they were nice enough to order me a second one since I spend a ton of money each year with them. This one also came broken. I order A LOT from Amazon and things do not come broken. I think only one time have I had returned something because it was broken in 100's of orders. But two of the same thing in a row?! I think it's the kit itself and nothing to do with how it was shipped. I will say most come UPS and overnight comes Fed Ed. But it's bubble wrapped very well. I think the gingerbread isn't good and cracks in shipping and breaks off. The rest of the kit is very cute. The first kit the candies had spilled out and where a mess in the box. But the second kit while the gingerbread was all broken up again the candies were all in their bags. Too bad. But I would try something else, stay away from this one."
"I spent close to $4.00 for each cube which turned out to be the 16oz size.  I know it says that upon further review but I was assuming it was the 3lb size because that size is $3.99 at the grocery.  And I just paid the same thing for the 1lb size?!  Shame on you Amazon.  Or better yet shame on me.  The expiration date is fast approaching too so I'm not even sure I'll use these up in a month.  I was very disappointed in the price as well as the expiration date.  I had the same issue with some sunflower seeds I bought recently, they expired before baseball season even started.  However, I did get what I paid for...it's just my mistake for not realizing the size was not what I thought I was getting.  Who would pay that for the 1lb size?"
Made my dogs breath fresh but these were a little too small for even my Shih Tzus & Pekinese - I was scared they would choke on them.  I would recommend the company not making them so small and just sticking with the medium ones.
"I enjoyed these chopped walnuts very much. They are fresh and crunchy and are perfect for use in trail mix or as a topping for ice cream, yogurt, etc.<br /><br />I like the small eight oz. bag.  It's a very convenient size that doesn't leave me wondering how to keep a whole pound of nuts fresh if I have to open the bag just to use a few walnuts on my granola in the morning.<br /><br />However, for some uses (i.e. making chunky chocolate chip cookies), I have found that the shelled walnuts work much better for me than these chopped walnuts do.  The small pieces (chopped walnuts are really just walnut crumbs) seem to blend more into the background of baked goods than the big shelled walnut chunks do.<br /><br />For that reason, I prefer the Diamond shelled walnuts to their chopped walnuts.  However, both products are very good."
"I thought I needed to clean my machine...however, it was this coffee.  When I placed another companies coffee in, it tasted fine.<br />I have 2 boxes if anyone wants them."
Super good price and the best k cup cocoa we have found.<br /><br />I am glad I found this for our family before the big cocoa season hits !<br /><br />love it
"I was excited to try this product after reading all of the good reviews. I wasn't really impressed when my son tried the food. The consistency was WAY too thin, and my son would hardly eat the whole jar. I would recommend making your own baby food, or use the Gerber organic."
this product taste stale and is full of artificial ingredients.<br />NO REAL PEPPERMINT IS IN THIS PRODUCT and to be honest it doesnt even taste like real cocoa is either.
"I am diabetic and I don't like artificial sugar, but I really like this hot chocolate.  Sweet enough and also has enough chocolate flavor.  I love it."
Very yummy!  My kids and I loved it!  Cute story on the box too!
All baking soda is aluminum free. This is an unnecessary marketing ploy to get you to buy their product. Buy this because it is naturally mined and is cruelty free; but do not be duped into thinking that good ole $.59 Arm&Hammer has aluminum in it. BTW the chemical process used to make A&H is almost exactly what occurs in nature; just faster but not cheaper. It costs no more to mine sodium bicarbonate than it does to manufacture. So yes you are paying for a name.
"Somehow my previous review got deleted. I live in Houston, TX. I buy lots of bottled water-cannot tell any difference between a bottle of Talking Rain and a glass of cold tap water."
Inexpensive little mat. But it's so small and doesn't help when my cat kicks litter out of anywhere other than right in front of the box. And like others have written its got little spokes poking out so my cat didn't even like to step on it so it made even more of a mess. It needed to be cleaned daily and it was just overall more hassle than the small price tag.
"I first tried these drops when a friend left them at my house by accident.  I instantly loved it and ended up using the rest of the bottle over the next few weeks!  (Note to self buy a replacement for my buddy!) One to two drops and you will have SUPER minty breath.  I use them at work and people twenty feet away will start saying they smell peppermint :)<br /><br />They can be very strong so start off with one drop and work your way up.  Currently I will use two to three drops on my the back of my hand and then lick it up.  It sounds funny but these are the directions for use.  I believe you can also mix a drop or two with a glass of water and use as mouthwash.  If I eat something like onions or garlic I will use up to four drops, but I love the mint smell and sensation of inhaling the vapors so you're milage may vary.  You can also put a tiny bit uder your nostrils and it will help with sinus issues.<br /><br />As far as any negatives go one I can think of is that after putting the drops on the back of your hand it will leave a white residue behind but it is easily washed off.  Also the price is a bit high in my opinion but a bottle can last about a month and its a good alternative to gum or mints.  Lastly I wish it came in a larger bottle size even just for refilling the small 10oz bottle it comes in.<br /><br />Some people might not like this product.  I have let some co-workers try it and a couple have said its just too strong for them and I have heard one even say he did not like the way it tastes.  Personally for me it's a smell thing and to me it tastes fine, basically like nothing if you take the smell part away.  Some of my friends just think I am weird for putting drops on the back of my hand and licking it off :)<br /><br />I love this stuff and highly recommend it if you want some serious minty breath!<br /><br />Also I think its a natural product with the ingredients being peppermint oil and chlorophyll if that kind of thing is important to you."
I tried these buscuits in Italy and was determined to find them in the US. I was very pleased to see that Amazon was selling them. I bought the pack of 7. The packacking was done quite well; the item came intact. Very happy with the purchase.
"Just made my first pot of this wonderful coffee. It was simply delish! Subtle hint of cinnamon. It wasn't overpowering, which I was worried about. I've had 2 cups already. I'll be making this lots! It's difficult to find flavored types of coffee that are decaf. Thumbs up! :-)"
"I ordered Wolf Gang Puck's k cups, largely because of his reputation and my experiences at his restaurants, both of which are good. However, when I drank my first cup of the Breakfast Blend, I tasted no coffee...it was as if I was drinking hot water. I was very disappointed and will purchase only those k cups which I know to be good. Sorry Wolf Gang, this is a sleeper!"
"These are the best doggie treats ever. My little dachshunds go crazy for these. If I forget to give them their morning greenies, they come looking for me in the house and leap in the air and whine until I get up and go to the cabinet and fetch them a greenie. They do a good job keeping their breath clean too."
This is an excellent product. The taste is delicious and it is great for sauteing since it has a high smoke point. I also love that it is grass-fed! I will definitely recommend this to my health-conscious friends.
These items were delivred quickly and exactly as promised.  Thank you.  Super large container and the pieces were well intact.<br />Thanks you.
"My dogs need pumpkin in their diet and it's not available locally.  This organic pumpkin, while expensive, fills the bill and my pups are happy.  It's good quality.  Liked the free shipping."
"This tea rocks! I tried it first at work and before long, so did everyone else and they have YET to restock our shelves with this, thus, me coming to Amazon.com and buying in bulk for myself and everyone else who pitched in to ensure they had some too. Its a tasty flavor and very smooth. Only bad thing is that this particular flavor s NOT sold in stores. I add some creamer and some honey and it really boosts the flavor."
"I was excited to purchase this tea and found out thats its not good.  I brewed it on small setting and big, very weak, not of quality.  I have one of the Raspberry and one lemon I have to figure out how to get rid of."
"We've been feeding this food to our wheaten terrier for a year, with happy results - until last Tuesday, when my latest subscribe-and-save bag was opened: my dog started throwing up during the night after eating from this new bag. On the first night, I figured she'd eaten something bad off the street. On the second night, I figured it was the lingering effects of eating something bad off the street. On the third night, I started looking for other causes for the nighttime retching, and I realized that the vomiting had started on the same day as we'd started the new bag. I stopped feeding the dog the Newman's Own and the vomiting stopped for 2 nights. Last night, I fed her the food again, and sure enough, she threw up in the night.<br /><br />I trusted and liked this food - and all things under the Newman's Own brand - but i'll never buy their products again. They clearly have a dangerous quality control problem."
"I would prefer to drink the regular Lavazza all the time,  but when I cannot handle the caffeine I use this.  It is a very good coffee."
"I opened this product to find that the lollipops were all broke, I was very disappointed.  They did not package this product in a way that would help keep it from breaking.  You are better off buying them from a store around your area."
"the product was simply not recognized by my windows 7 home premium computer. very disappointed, considering on the Blue website it says that it is. I gave this the extra star because im sure its a great product, but the lack of communication of the compatibly was very disappointing. Most likely wont be buying anything else from Blue"
Love the cinnamon taste but way too sweet. I gave this to my Mother who loves sweets and she said she couldn't eat it either. Need to promote the cinnamin dlavor and cut the sugar
These sell for .89 cents at the grocery store. How many are they selling for $5 here?
"Wow, I'm impressed. These are delicious. They cure your carb cravings and are much better for you than traditional carb-binging snacks!"
"i wish these folks used sea salt...(and i've made that request to them).  however, i appreciate that the ingredients are simple and minimal, although not necessarily gluten free."
"I usually do not like rice, and I have a husband who does. He has tried to feed me several types in the 7 years we have been together, to no avail. I do not like rice, I never have.<br /><br />That is, until he came home with THIS rice... I LOVE it, I need it, I want it every day... And, whatever sticks to the pot a little, or what is left over, we feed to the dog, and he is used to good stuff too.<br />The dog eats it with as much gusto as I do.<br />Our 10 year old son who would eat white pasta with ketchup if he were allowed loves this rice too.<br /><br />We won't buy any other anymore.<br /><br />It has tons of flavor, it has a bite, it is wholesome and nutritious. BUY it!"
"While good quality, it was not at all what I expected. It smelled like caramel and vanilla, but it tasted like straight black coffee. I was pretty disappointed."
My sister and I are both having problems with coffee acidity and this package is wonderful.  The taste is great and really smooth going down.  Neither of us has had any problem with this pot of coffee and will look for more.
"Didn't realize it was flavored and thought, when I had my first sip, that it tasted like chemicals. F-. Gave it away the next day at work."
"I remember the Space Craze of the late 60s early 70s, and Mom buying Space Food Sticks. Originally they were long round tuby looking things. The box rarely made it home before being completely consumed. I like the Astronaut ice creams too. My only wish is that it had the Astronaut pizza. They used to sell the pizza at the Air Force Museum in Ohio where I worked. Anyway, the box of goodies is a bit small but enjoyable."
"To purchase these, you must buy 6 tubes and pay expensive shipping costs.  I was excited and willing because I love this flavor, but over time, I realized the unopened tubes were leaking on the box and the boxes were sticking to my pantry shelf.  I threw them all away which made it a complete waste.  I would have tried to rescue the paste earlier by putting it in plastic tubs and freezing or SOMETHING.  BTW, the expiration date on the unopened tubes was 16/11/2012. (European labeling)  The tubes appear to be about to explode which leads me to believe there could be possibly be bacterial contaminants?  I don't know, but something made these packages leak on the crimped edges. Obviously, I would not recommend OR buy them again."
"I bought my wife a new popcorn popper for her birthday and was looking for some high quality popcorn to go with it. She loves movie theater popcorn, and others said they thought this popcorn had similar taste. Well, they're RIGHT! This is fantastic tasting popcorn. It pops up fluffy and tastey, with very few unpopped kernals. I was very pleased with the pre-measured packaging making it super easy to dump in the machine and let it do all the work. We've already re-ordered a box since our first batch, and I am anxiously waiting for it to come back in stock so we can order even more!"
"I like the taste of this product, but I have some suggestions:<br /><br />1) for strongest blueberry taste, use less than the 16 ounces of water that the instructions indicate (my first try came out like water with the merest hint of blueberry);<br /><br />2) stir REALLY well and be prepared for a bit of sediment anyway, as well as for an oddly green (I know it's green tea, but I rarely drink green things, so it seemed a bit weird to me at first); and<br /><br />3) if you're going to use a sweetener, why cancel out the health bennies by adding something like aspartame or Splenda or etc? I added a bit of agave nectar and found it perfect, but then I also like it without any sweetener at all (as long as I use less water).<br /><br />By the way, this makes hot tea as well, although it's marketed as iced tea powder.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
"I'm not exaggerating when I say that I was a hardcore caffeine addict last semester with microbiology and organic chemistry to study for. I'd say 4-5 cups of coffee/day would be an accurate count - that is until I realized how jittery i'd become after my 3rd or 4th cup. I stopped cold turkey once finals ended and the withdrawal effects were horrible - I could not wake up past noon. I always liked how mio made my water taste better, but I wished it had some kind of stimulant effect...and then, voila! mio energy! i was immediately drawn to it's appetizing color and loved its apple/kiwi taste. It's a lot cheaper than buying a cup of coffee/day and it doesn't go bad. I bought a couple - one for my purse, another for my backpack and even gave one to my sister. It's the perfect energy boost for when a yawn creeps up during the middle of the day. boost of energy without the crash!"
"I have suffered from heartburn for years and never thought that it might be due to the coffee I drink so I was very excited to give this a try.  I loved the taste of the coffee and my heartburn might have been a tad bit better, but it wasn't significant.  I guess it is possible that my heartburn is due to something other than the coffee I drink.  I would still recommend this product though because it is very good coffee."
"Yes the water appears clear, but once the water is heated for tea it turns the tea cloudy. Why is that, well it means it has impurities. Perhaps bacteria?? I'm a Registered Nurse not a water expert, but I can tell you that I am right about the water. I can run my well water from my tap and get the same results, it's awful.  I normally use Brita filters with the pitcher provided and when I heat or even boil the water the tea stays clear. This Means no bacteria have been killed off by the heating process, it means you'd be better off drinking the Brita water!!!!!! I gave this bottle water a chance I got a second case and the same thing happen. I wouldn't drink this water straight from the bottle ever. As a nurse I know it's not a good idea.  If you ever want to know if water is good or clear of bacteria/impurities you can make Lipton tea hot then, as it cools down IF the tea turns very cloudy it has dead bacteria and other impurities. I used the ice cubes made from this bottled water as well, so nothing is different except the tea.  Tried the Brita water and Brita made ice cubes and it remained clear.  Sorry not a good review from me I am afraid.<br /><br /> I was very disappointed as I thought ""yeah"" a bottled water I can carry to work, so I am not force to pay $1.50 for a bottle from the machine, but it turn out not to be so.<br /><br />Okay, so I tried another company on this website Nestles which in my region came as Deer Park. I have never tried this brand but it is so much better it doesn't,t turn cloudy when I boil it.  So you be you own judge."
These dried Bing cherries are absolutely delicious. I have used them with wild rice and toasted pecans for a side dish. I plan to use them with a roast pork tenderloin soon. Excellent quality and price.
This is not the product I received.  They changed the product.  It now has chunks of tomato in the soup.  This is not what I wanted.
"I purchased two orders of these as gifts because it looks attractive in the photo and there appears to be a reasonable amount of nuts.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Turns out there is very little nut meats in this product.<br />The illusion was created by the the cellophane (wrapper or bags) folded underneath the nuts.<br /><br />I thought it was odd there weren't many reviews of this product, but I took a chance... unfortunately. Live and learn."
"To be honest, I don't care if my food is organic and would just as soon die early as eat most health foods. But I do like oatmeal, and have enjoyed other Dr. McDougall's products, so I gave this a shot.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed. It tastes better than most other instant oatmeals. The fruit bits add plenty of sweetness and there are enough to get some in every bite. The portion size is substantial and has 300 calories for the whole cup which is not too much for breakfast.<br /><br />My only advisory is that if you do not like your oatmeal too ""soupy"" add less than the recommended amount of water."
"I bought this candy on a whim because I love pretty much all things coconut. I figured it would taste like a m&m's version of an almond joy minus the almonds, but was much disappointed. It tasted like an overly sweet waxy coconut body lotion, with a hint of chocolate and candy shell. UTTERLY DISGUSTING. Too late, i noticed on the ingredients list there was no coconut at all to be found--it's all artificial flavoring.<br />I had to throw the bag away."
"This is marketed as healthy all natural all juice.  From the full nutrition label, Switch lives up to that claim.  The ingredients are juice concentrates and added vitamin C.  No added sugar.  Just like juice, you get fruit sugar and fruit nutrients, but none of the fiber.  That's to be expected from a juice, although it seems some other reviewers were alarmed to discover that fruit is sweet due to sugar rather than naturally growing aspartame or sucrose.  Healthwise, this seems fine to me.<br /><br />As to taste: This was close to what I was expecting, but surprisingly sweet.  I could taste the kiwi and berry.  The carbonation was light, and added a bit of texture.<br /><br />I tasted this flavor as well as the ""black cherry"" flavor.  I didn't like black cherry, but I liked this and would have it again.  If the concept of carbonated fruit juice appeals to you, then<br />this is a good flavor to start with.<br /><br />Here is the nutritional information:  8.5fl oz., 135 calories, 0g fat, 15 mg sodium, 34 g total carbs, 33 g sugar, 0g protein, 100% vitamin C.<br /><br />ingredients:  100% juice (filtered sparkling water sufficient to reconstitute juice concentrates, apple, grape, kiwi, acerola, raspberry and strawberry juice concentrates), natural flavors, ascorbic acis (vitamin C)"
"This is my fourth order of these pork rinds and I'm not sure what's up, but something's really amiss.  The bags are leaking some kind of grease and don't fluff up during the microwave process.  I used to love these, so hopefully this is just a bad batch.  If not, then Lowrey's needs to look into this and fix whatever has happened to a once great snack."
I love cornbread. This is cheap & very good. It is sweet & delicious. It is also very easy to prepare. I enjoy it with real butter or a little honey. Great stuff! Can't beat it for price! I usually buy this at the store though.
This is one our favorite coffees. We buy this over and over. It is a good strong coffee. I recommend it to everyone I know.
"For the price you pay and size of each cup (you can really only make the smallest size) you are getting taken with this purchase. Buy the traditional mix from any other company, you will get a better value, better taste and a richer texture. This snot a horrible mix, it tastes ok, but it is nothing more than a decent cup of chocolate flavored water. It has no thickness to it. Swiss Miss or any other grocery store hot chocolate beats it hands down.<br />All you are getting with this is convenience of using K-cups, which is not much of one to begin with.<br />Avoid it."
I did nto like this coffee. its too dark for my taste but my brother loves it and swears by it so for him it was great! for me not so much!
So I'm a deployed soldier and there's a disappointing lack of any pumpkin here. I bought this so I could have that nice fall pumpkin coffee experience. I was sad to discover that this tastes not evenly remotely like pumpkin. The shipping time was the only thing that pleased me about this order.
"Overpriced beans, they are packed in a glass tube that is not air tight.<br /><br />The beans were thin and almost dry.<br /><br />Get the cheaper options at amazon instead, they are much better and way cheaper..."
"Our puppy loves this paste. We stuff in a regular puppy kong, sometimes as a sealing for other food and some times by itself."
"I don't eat chips often, but when I do, these are some of my favorites. They have all the flavor and texture of traditional tortilla chips, but it is the subtle lime flavoring that makes them special. The lime flavoring appears to be a seasoning that has been dusted on. Some chips seem to have barely any flavor and I find myself looking for those with the most. Still, none of them have quite enough for my tastes. I wish that these chips had more that just a ""hint"" of lime."
"Heard about these from a triathlete who said that they worked fast.  An avid hiker, I have used other energy gels with limited success.  Taken about 15 minutes before an uphill climb, they provide the extra boost you need.  The chews have a great texture and taste like gummi bear candy.  Highly recommended."
"Let me start out by saying that one can of Switch just wasn't enough...at least not when you're sharing it!! In order to properly review this, I had my children join me in a little taste test of this product. Well, the best litmus test of whether something is good or not...is if your kids want more. And mine both did...but I wasn't sharing any more of this delicious drink. No sir, I'm happy to report that the remainder of this libation was imbibed by yours truly.<br /><br />I'm not generally of big fan of the carbonated juice drinks, but Switch could switch my mind. The kiwi-strawberry taste was just right...not too sweet and blended well with the carbonation for a drink that was tasty and refreshing. In fact, this drink would be great for a hot day or after a workout when you want something with some bite and don't really want or need another soda.<br /><br />This is good stuff...get some."
"This makes a nice robust cup of coffee without being bitter or tasting scorched, just a good coffee taste. Its not overpriced; and will please most anyone you serve it to. I will be buying this again, pleased with this purchase."
"I recently tried the five pack Wabash ""Real theater popcorn.""  When cooking, there is a very off smelling aroma emanating from my popper.<br />So?  I tried Paragon popcorn oil in place of the Wabash product and had no more ""smelly"" issues.  Neither product offers much in the way of actual product content.  Hydrogenated or non-hydrogenated coco oil?  The latter better than the former....both not so good, anyway.<br />If you pop corn once in a while with Paragon + flavacol, you will not go wrong.  I wouldn't consume this combo very often, like maybe once or twice a month?.......by the same token, just like eating fat laden prime rib, potato chips, hotdogs, all the good stuff, is bad for your cholesterol lol.<br />Sadly all the snacks and fast foods we enjoy.....sucks.<br />C'est la vie."
"After trying this product for about one month, I can say that it definitely provides me with more energy in the morning.  It also seems effective in fighting off the initial effects of a common cold (at least for me). I found that this product dissolves best with ice cold water/juice. Overall, this product seems to work as advertised."
"I was so happy to see all twelve cans in pristine condition and with ""use by"" dates two years off stamped on the tops.  Another highly pleasant surprise came when I had my first taste.  This pumpkin is without a doubt better tasting than Libby's.  With the Subscribe and Save discount, this superior product actually costs a tad less than what I pay for Libby's at my local store.  And with the added convenience of home delivery!  I use a couple cans each week because it is loaded with nutrients and fiber and being a thick puree it is very useful in creating good things to eat.  I have put about a tablespoon on a dish for my cat twice and she ate it up both times which rather amazed me."
"I'm angry that I didn't try this sooner.  It beats the pants off of the powdered stuff in pre-measured packets, that's for sure!  I love the hint of cinnamon.  When I made the first batch, I thought that it may have a grainy feel, because it looks a little grainy, but it does not have a grainy mouthfeel at all.  My husband was hesistant (he thinks cinnamon smells like armpits (???)), but anyway, he was in love with it, too.  Wish I would have tried this many years ago!"
This coffee is for those who like a strong robust flavor. Nothing wimpy about it. I like just enough cocoa mix and creamer to take off the edge. My husband goes for the gusto. Great wake-me-up-in-the-morning brew. Love it!
This is absolutely the BEST Fajita marinade I've ever tasted -- whether using it on chicken or beef. Recently cooking with it on both; rave reviews ensued. Everyone loved the meal. Figaro Fabulosa will be my lifetime first choice for making the most delicious Fajitas ever.
"I'm a repeat customer. This is always the best price, fastest shipping and best of all. most affordable syrup products!  Thanks for selling on Amazon.com!"
"This is absolutely the best hot chocolate out there. It is not too sweet, so more for adults than for kids. Easy to make. Just add milk. No intense mixing required. Dissolves easily."
"This is my favorite waffle mix (it can be used to make pancakes too, but you have to add milk, and we don't usually have milk in the house).  You have to add water, 1 egg, and melted butter for the waffle recipe.  We eat waffles about once a week.<br /><br />Apart from the fact that it tastes great (it has a little vanilla and malt mixed in), it has NO trans fat.  Some pancake/waffle mixes, such as Krustead's which also tastes really good, say they have no trans fat PER SERVING, but if it has partially hydrogenated vegetable oil in the ingredients, there is still some (less than than 1 percent) trans fat per serving.  Stonewall has none.<br /><br />We used to have a store that sold it locally, but now we don't so I am glad we can get it online.<br /><br />The can comes with a recipe that is perfect for making two belgian waffles with no leftover batter.<br /><br />We just bought the regular mix but we are going to try the other flavors next."
"The oatmeal inside the canisters was good.  However, the packaging by Amazon was terrible.  Every single can arrived dented, and several of the cans popped open.  Amazon treats products terribly... I haven't ordered from Amazon in a long time, not since they sent me expired Pirate's Booty, which I tossed.  I thought they had gotten better and decided to give them another try.  What a  mistake.  Never again.  Customer service at Amazon leaves much to be desired, as well.  IF you get someone, they'll probably speak broken English and be very hard to understand.  Then they will not understand the problem.  You'll have to ask for a supervisor who, you hope, will speak better English.  Be prepared to wait a LONG time for a supervisor, and you may be disconnected several times before actually getting through to a supervisor.  The supervisor will ask for every piece of identification imaginable, not short of your SSN, before saying, ""Well, what do you want me to do?""  ""Uh, you're customer service... Service the customer???""  Amazon has lost my business forever."
I would say this is the best tasting popcorn  have eaten.  It to me is better than movie thearte popcorn.  It has the right mixed of salt and oil to give it a really good flavor
Ordering my coffee from Amazon is so easy and postage free.  I don't know how they do it but when my box is getting low here comes an offer on my e-mail.  I could buy it at my local grocery for a penny more but the convenience of having coffee delivered to my front door is worth the penny it cost. I don't have to walk in the snow or drive my car for $4.00 per gallon.  Thank you Uncle Amazon
"I had to be taken to the ER in an ambulance earlier, the day before yesterday. I was having seizures, near-syncope (passing out, but still being somewhat conscious), couldn't breathe, and my blood pressure was at stroke level. I felt like and thought I was dying (or maybe already) dead for about 3 hours. It was painful and horrifying. I think I figured out what it was that caused my near-death experience. It was probably the energy-shot I took 20 minutes before then. I don't usually take something like that. Someone offered it to me, and I was so tired, I didn't even look at the bottle and took it. Please, don't use these!"
"These chips are outstanding!!  Use in place of tortilla chips with salsa, and you will never go back. Forget the fact that they are healthy, these chips are delicious!"
"since we began using this several years ago our senior dogs raely need to visit the vet. When we were feeding a well know premium petstore brand  we were there at least 1 time every six weeks. they love the taste of newmans it keeps their tummy in tip top shape. NO more food alergies. No more vomiting, Made with bells & evans chicken the same chicken sold at whole foods & other organic food sellers. If its good enough for you, it's good enough for them. All Mr Newmans profits go to animal shelter and rescue organization. Give this food 12 weeks see the improvememnt yourself."
"These chocolates are made in small batches in Kohler Wisconsin. We use to drive to Kohler to buy them. It's good to know that you can order them on Amazon. Each piece has an amazing combination of flavors and textures. I particularly enjoy the ones with molasses, they are called Blackstrap terrapins. Let me know if you like them."
"I grew up in Ohio and lived in the woods where sassafrass trees were plentiful. I would dig tender roots or ""bark"" a few trees for a delightful tea.  I purchased Breezy Morning Sassafrass tea and although was quite good it was very expensive for only 20 average size tea bags and shipping was as much as the product.  Not a good bargain.  I switched to Pappy's extract."
"This time, forget ordering through Amazon.  You can get the same product, 24 K-Cups for $12.75 at Big Cat or for $14.80 at Keurig.  These prices are a rip off."
"I have tried three brands of coconut water and this is my favorite.  It is sweet, but naturally so.  Unfortunately the price is a bit high for me.  If it becomes available as a subscription and/or the price lowers, I will switch back to it.  I tried Zico and found it to be a bit sour and bitter for my taste.  I am using Roland cans now.  It is not as healthy as it has sugar and water added, but I love the coconut bits and the taste is good and the price is right."
I bought this at a local Albertsons recently and it is not at all as advertised.  There is no cheesy flavor detectable in the product.  Even the salt flavor is off.  Avoid this product.
"Bought a can yesterday from a local store. The expiration was 2013, but it really smelled bad! What am I supposed to do now? Open every single can and do a smell test before buying?"
"Several Gevalia brand coffee's have been among my favorites for years....Velvet Noir, Signature Blend, Traditional Roast, etc.  The Breakfast Blend is my ""go to"" every day grind.  It's got a perfect blend of bold rich taste, terrific aroma, and full taste, with very low acidity and harshness.  Just incredible coffee!"
"I have been so happy with this product!  My baby girl has always had a sensitive tummy, up late hours w/ pains and crying with nothing to sooth her.  I finally found this product, our natropath suggested it.  My daughter loves it and it really helped her tummy!  Now, I wont giver her any other formula.  It organic and difficult to find at local stores in my area.  I found amazon to have the best price and its easy to have it delivered to the door.  Id suggest this formula to anyone!"
I love the tubes of hrissa!  There is much less waste and the flavor is just as wonderful as the same product in the cans.
"Not for the faint hearted! This is really, really hot stuff! I tasted 1 drop on a toothpick and it burnt badly for 10 minutes. But it's all good:))))"
The coffee was great. Spent some time in Jamaica and got to love the coffee. Nice to get in back home as well.
You can purchase this for $35.00 including free shpping straight from Penta's Website.<br /><br />I really enjoy drinking this. I can see a difference with my everyday life.
I enjoy the selection and they have all met my expectations so far.  My sister wioll not try any favor but milk chocolate but I am glad I brought the variety pack anyway
"I totally agree with the reviewer who said this mayo is wayyy to hot!! I bought this mayo for my boyfriend who loves pepper with his sandwiches. I was alittle skeptical because I like pepper but not alot. So I reluctantly bought this because I really like the regular olive oil mayo.<br />I was the first one to try this mayo. I had made me a club sandwich with turkey, turkey bacon, avocado, tomatoes, green leaf lettuce and then this mayo... The only thing I tasted was this mayo!!! It overpowered the whole sandwich. I didnt even use that much either... I was starving so I choked down this sandwich. Then I sat and drank, drank, drank some more just to get the pepper out of my mouth!! This was horrible...<br />Then I gave some to my boyfriend to try and he spit it out!! He was like man what are you trying to do, poison me with pepper! I told him that is the mayo you had me buy with the cracked pepper in it. He said throw that jar away and get the regular olive oil mayo. This stuff is nasty!!<br />I understand that everyone has their own opinion of food but this is really hot and overpowering with pepper. Like one reviewer said that it has cracked pepper in it so why would you buy it if you dont like pepper. I like pepper and my boyfriend loves pepper but this went in the trash!"
"I never thought anything could pull me away from my Jif, but this stuff actually tastes good. Okay, it's maybe not quite as good as the big J, but for 85% less fat and calories it is well worth the slight difference."
"THE CAN DOES NOT SAY ""NO ANTIBIOTICS"". I called the company and asked why the can does not say this.  First, she tells me that THEY HAVE NO ANTIBIOTICS BUT the FDA won't allow them to put it on their can.  I said ""lots of companies put no antibiotics on their label"".  Then she said we are making a new label.  I felt a definate flippant attitude.  I felt like she just wanted me to get off the phone.<br /><br />Well, I just canceled my autoship for their goat milk. I am now looking for another goat milk that puts ""no antibiotics"" on their label.  I know that there are some good goat milk companies that do this."
After opening the box it looking like it fell down a set of stairs.  Most of the crackers in the packages were cracked and full of crumbs.  My husband is gluten intolerant and he likes these crackers.  I guess we won't be ordering them this way again.  We are both very disappointed.
"I am a fan of Pamela's gluten free products and have been happy with all of them until I got the Raisin Walnut Cookies. I just received the order a couple of days ago. I've eaten four of the cookies and they are very good tasting. However, in two of the four cookies I found myself chewing what presumably was walnut shells! I could have easily chipped or broken a tooth.<br /><br />Pamela's makes some great products but this one is ""risky""."
"My whole family loves this product, often times we struggle to find something like this that we can all have (some members of my family have severe nut allergies).  This product is nut free and clearly states what the ingredients are."
"I read about these on [...] and decided to try them.  I bought the variety pack so as not to get stuck with one flavor if I didn't like them.  I really tried to like these because of the health benefits but I ended up throwing out the whole case after tasting one of each flavor.  If you are looking for these as a substitute for potato chips, forget it.  They really do taste like dissolving cardboard.  Stick with baked Lays!"
"I missed Shake 'n' Bake.  I haven't had this stuff since I was a kid.  It was so easy, except I was surprised by one thing: it didn't come with a bag.  It is just a packet of seasoning - I thought I remembered this coming with a bag.  No big deal, I always have spare Ziploc bags on hand, and I didn't even use one for this.  I simply poured the seasoning on a plate and dipped the raw chicken onto it, and it covered very well.  I didn't need to coat the chicken in egg or water or anything, the seasoning stuck very well.<br /><br />As for taste, it was very good.  Interestingly, it tasted slightly similar to Old Bay, so I tried it on some Tilapia and that was good, too!"
Trader Joe's Pomegranate White tea is superior to this tea. This is very bitter and perfumey. Maybe thats what you get when you brew whole leaves and stems . I found it repulsive.
"Oh My God!<br />I bought this tea as I've read many good reviws, but when I recieved it I was very dissapointed...<br />It was the worst tea what I've ever drunk..."
"This is my favorite breakfast coffee. Very smooth, no bitterness at all. I would rather have a cup of this than a to strong cup of starbucks."
"My husband loves Hazelnut coffee but the price of flavored coffee is so high, I used to only give it to him once a week, but now I can afford to give him his favorite everyday! He loves the rich flavor!"
"Love these individual creamers for morning coffee! I'm not normally a coffee drinker (I think it's too bitter), and don't want to add too much sugar, so this is the perfect alternative to give it a creamy consistency and sweet flavor. Highly recommended for anyone who may be a first time coffee drinker who likes the taste of sweet french vanilla."
"I like to support companies who strive harder to help the earth.  Newman's Own Organic French Roast Coffee is fair-trade organic coffee.  That means the coffee farmers are compensated fairly and the coffee is certified organic, which is better for us and the earth.<br /><br />FLAVOR:<br />This is a dark roast coffee, but it doesn't taste overly dark.  It has no bitterness, which is great, and is fairly smooth.  It lacks the complexity in flavor that other coffees can have, but it still tastes good.  It's a nice cup of coffee, and even if you don't care for dark roast, you may find you like this one.<br /><br />I drink my coffee black, and this is a great coffee to do so.  However, adding flavored creamers would also taste pretty good.  Sometimes I add ground cinnamon to the coffee grounds in the basket, so it brews into the coffee.  That yields a nice, mild cinnamon flavor to the coffee.<br /><br />AROMA:<br />The aroma coming from brewing this coffee is very tantalizing.  It is warm and almost has a sweet scent to it.<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />The bag folds up and has a couple of arms which fold around the sides to keep it closed.  It stays pretty fresh that way.<br /><br />OVERALL OPINION:<br />I find this to be one of my lesser favorites in the coffee world, but it is still a good one.  If you desire to work towards dark roast coffees, this would be a good one to start with.  Or, if you desire a milder dark roast, again, a good one here."
"i bought this item to get miso soup with less sodium.  imagine my surprise when it has more sodium than the ""regular kind"" of miso soup.<br />i don't think i'll get it again..."
I had high expectations but it was extremely salty and tasted nothing like movie theater popcorn. Next time I try popping it ( I do have 23 more packs to go through) I'll try cutting back on the salt in the packet. I don't know how this popcorn got such ratings. I'll give it another shot though out of the love I have for popcorn.
"The lavender flavor is not found everywhere, and works well in tea or coffee.<br />I like to add true vanilla extract as a base flavor."
"A great way to get this product if you like them.  I love their flavor, crunch and heat! By getting them in a bulk order, I have plenty to share. I have introduced them to several friends, who also enjoy them."
Bengal spice is just perfect either for Ice tea or for hot tea! Also it make the Chai latte special! Thanks!
"I love these crackers, but recently ordered a case for my daughter's baby shower - Out of 6 boxes I got about 24 whole crackers - the rest were broken, most were crumbs. Very disappointing."
"I think these are a good treat for mid-size dogs. High quality, organic ingredients.<br /><br />They are hard, so probably not suitable for small dogs, but they're also not very big. Our Newfoundland could eat several of these at once.<br /><br />I was a little surprised that she ate them at all. She's eaten a quality grain-free dog food (origen) and vegetables her entire life and usually turns her nose up anytime someone offers her a ""treat"". In the end though, we're both probably happier sticking to her normal food, so I won't be ordering any more of these."
My dog loves em. This is cheapest you will find these anywhere! This is my second time ordering great deal!
"A friend of mine who has acid reflux cannot drink coffee. So when this was offered, I decided to get it and have my friend try it. Well, low and behold, she liked it without any ramifications concerning her reflux. If she had any complaints, it would be that the French Roast flavor was a little on the strong side. I am sure that could be adjusted with coffee to water ratio, but that was one of her complaints. That aside, she was quite hyper afterwards, which she liked the energy it gave her (at first), but then started to have the shakes (but this is probably due to lack of caffeine for some time). I dont know if there is lots of caffeine packed into it or she just made an unreasonably strong cup of coffee. Her words were ""it has very good flavor and a very robust coffee"".  I don't think she is a convert to this particular flavor, but if she found ""regular"" coffee, she would get it, but found French Roast a little too strong for her liking."
just had to issue a review asap.  just got my first order in the mail.  product packaged perfectly and arrived intact and not a dent anywhere.  it seems earlier reviews must have been heard by amazon b/c my packaging/product was terrific.  i have been trying to locate this item at an affordable price since a local organic grocer went out of business.  im in heaven.  the taste is terrific and now with subscribe and save i can get a regular supply and free shipping!!  totally healthy natural product that i use for all family (including my pets).  one more reason to love amazon!<br />!
"We have been using this product for over a year now and that should speak volumes because we are a popcorn loving bunch!  The convenience of having everything measured and ready to go at a minute's notice is great.  I have a popcorn machine in the media room and so we love to munch popcorn while watching movies.....we feel we are at a theater eating the ""real deal"".  I will continue to purchase even though it isn't the most figure friendly popcorn....taste outweighs the waist....tee-he."
I have been brewing this beer off and on for the past five years along with many others. When it comes time to pour a glass it has never let me down. Even without using lagering methods it always develops into a a tasty drink.
"Upon opening the package I thought that the tea had absolutely no aroma and looked old as if it was sitting somewhere in an open container for months.  After brewing, it revealed a bland taste at best.  It was like drinking brewed hay.  I checked the expiration date which is two years from now.  Maybe I had a bad batch but it's going back.  I had a better experience with Rishi Organic Jasmine Pearl Loose Leaf Tea.  I do not recommend this tea to anyone."
"Odense almond paste produces wonderful cookies, pies, tarts etc.  The paste removes completely from its inside wrapper.<br /><br />Baked product is as good as any professional bakery and recipes are easy.<br /><br />Six pack is a great buy!"
"I was really rooting for this toy to work out, because my Frenchie Tobias loves playing with plastic bottles and he loves treats. The Tug a jug should be the perfect combo, right? The one I purchased had the rope, not the rubber thing. In theory, when you tip the toy treats should fall out relatively easily, according to various instructions and videos I found through internet searches. But even with small kibble, it is extremely difficult to get any treats out of the toy. Poor Tobias was quite frustrated. I helped him out by holding onto the bottle so that he could tug on the rope. He pulled quite hard for a good five minutes, after which one piece of kibble fell out.<br /><br />He's actually quite clever, and he's extremely food motivated. I don't know if something was wrong with this particular Tug a jug, that it was so difficult to get the treats out, but it's definitely not working out.<br /><br />I only give two stars because he did not destroy it, although he was throwing it around and chomping on the bottle part. He did leave scratches all over it, but hasn't yet managed to crack it. However, I think it's only a matter of time."
"When the case arrives, my kids do the POPchips dance! Love this flavor best of all. Everyone at home and work devour the case in a matter of days!"
"I wouldn't go so far to say this cereal is bad for you, but with the amount of added sugar it isn't great. I suppose that is the only way you can make bran appealing to the masses though. Bran is the nutritious cardboard part of a wheat grain. I personally would like to see them reduce the added sugar and add more raisins for a natural sweetness. As far a a amazon rating though it is, in my opinion, a good (not great) tasting cereal and has a good bit or fiber and protein. Also it's price is great for to the door delivery and you don't have to wait for it to go on sale at your local grocery store."
"This tray is huge, bulky, and awkward in the freezer.  It makes 2 oz portions, which are fine if you want to feed your baby 2 ounces of the same food, but I like to combine one ounce of this with one ounce of that.  Also, the cubes are fairly impossible to pop out of the tray.  You can run it under hot water as other users have done, but that makes a big wet avocado-ey mess.  I prefer to use regular ice cube trays with some saran wrap on top!"
I was so hoping she would like this because it is so healthy and would be easy to take camping and out to dinner...but she wouldn't eat any of it and kept spitting it out. I gave it to the dogs and they loved it and I am sure it is healthy for them!
"The only flavor we could stand was the barbecue (which was the reason we purchased them in the first place)!  I had to give the others away!!!  I won't be buying this again for lunches although the size/packaging was great.  I just wish the other flavors tasted better (plain, salt, pepper, etc., weren't really kid-friendly)."
I have bought this sampler in the stores for years.  Amazon had a great bulk price.  You can not go wrong with the variety.
"The DisposaKups work as advertised.  They are easy to use, just put your favorite coffee in the cup, pop the cap on and brew.  This allows me to save quite a bit of money while using my favorite coffee.  I filled about 25 of them at one time so there is always one standing by when I am desperate for a cup.  There is no need to wash out a filter, just toss it in the trash like the store bought K-cups.  They also make a good backup system if you run out of the store bought k-kups.<br />I would be interested to know if the company uses, or plans to use, recycled plastic or plastic alternatives in the manufacturing of these."
"We liked the ease of use.  Having all the spices/incredients in one pouch is handy.  The pork was juicy.  The taste was just okay.  Not great, not bad.  I've never been a big Shake N Bake fan, so it may just be my taste."
"I will no longer consider buying product from Kelloggs for the following reason:<br />Kelloggs continues to include GMO (genetically modified organism) ingredients in their products but refuses to include that information on their product labels.  There are no long term studied to prove that GMOs are safe for either human or animal consumption.  Kelloggs/ position is that GMOs are deemed safe by the FDA so they are not required to be identified to consumers.  However, Michael Taylor, head of the FDA, is a former attorney for Monsanto, the chemical company responsible for the development and wide spread use of GMOs in the American food supply, illustrating a conflict of interest that prevents the FDA from acting responsibly.  It's interesting to note that 50 other countries around the world have banned GMOs from their food supply all together but consumers here in the United States do not even have the right to be informed when GMOs are present in the products we buy.  Kelloggs is an unacceptable choice as long as they refuse to fully disclose the true nature of their ingredients to consumers."
excellent product....bag expands like popcorn..chowed a bag during avatar the the other night and fell like i was at the movies
"The seeds are fresh, the shells are hard and the seeds are JUMBO sized.  The taste is good, but the over-powering amount of salt ruins the experience.  The 'ranch' flavor would be much tastier if the salt used were lessened.  Then again, without the overwhelming amount of salt, David might have to use a bit more of the flavor for which you are actually paying.  By the way, I don't often find items too salty, but this borders on the ridiculous, IMO.  I wholeheartedly endorse the Jumbo size seeds, as they are MUCH more enjoyable than the puny 'regular' sized sunflower seeds by David.<br /><br />I will be buying another brand of sunflower seeds in the future, hoping that it will not have the amount of salt the David's have.<br /><br />Update: I finished all but a little of the case of David buffalo ranch flavored seeds and bought a case of the Jumbo brand ranch flavored sunflower seeds.  I compared them back-to-back.  The Jumbo brand is far less salty and flavorful compared to David's.  It will be interesting how I will find the Jumbo brand to be after eating them for awhile.  Right now, they seem a bit 'under-flavored'.  Still, that is preferable to David's overuse of salt."
"I love these chips, I buy the 24 pack once a month. The bags are just the right size for snacking and prevent me from eating way too much with the larger bags. The jalapeno spice is subtle enough not to be overpowering but still gives you a great amount of flavor."
"These chips are really good. They taste better than other name brands. They're cheaper too!!  They aren't too salty like other brands. The flavors blend really well. Just the right amount of sour cream and onion flavor with a little salt mixed in. Once I start eating them, it's hard to stop!! LOL<br /><br />I will definitely be buying these potato chips rather than another name brand. Not sure if I can state the name brand or not. :)"
"This cookie mix isn't just the best gluten-free mix, it's the best chocolate chip cookie I've ever had.  Easy to make, they bake in no time and make a perfect cookie everytime.  I will choose these over a homemade variety without question."
"After speaking to other mothers, we skipped rice cereal and went straight to oat cereal.  I found that the consistency of happy bellies oat cereal is much better than earth's best.  Also the containers are really convenient, rather than the cardboard box of earth's best."
"Supposed to be for cleaning their teeth - right...  well - that would assume they held up to some for of chewing...  our little Border TERRIER (not Collie) ""eats"" one of these in about 5 minutes...  too fast to be of any use to the teeth and almost too fast to cause concern in the digestive tract.  Bummer too because these are supposed to be great for pups teeth...  just an agressive chewer defeats Greenie...  that's all."
These are the best chocolate fudge cookies commercially available.  And the price is way below what you would have to pay at the grocers.
"While you can make your own chai tea, it does take some work to gather all the spices and then steep them in milk. The Oregon Chai tea mixes are rather easy to use. You can either make regular tea and add the packet like you would milk and spices or you can serve this with hot milk or even just water.<br /><br />If you are looking for a very creamy version, you can make a 16-ounce cup of hot water in the microwave and then add one packet of Oregon Chai Tea Mix, 1 packet of hot chocolate and 2 Constant Comment tea bags. That is my favorite combination so far.<br /><br />While the tea bags are for an 8-ounce cup, I make a much larger cup of tea, so this is perfect to mix with a tea bag and more powdered milk.<br /><br />Ingredients: Sugar, dried whole milk, dried nonfat milk, natural flavors, dried honey, tapioca maltodextrin, decaffeinated dried black tea and salt. Yes, salt!<br /><br />Each packet is 100 calories.<br /><br />Also look for Ready-to-drink individual servings and liquid concentrates where you just add milk.<br /><br />If you are just using a packet of this mix and 8 ounces of water, you might still want to add some powdered milk to make it extra creamy. Whipped cream and nutmeg also make the drink more delicious.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review"
I love pink himalayan salt! It is loaded with minerals and taste great.  I don't have to use as much as the conventional table salt and I don't feel bad about using it because I know that it's also really good for my body.
"The pods arrived fresh and quickly after ordering them.  By ordering the coffee through the subcription program they are a good value.  The flavor is good, slightly bitter after taste to this brand of coffee."
"We love the taste of Illy coffees when brewed in our espresso machine-- smooth, never bitter. You cannot distinguish the flavor of the decaf from the flavor of the regular espresso.<br /><br />AIlly's vacuum-packed canister has a unique, design and is reusable."
"I have tried both the Tofu Shirataki and the Non Tofu Shirataki. The non-tofu variety is very gel/gummy (literally like little strands of flavorless gummy worms). I ate the non-tofu noodles, because, hey they are sooo low calorie/carb. But now that I've tried the tofu shirataki which contains only 20 calories per serving, I am sold on the tofu shirataki. Tofu noodles were more like ramen noodle consistency. Perhaps not the exact same texture as a real flour based noodle, but for the calories and carb content these are excellent!<br /><br />As with any shirataki noodle, you do have to make sure you wash, wash and wash them some more. If there is any scent at all, you have not washed them enough. About 2 or 3 minutes seems to do the trick for me. I made a low carb peach kugel (dessert) with the fettuccine and a stir fry with the angel hair. I just could not believe how much better they were than the non tofu variety.<br /><br />I was also very impressed with the seller (Low Carb You Foods). These arrived within 2 days on regular shipping, shipping all the way across the country. And, I bought 2 different varieties with no additional charge on the shipping! I will certainly be back again."
"Ever since first having McVitie's Digestives many, many years ago, I continue to maintain that they are the best. Nothing that compares to them in the States.  Awesome to find these available through Amazon.  I've bought digestives at Whole Foods...different brand, pretty expensive.  No comparison to the taste of McVitie's.  Love them with goat cheese.  In the UK, loved them with Cranberry Stilton.  Awesome, awesome, awesome.  Graham crackers?  No comparison.  You gotta try 'em."
I love walnuts so I thought I would save some money and buy them here in bulk. But what an unpleasant surprise. These were horribly stale and had a very distinctive bad bad bad BAD taste. I had been told that Emerald nuts were very good and maybe I just got a bad batch(of 6 canisters?? unlikely). But I will definitely never buy these again nor will I ever recommend them to anyone.
"This is a starchy soup rather than the meal portrayed on the outside.  There is very little taste and very little chicken.  It is mostly rice in a weak chicken stock thickened with potato and corn starch.<br /><br />It is not repulsively bad, if you want a light, convenient snack.<br /><br />The Chef Boyardee microwavable meals are tastier and more substantial, and also more convenient because you just have to pull off the lid, which comes away easily.  With these Hormel Compleats, you have to pierce the top first, and then peel it off afterwards, which is not so easy, especially as it is hot."
"The whole idea of a Spongebob Ginger Bread Pineapple is really great, but the sticker that says ""Use By"" Has a 10 JN 16 date on it. If thats 2010- this is not good! I think it would be fun to make and a cute decoration, but my son is going to want to eat it.  The least the seller could do is to check the expiration date! Its right on the front of the box! Not happy at all!!!"
"We love the little Venus Flytrap,<br />it's healthy, hungry, and producing new shoots.<br />It arrived quickly and in good condition.<br />Altogether a positive experience."
"I bought this for my active dog who won't eat rawhides.  I was afraid she wouldn't like the vanilla mint flavor, but it's a hit.  I also put some of her daily kibble in the large everlasting treat ball <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012V1G0Y"">StarMark Everlasting Treat Ball, Large</a>, which keeps her active but isn't an increase in her calorie intake.  Make sure you get a ball that's bigger than your dog's jaw so they can't bite the treat in half.  Overall very happy with this product."
"The coffee tastes like regular coffee!  It's good, not too weak.  I used a little less water than I do for my regular strength coffee.<br /><br />Taste is great, smell is better.  Whether it works for the stomach as needed, I am not sure.  Rizzo"
"Wow! is an understatement.  These are (by-far) the BEST barbecue potato chips on the market today -- and they don't have any non-food ""junk"" in them!  These chips taste like a cross between potato chips and barbecue pork rinds but they are low in fat and they are NOT fried!  They are really crunchy and we LOVE the barbecue seasoning that they use on these.  We're sold -- we won't be buying any of those ""other"" potato chips anymore. I've going to end this review now because I just heard one of my kids open up another bag..."
"I get these for the front desk at my office because customers love them. A couple were melted (i get into them myself, hehe). But who cares because they are the most delicious chocolates ever made!!"
I got what I ordered but these are NOT the big ones. They are about a foot long. I had to go out and buy the 2 foot long ones at about $1 each so these are reasonable value at $.50 each.
"This has been my favorite 'I need refreshment' drink for some time now.<br />The fact that is tastes great and is low in calories makes it even more<br />appealing. I keep a gallon container in the refridgerator at all times,<br />even during the winter.  Great product."
Spike is my secret weapon in the kitchen.  I've been using this for 30 years. I used to have to go to the health food stores and it is harder and harder to find.  Thank goodness for Amazon. You can find anything here!!!
"Annabelle (my three year old Persian mix) absolutely adores these. She does not like any other treats. These are perfect, because they're chewy, so they feel and taste different from her food. She does tricks for them and always comes running when we bring them out. Definitely try them. They are healthy (grain free) and perfect for any kitty! To the comment about the bag, just buy a treat jar. Works much better, and it looks cuter on your shelf or counter :)"
I always feel refreshed when I drink this coconut water. The pineapple gives it an added extra that makes it truly irresistible. It has been a firm favorite of mine now for nearly a year.
This is funny I bought the flax seed to make  a neck warmer  I made said to use Flax seed and warm in Microwave for 2 minutes.  Bought 4 bags only needed 2 so decided to make use of the rest. Grind and put over any food the benifits are great.<br />I put mine in Yogert and Cereal. Will diffently keep useing. After this last bag will be ording again.
"Our dog loves the taste of these treats.<br /><br />Pros - Taste...apparently. They appear to be healthy.<br />Cons - They are easily chewed through; thus, your dog will likely finish them quickly."
"EVERYTHING I ever wanted in coffee: Full-bodied rich flavor, low acid (I didn't even know this was possible) Organic,Free trade. I use Amazon's subscription delivery option (excellent service,even better price) and get 4 lbs monthly. It comes in whole bean only, keep in freezer then grind only enough at one time for my sealed cannister--EXCELLENT!! I've been enjoying coffee for 45 years and this is abosutely the best by every measure."
Got these for my son for school snacks.  Everyone loves them.  They're crunchy and sweet and cinnamon-y. The only ingredients are organic apples and cinnamon.
I used to buy Gerber baby foods and was thrilled when they started carrying organic foods. Then I discovered that they add gelatin! Why? It is disgusting and has absolutely no nutritional value.  I will not be buying Gerber products again. Earth's Best is actually organic.
"Popcorn is very delicious.  However, some of the packages have been very oily and thus make grasping them to put in my popcorn maker a task."
"I used this marinade exactly as the instructions say on the label.  I marinated two pounds of chicken breast, chopped up for couscous.  Now I will admit that the marinade smells amazing when you open the bottle, but it left me disappointed.  There is so much liquid smoke in this marinade, that my chicken ended up tasting like a chicken flavored ash tray.  Perhaps if I had used a smaller amount it would have worked out better?  I don't know.  I think perhaps the company needs to modify their cooking instructions."
Best chips I've ever eaten but you should sell them in 11 to 15 oz bags.
"I recently discovered Popchips and their greatness. So I have been trying them out flavor by flavor. The Chili Lime has is now my favorite. It had previously been the Salt & Pepper. It is def not too spicy, so don't let that scare you. If anything the lime is the highest note of flavor. If you already like Popchips, this is a new great flavor to try. If you have never tried them, then this is a great flavor to start with."
"The basic problem with this product is that unless you load a VERY small amount of coffee in the filter, the filter clogs.  This causes the coffee ground and hot water to back up through the hole in the top and cause a mess.  My son and I spent a few hours experimenting with different ways to prevent this but we have admitted defeat.  I suspected the filter but I used filters which work perfectly fine in my EZ Cup still result in a mess on my kitchen counter. Even worse, coffee grounds in my coffee!  However, if you like your coffee very weak, this will work well for you.  I hope they can fix the design issues.  Until then, I will stick with my EZ Cup."
We do a lot of bicycle riding in the heat and longer rides as well. We don't want to crash from lack of carbs in our system. Other energy products don't taste as good as these do. They are conveniently packed in little pouches so they are easy to grab and take along when we ride. Good stuff!
"Just off the phone with them (Aug/12) and they said that yes they stopped putting BPA in the liners in Oct/11. Of course there is old stock on the shelves so I asked how to tell whether the liners we have are the ""old"" (with BPA) or the ""new"" (without BPA) and the person there said to look at the inside the surface of the lid. If it is all white then it is BPA free - if it is metallic or gold then it's the ""old"" lids which did contain a BPA layer. Thought this might help some of you out there!"
"Shake N Bake is one of those products that has a limited market. While I like the crunch factor, it can be hard to keep the chicken from getting soggy on the bottom. It's really a glorified breading which is about as easy to make as boiling water. If you like it fine, but for me I'd rather make a dish from scratch."
"I could get very used to this!  This is a nice, strong, robust coffee without bitterness.  The K-Cups are so convenient and make no mess."
"I love tea...and I really hate writing bad reviews. Maybe I didn't make it right, but I've made other teas that came out just fine.<br />I've bought a bottled version of it from another brand and expected a similar taste out of this tea I bought today. I tasted nothing. I let it steep and steep and steep, taking sips ever so often to see if the flavor ever came out.<br /><br />I think the most disappointing thing about it is its box and smell. It's box describes it as ""pomegranate blueberry"" flavor. I tasted neither. It had such a seductive aroma, so much so, I could smell it while it was still packaged and I admit it was what persuaded me to buy it.<br /><br />I let my mother try it, and she described it perfectly:  even though it had a lovely aroma, it wasn't flavoring the water.<br />I noticed that there was an ""apple-y"" after taste at least. Lipton's just needs to step it up and make it a bit stronger so you can actually taste it. I don't know if it is because I have a natural affinity for stronger tea, or what, but I cannot begin with how disappointed I was, especially for the price I paid in store. If a tea has a fruit flavor added, I want to taste the fruit. I would rather it have a robust, full-bodied flavor. Or at least put on the label that it's a milder tea.<br /><br />For the rest of the people who put excellent reviews, do tell what you did to make it taste so good. I find that it is sweet smelling water and nothing more."
"This is my second favorite after the breakfast in bed flavor. I love Wolfgang Puck coffee. It's a little bolder then the breakfast in bed, but still smooth."
"These dried strawberries do taste good - indeed, they're addictive.  When I eat one, I usually end up eating several more.  But they're too sweet.  The sugary taste and texture of this brand of dried strawberries makes me feel like I'm eating candied strawberries.  This wasn't what I expected from the description.  I should have paid more attention to the other review that complains of over-sweetening.  Don't buy these, unless you want to eat strawberry candy; buy another brand which lets you enjoy the natural strawberry flavor and texture more."
"Loved the original!  Hate this new recipe.  It was fine to have alternative recipes - weight control (BS BTW), less sugar.  But, to make the alternative the only option a consumer can buy??? Horrible decision and even worse product.  I could not even eat one bowl of this mess.  it is so far off the mark that I would rather go hungry than attempt to eat this crap!  My dog could make a better batch of oatmeal with some kibbles and her butt!  This product is a disgrace and should be taken off the store shelves - never allowed to return!"
I was relatively unimpressed as well as disappointed given the product was melted and many of the pieces were damaged upon delivery.
"You should monitor your dog very carefully if you give him/her these chews. One of our dogs died as a result of eating these chews, and the other three were very ill for two days. This product is very difficult for dogs to digest and can result in blocked intestines and infection. Since the package did not contain any warnings, we thought they were harmless. Be very careful if you buy these for your dog."
"I have no idea how these people sleep at night!! I pay $1.68 for these mints at Wal-Mart. When I saw these on amazon, for $12 somthing I asumed this price was for a case. This seemed like a money saving deal to me even including shipping. I ordered 2 thinking it was 2 cases and the total was $32 and change. They arived a few days later and it was 2 6OZ BAGS!!!!!!!!!!!! For $32  dollars I got 12 oz of mints! How in the hell can they screw people like this and live with themselves? Who would pay over $12 for 6 oz of peppermints??? My dumb ass I guess, but it wont happen again because I won't be buying anything else, ever again from these theives. I suggest you dont either!!!!!!!!!!"
"This is a new treat for our ""kids"". They are pretty picky eaters, especially my girl! They both love 'em. Glad I found this product. Reasonably priced too"
"Low calorie, its true. Try other flavors not Salt & Vinegar.  Wish I could return them, but we ate 2.  Or at least tried to, yuck!"
"I have a special needs pet and searched for the right food.  Since Amazon has been a five star resource I chose to have Pot Pie shipped. Many of the cans are dented.  So I have to toss them or return. This is a big hassle but would not ever feed a dented can to my beloved boy.  Best to purchase at the pet store, evidently."
"Yes, people will like Pamela's gluten free bread mix.  I did too BUT do the math on the very high amount to sweetener in this mix.  9 grams per slice (based on their stated 16 slices per loaf)!  This is 144 grams for the loaf which comes to 1 1/4 cups of sweetener.  As you know that's 15 tablespoons in the mix (approximately) so compare that to your favorite recipes.  I see no one else coming even close to this in mixes or recipes.  I can't think of any reason they are doing this except for taste - to make it more sellable.  Just a heads up since we need to be cutting back on sugars not ramping up.<br /><br />:-)"
"I Love Basmati rice and to get the Organic is the Best.  This product is great tasting and the aroma was amazing!  The only reason that I won't purchase it again is:  the amount in the package is very little and for as much as I steam rice (for not only my kids and me but our French bulldogs) it is just Not enough for the price you have to pay.  Way too expensive.  So, I go to Vitamin Cottage and get the Ludenburg Organic Brown Basmati rice in a 2 lb bag for 4.45...great deal and great product!"
"Everyone seems to enjoy these so I think maybe I'm missing something.  I microwaved them for slightly less time than instructed and only about 1/5 of them changed consistency from the little flat parallelograms to a slightly puffier flat paralleogram.  Next batch I did a little longer and a couple more of them puffed up a little bit.  Even the puffy ones seem to have patches of tremendously hardened pork(don't laugh) in them to a point where when you eat one and there are pork rind shards that break away from the puffy.  I tried one last time and microwaved them for a minute and a half longer than instructed and this time the puffy ones overcooked and burned and the others stayed in tiny, hard form(again, don't laugh).<br /><br />If anyone that orders these and learns any tips that I might be missing, please let me know. They will be in their resealable package in the pantry until that point or they expire.<br /><br />Thanks."
This chocolate is the best thing ever - made my dad really happy to get a shipment of these for Father's Day
"Flavor 5 STARS:  First time I used the oil I poured some in a saute pan to scramble some eggs. It ended up being an earthy mushroom like flavor. I loved it.  I pour it on my dogs food occasionally and they love it.  I wanted to buy this originally because I watched the Dr. OZ tv show and he recommended ingesting a little every day for its anti-inflammatory properties.  I gave some oil to my Aunt who has an auto-immune disease and she likes the oil as well. I would definitely buy this product again.<br /><br />Ding for metal alloy container: It is cheap metal and though it was packaged well by Amazon.com the containers probably got dented in Amazon's warehouse because it didn't seem like the packaging should have caused the dents.  The way it was packaged if there was any damage it would probably only be dents to the containers so I would say ""expect"" dents with any shipment of oils if this company uses the same cheaper kind of metal alloy for their containers.  Dents do not make the product taste worse so I do not worry about the taste.  I will return it if the containers leak but that would not stop me from ordering again.  However, the odds of leaking happening probably statistically is not ""often"" if you receive shipments regularly."
I was impressed. It smells like peanut butter & has the same consistency as peanut butter. It really doesnt have much taste to it. The chocolate pb2 doesnt either. Theres a slight taste of peanut butter but I'm not sure if I'm tasting it or just smelling it. I love it cause it offers a protein without all the calories. Btw the calories as well as other values are identical in the plain & the chocolate. The real challenge is finding something to eat it on. Better on a cracker than bread. Best on toast
"Our local grocery stores no longer carry Tobasco Ketchup, so went out to the internet and found it on Amazon.  I don't use ketchup all the time for everything, but when I do, I like it spicy.  Good stuff.  I don't know why our local grocers do not carry it any more.  This seller delivered the product in a timely manner as well."
"Unless you like LOTS of rosemary, then you should NOT purchase this item.  If you can't make a better seasoning blend on-your-own, then I would HIGHLY recommend you purchase a good cookbook like the Joy of Cooking, and go from there.<br /><br />YUCK!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743246268"">Joy of Cooking: 75th Anniversary Edition - 2006</a>"
The quality of this tea is 5 star-it is in sealed bags. We're trying it out to see if helps our nails & skin.
"Absolutely amazing! This gravy wins over any other hands down for that good ole down home country taste!<br /><br />My neighbor & I frequently eat meals together. Yesterday I slow-cooked pork chops in about 3 cups of water, with diced potatoes, onion, pepper, frozen speckled butter beans, & parsley, sage & a can of cream of chicken soup for seasoning. She made mashed potatoes & after removing the pork chops, added a pack of this gravy mix to the sauce right in with the beans & diced potatoes for a lovely rich gravy. I don't recall a meal like it since my grandmother's house! We saved the leftover gravy, and tonight we're cooking chicken & corn to serve with it!<br /><br />I now have this saved so we can keep ourselves in gravy heaven! Thank you Amazon.com for carrying this & Southeastern Mills for a quality, reasonably priced, fantastic gravy!"
"No harsh after taste, no tangible negatives.  It just doesn't have the ""bite"" that I crave from other carbonated beverages like ginger ale or root beer.  It's a good option for a healthful drink with some fizz."
"Our dogs adore these and they are usually fairly pricey for the amount you get. However Amazon always has one great deal or another for buying these and significantly cheaper than in store prices.<br /><br />We usually buy the 130 or 96 pack of 'Teenies' for our two chihuahua mix dogs (depending whichever has the better sale price at the time.<br /><br />The teenie size is great for our smaller dog (6lb) as he can fully chew on it and savor it. However it is not quite enough for our other chihuahua mix (13lb) she tends to gulp it down like any other dog treat without getting as much benefit from the dental cleaning that Greenies are supposed to help with. Now that she is a little larger (she loved these as a pup) I think we may 'graduate' her to the next size of Greenie.<br /><br />I have always found that our dogs look forward to their Greenie treats and see them as a special treat which is great because keeping a dogs dental health in check is important and I find Greenies do help with this and yet are delicious to the dog.<br /><br />Our larger dog has been given Greenies for two years now and her teeth are still almost entirely stain free and her breath is not as bad as some dogs. However I would not use Greenies solely to keep a dogs breath in check, I recommend getting some other product for that."
"I bought the Buffalo Bills Teriyaki Ole' Smokies beef sticks because I absolutely LOVE beef sticks, especially teriyaki, and I thought this would be a good buy - good quantity for the price.<br /><br />The teriyaki beef sticks themselves were very tasty and flavorful. I also loved the texture, it was very soft and tender.<br /><br />The only bad thing I'd have to say about this product is that it leaves me with a very greasy, fatty residue all over the rood of my mouth, which kind of takes away from the flavor and my ability to FULLY enjoy the product. Aside from that, I may still order it again. :)"
"It did not really taste like much, so I was able to add sauce without interrupting the flavor, however I could not get past the texture. I'd rather chew on rubber bands."
Of all the different types of Chai that I have tried this is by far my very favorite.  I have been ordering it for years and will continue to do so.
"I loved it! Good taste, pleasant carbonation, fun can.<br /><br />If you don't like Kiwi or Berry, then you may not like the taste.  My wife didn't care for it, but I really liked it! Ok, so all it is is carbonated fruit juice.... big deal, right? But it actually is a big deal if you are a soda junky and want to cut down on the negative effects without losing all the experience. I hate diet soda because it just doesn't taste right and has way too many synthetic chemicals in it. However, this drink has no sugar, corn syrup, or preservatives. I suppose the CO2 may not be the best for you, but you gotta live a little."
I too have had tons of gnats come out of the potting soil.  Didn't they sterilize soil in the past?  I bought it to make grow grass seeds for the cats to chew on.I would spray it with bug spray but for the fact that I don't want to poison the cats. I've had some of the soil in planter for 2 months and its still making gnats.  I didn't have that problem with the soil that came with the Chia novelty cat grass seeds and soil.  The Miracle potting mix has a lot of wood chips in it.  I would prefer 100% soil instead of 25% wood chips that cause the gnats.  I guess Potting Mix is different than Potting soil.  I used to sell New Era potting soil that was good dark earth with nothing else added to it. Live and learn.
"I drink am a frequent coffee drinker - at least a couple of cups a day.  So I was glad to see this product available.  I often switch between light roast and dark roast coffee - depends on time of day, my mood, and availably.  I like to enjoy a good Dark French Roast at night.  I made a pot of this for my husband and me to try.  We were not impressed - it had a strong odor, and a very bitter after taste (neither of us finished our cup).  As far as the impact of the low acid - we couldn't judge since we didn't drink enough."
"Owned two of these and when they work they are fine.  The power knob has no indicator on it though.  My biggest problem, and the reason I will NEVER purchase another, is this: both gave out with in a year.  One now sounds like I am recording from behind a wall and one developed a hum that will not go away.  Do yourself a favor and find a more reliable option."
"My dog loves these treats. He's really picking with his treats so it says a lot that he loves these. I had been buying him bags of the freeze dried treats at petco, etc. and it was costing a fortune, not to mention they were smashed. These are great quality. You get tons!! in the 14 ounce bucket and my little dog is in love."
"Coconut Water with a splash of Pineapple<br /><br />This is refreshing!  It's sweet, but not too sweet.  The coconut flavor isn't pronounced, and the pineapple isn't so overpowering that it tastes like syrup.  It's clean tasting.  According to the packaging, ""it has five essential electrolytes, more potassium than a banana, no fat, no cholesterol, and no preservatives.""  There's a smidge of fiber, 0.8 g of protein and 16 g of sugars.  I suspect most of the sugar comes from the pineapple, but ""cane juice"" is one of the ingredients, too. The 8.5 fl oz carton comes to 75 calories.<br /><br />If you sign up for subscribe & save, it's less than $1 per carton.  Actually, the carton is the only thing I don't like about this drink.  It's sort of hard to drink directly from because there isn't any air getting let in when you drink, which makes a vacuum.  This was solved by pouring it into a glass.  *whew*<br /><br />This was good.  I will definitely get more, and I highly recommend this to people who like pineapple juice."
"My mom is a diabetic and she has a few of these a week. I am reviewing the Nut Delights ones without the fruit. They're all natural, gluten free, wheat free, dairy free, low-GI value. They do have 12 carbs, 3 grams of fiber and 8 grams of sugar. We used to make a recipe similar to these, but these come out cheaper and better tasting."
"My wife and I wanted to get a gift basket like this for her father for Christmas.  We weren't going to be able to visit in person this year and enjoy Christmas morning breakfast and thought a gift basket would be nice.  After researching tons of options I became frustrated that so often the shipping on products like this cost more than the actual products themselves.  Let's face it, a pre-arranged gift basket of food is rarely going to be a ""value"".  But when you add in shipping these things can be down right outrageous.  We came across this basket and it was available with Amazon Prime free shipping.  Not only that, it was less expensive than other alternatives we were looking at (some from other non-Amazon vendors).  We went ahead and ordered this.  It arrived exactly on time in excellent condition and, according to my father-in-law, it was excellent.  I have no complaints and was happy to find this option.  I was pleased with the company and Amazon.  Hopefully it remains ""prime-eligible"" in the future."
"I don't know the deal is here but they are terrible.  I love Cracker Jacks and not just cause there is a prize, especially now that the prizes are pointless compared to what you use to get.<br /><br />These arrived and the first box I ate seemed very stale, checked the date and was not expired and the date was a long ways away so I figured maybe it was that box.  But I'm a few boxes in now and they are all the same it's like chewing on cardboard.  I event went to the local 7-11 to get some to compare and those at 7-11 were 1000 timex better.<br /><br />Since it was so cheap to get them it's not worth the hassle to send them back so I think I'll just give them out for halloween."
"Honestly, I'm not sure why so many folks like this coffee in their reviews.  It's a little weak but mostly just doesn't have a rich flavor.  It is really missing something.  I drink coffee black.  Maybe it tastes better with cream and sugar?  Before buying this coffee, I had been drinking Starbuck's French Roast and Folger's Black Silk, both of which taste SO MUCH better than this coffee."
"This is a great product, we have made custard with it for years and it always makes great custard. We will purchase this product again. Amazon does a great job of getting us our purchases fast and without damage."
"I've drunk a lot of coffee in the last fifty years and this is the absolute worst ever! Nothing I've had ever had comes close to how awful this stuff is. This has no taste and is very bitter, actually it does tastes worse than some mud I've eaten as a young child. What a waste of money,as I am not allowed to return the unopened bags, all three will go into the trash! When I say I'm pretty disappointed in this purchase I'm being kind.<br />Don't buy this or you will be 'bitterly' disappointed!"
"""No Sugar Added""<br />""No Preservatives""<br />""100% Juice Carbonated""<br />""All Natural""<br /><br />But it tastes just like soda . . .<br /><br />If you are a soda-lovers, but want a healthier alternative, this may be just the ticket. It's an especially great product for kids, because they really think they are getting soda, but without all the added sugars!"
I tried a double boxes of this when the Donut Shop  coffee I usually order was unavailable.  While the coffee is pretty good the cups suck.  A full 1/3 of the cups brewed are undrinkable.  They are slow to brew(coffee maker has to work very hard) and even then the cup retains an inordinate amount of water.  Checking some of the cups that left grounds in the brew showed that the filter was not properly installed.  They could sell these at half the price listed and you still would pay too much due to all the wasted coffee.  I believe we all have experienced a defective cup here or there but these are way beyond acceptable.
"BEWARE the changing descriptions here in Amazon folks...when I first viewed this item, admittedly a convenient item to have in the pantry for a snowy day, the descriptions was for THIRTY-TWO (32) 1 quart (32-oz) cartons for around $33...NOT 12 cartons as the description NOW reads. I thought a dollar per carton was a pretty good price, but I NEVER would have ordered it at almost 3 dollars a carton...that's highway robbery.<br /><br />I am going to complain to Amazon, don't expect to get any satisfaction, but will try anyway.<br /><br />So be careful: anytime something here in Amazon sounds too good to be true it probably is."
"I love this stuff. It's a quick, easy breakfast and stays with me long then dry cereal. The sweetness is just right. We always have it in the house, and it is great when traveling--camping, hotels, etc. Especially camping. Heat the water on the fire (or propane stove) and you've got a yummy hot breakfast to get you going. Love this stuff!"
"I have tried other low acid coffees such as Ola's and really enjoyed the taste.  Not the case with Puroast.<br /><br />First, the smell upon opening the bag of Puroast dark French roast was underwhelming to say the least.  It was nothing that I could attach an adjective like ""rich"" or ""inviting"" to but rather made me think ""what an odd aroma for coffee.""  Not a good start.<br /><br />The quantity in the bag seemed small in the filter so I brewed with 10 cups of water and not 12.  I think it was a good choice because I could still see too much light through the brewed coffee for my taste.  And speaking of taste, I found this coffee to have an ash like character.  Not rich, smoky or full bodied like I anticipate a French roast to be.  The aftertaste is unpleasant and really lingers.  Overall, not a good coffee experience.<br /><br />Because taste is subjective, I will mention what coffee I find tasty so you can get an idea of what the other end of the spectrum from Puroast is for me.  Peet's Major Dickason's and Ola's Organic Uganda Bugisu are two of my favorites."
This tea is fantastic.  The main flavor is licorice - with other herbal undertones and it is my favorite tea of all.  I had to buy the six pack because I run through a single pack so fast.
"This was the 2nd time that I ordered the Smokehouse USA Chicken Stix. The 1st order had USA printed right on the bag, this one had a USA sticker over the China sticker.  In addition, the product looked entirely different. Obviously I am concerned. I pay more to ensure I am not feeding my ""fur kids"" products from China. If it happens again, I'll stop ordering all Smokehouse products on-line."
"Product arrived on time, nicely packaged and gift wrapped, the treats were all quality and very good.  Nice keepsake box."
Delighted with my first ever Irish Oats/Steel Cut.  As a Diabetic this should help me with my blood sugar -- natural carb with a slow release!<br /><br />Cook up a batch in the slow cooker and use left overs (microwave) for a couple of days.  Great . . . will be purchasing more.<br /><br />Thanks McCann's and Amazon.
"I bought this extract to use in a pumpkin beer, but I would have ruined the batch. This stuff is gross!"
My dogs beg for these treats every night after dinner.  I always make sure I have plenty of supply at hand.
"The cans are listed as 13 fluid ounces each, but I measured and each can was 12 ounces or less.  Since you have to have equal parts water and formula, I had to carefully measure each can.  Each can was different.  The formula itself worked fine, but it was misleading as to how much I was actually getting for the price.  The already mixed formula is much cheaper per ounce than this or even the powder."
"The consistency of the grain free chicken, turkey, lamb and fish formula was like<br />baby poop.  There was so much water in this cat food that two cats went through a<br />full case in a short time.  I can put the water in the cat food.  It is misleading<br />and a poor value for the manufacturer to water down a product, call it a 13 oz can<br />and provide nothing like I have come to know and expect from other brands the same<br />size."
"My wife has Celiac Sprue which is a Allergy to Gluten in certain grains. She was diagnosed with this disease about 8 years ago. When she was first diagnosed, we could only purchase Gluten Free products from health food stores and it was very expensive. As awareness about this disease has spread more companies are offering Gluten free products. In our search we stumbled across Pamela's. My wife fell instantly in love with it. The pancakes made from this flour are indistinguishable from wheat flour. We made the jump and now the whole family is eating Pamela's. To purchase it at the store is rather expensive. Did a web search and found it reasonably priced at Amazon. We will continue to purchase Pamela's in bulk until it is no longer offered. Great Pancakes!"
"For the price you pay, the pods should make a good cup of coffee. This coffee was watery and bland.  Don't buy. I think Tulley's is the best."
"I bought this product because it was listed as the coffee capsules for the Nespresso coffee maker.  It wasn't!  The capsules were too big.  When I contacted Amazon they told me I couldn't return the product, but gave me a partial refund. (Okay)  When I told them they were advertising for the wrong coffee maker, they said I could contact the manufacturer. These capsules are probably great, for the right coffee maker, but not I'm not happy that I was mislead."
I love raisin bran and have tried most brands but always come back to Kellog's. Flackes are crispy and good and there are tons of large raisins.
"Amazon doesn't accept returns of food items, so I'm using this product as dog treats. Very expensive dog treats. Enough said. :-("
I am a peanut butter addict and I absolutely love using this in my daily protein shakes. Flavor is delicious and it is more than half the calories and fat. What more can you ask for?! Awesome healthier alternative. I have not tried it in a sandwhich yet though.
Ordered Galil Roasted Chestnuts after watching a Dr Oz show.  We expected that the word roasted was referring to something similar to dry roasted.  Instead we found that they are a wet soft mushy nut.  Horrible tasting. We couldn't eat even one complete nut much less 24 pouches. Strongly would recommend that all future buyers beware of trying something in quantity that you have not tried before.
Being what you would call a chip connoisseur was looking forward to trying these.  Great chips.
"This is the first time I have tried an organic maple syrup.  Being a Grade A Dark Amber already promised great taste, but being organic added to the expectations.  The product has surpassed what I expected, with the warm, mellow taste that reminds me of northern woods, campfires, and the tingle of frost in the air.  After being raised on the authentic flavor of real maple syrup, artificial syrups are a big disappointment; this product enlivened the taste of my Saturday morning pancakes."
"The nose evokes the earthiness of white truffles, just barely.  The white truffle presence in Bartolini is weak with mineral (almost chemical) notes, not the earthy, warm and almost intoxicating fragrance you expect from white truffles.<br /><br />There is no such thing as white truffles (oil or otherwise) on a budget.  The real thing is expensive, a deserving price for the experience you expect."
This candy is not as described. The middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as described.<br />Looks and tastes like it's way past it's expiration date.<br />Would never reccommend this. Paid a good chunk of cash for nothing
"My partner and I tried this coffee this morning. I'm usually skeptical about most advertising claims, so I wasn't expecting much from this coffee, but I have to say it's great.  We both suffer from acid reflux, and had put the coffee maker away because we just couldn't drink it anymore. So we were both thrilled with this coffee.  No acid reflux, and the taste was wonderful.  Very pleased, and the coffee maker will stay out on the counter from now on!"
"I would say it doesn't taste 100% like regular peanut butter, but its definitely a great substitute! Can't wait to try it in recipes. I tried another reviewer's tip to add a little jelly for a classic PB&J spread - it was amazing!"
"I bought the vanilla beans to make DIY vanilla extract. I do alot of baking and I like to use good vanilla. The recipe requires moist, full vanilla beans and these were wonderful.The vanilla beans came in a vacuum pack that kept them in very good condition, much better than buying them from the spice section of the grocery store where the jar contains 2 to 3 dehydrated beans. And they made great vanilla extract for much less money than buying the 'real' vanilla at the store."
I drink a lot of coffee and I buy several different types. I found this particular one to be pleasant tasting with a nice aroma while brewing. There is no after-taste so you always want another cup.
I discovered the HappyBellies at Babies R Us and didn't know anything about it. (btw it is more expensive there) We started our baby on it in 4 months. She LOVES it and it is good for her belly. She used to be constipated from time to time even on the breast milk. Now she is much more regular. Once i could not find the HappyBellies rice cereal at the store and got the Earth Best instead. The baby didn't like it and it was hard to feed through the bottle<br /><br />The only problem i have is what's up with the 3/4 of the container? Why it is not as full as it's used to be? Keeping static price in expense of the quantity i guess? oh well...economy it is
"I love it! It's strong enough to start at least 10 gallons of wine, yet light enough to be flexible, very important for pushing the lid down inside for a sanitizing solution. Future models should come with calibrations so you know how much liquid is inside but that was easy to overcome with a sharpie and a measuring container."
love this! it has a really good aroma and taste that announces that it contains Truffles. i use it on many foods and am low and need to order more!
"Just a sweet and enjoyable coffee. Almost a dessert coffee, but I drink it all of the time. No stray grounds, another winner from Van Houtte!!"
"My kids and I love root beer and I brew my own from time to time. Recently while purchasing some specialty versions from a local store I saw the Jack Blacks Red Dead Root Beer and thought the label was cool so I grabbed a couple. After we sampled it, all I can say is don't waste your time. It has little to no root beer flavor,it finishes a little spicy in fact. It has caffine added which was a bit of a put off as well. I was very disappointed with the flavor of this product. If you want a pick me up and you don't mind it tasting like sugar water mixed with dish soap then this is the drink for you."
licorice  has  no  flavor very hard  to eat it was in a seal  bag  but  it  hard  not soft like other  licorice
"I was disappointed in this product because I thought it would be bigger.<br />Also, it did not come with enough icing. I had to use my own."
"My husband and I both really enjoy the taste of this coffee.  I tend to like a full robust flavor, and my husband likes his coffee on the milder side, but this coffee satisfies us both.  It is 'just right'!"
"When I returned to work a few months ago a few months ago after the birth of my 2nd child, I initially was able to pump 10-12oz during my lunch hour but after about 4 weeks at work, my supply precipitously declined. I then started to take non-gaia brand fenugreek seed capsules for a week without a significant change in my supply.  I then switched to this brand Gaia and took 3 capsule after breakfast and 3 capsules after lunch along with Gaia lactation support 1 capsule between breakfast & lunch and my supply was instantaneously back up: 10 ounces at lunch again. I've been doing this for about a month now with excellent results. This stuff is amazing!"
Green Mountain has become our new favorite for our Keurig.  My husband loves it mild flavor of Nantucket Blend.  You cannot beat the convenience of getting it online!!!
"While I didn't like this flavor as well as the black cherry, it was still quite good.  Had a nice fruity taste and not overly sweet, probably because there is no added sugar.  You won't miss the sugar and neither will your kids.  This is a good alternative to regular soda for the kids because it doesn't have all the additives that soda does.  It's basically carbonated fruit juice.  It's 100% juice, so you get a nice dose of Vitamin C (100% daily allowance according to the can).  Adults will enjoy it too.  The can is 8.3 oz., which is smaller than a 12-oz soft drink, but it is just enough to satisfy your soda craving, without filling you or your kids up too much.  Sugar is sugar whether naturally occurring in juice or added, so these are not health drinks, but are great alternatives to the much more sugar and additive laden sodas."
"I love a good cup of flavored coffee, but hesitate trying new flavors.  It's not because I don't want to do so, but because if I don't like a coffee I am too frugal to dispose of it.  However, since I love Magnum Coffee Roaster's Chocolate Fudge Brownie Coffee, I decided to give their Vanilla Nut Pumpkin Pie Coffee a try.  I was pleasantly surprised by how well I liked this flavored coffee.  The coffee is a nice medium roast.  It is smooth and leaves no acidic aftertaste.<br /><br />I could not distinguish any vanilla flavor or any nut-like flavor in the coffee.  Nor could I isolate any pumpkin pie taste; rather, the primary flavor was of cinnamon.  Since pumpkin pie has more complex spicing than simply a cinnamon flavor, I was puzzled by the choice of name for this otherwise very good product.<br /><br />This is a very good choice for anyone who likes spiced beverages, and who wants a good cup of flavored coffee.  I think that you might enjoy this on a cold, winter day while sitting in front of a nice fire and reading a good book - perhaps on your Kindle!"
"This is really a great product.  Works and tastes just like the gluten product.  Our son is a celiac and we have tried a lot of products.  We rate this ""crossover"" brand one of the best."
"This drink left me thirsty, which isn't good when said drink is supposed to quench your thirst.  It's bottle is appetizing, though I found the drink took very little time to finish.  When it comes to taste, it was lacking.  Either the mixture of the Kiwi and Berry was off or something because it reminded me far more of an energy drink than a juice drink.  To its benefit, there was no icky after taste.<br /><br />I will not be 'switch'ing anytime soon to this drink, but recommend giving it a try, as all our taste buds are different.  Maybe you'll like it.  It just wasn't my cup of tea."
"Was pleased with the packaging and prompt delivery however EVERY SINGLE PACKAGE WAS EMPTY.  No coffee inside.  No broken seals or holes, just nicely sealed empty k-cups.  Would like coffee with my coffee"
"I guess it's a matter of tastebuds but unless this healed me for good I wouldn't drink another sip if I was paid to drink it. Okay - there might be a price that would make me drink it everyday but only one cup and the price is pretty high :-) I've tried several yogi teas and this one as well as the others are just absolutely horrible.  If I don't like something or I have an allergic reaction (which I frequently have from foods or preservatives) I usually pass it on to my mother or sister so the money isn't wasted but this, I threw away, every last package.  Another good reason for Amazon to sell food in smaller quantities. YUCK!"
"As a therapist I have very little time at work to eat, this is a tasty wonderful option, with a high amount of protein. This by itself will keep me full for at least three hours! LT"
My neighbor and I love this candy and it's difficult to find the 1.7 oz. packets in the stores.  So I just decided to purchase a whole case.  They were fresh and great tasting.
This is by far my favorite morning and go-to k-cup.  Great richness and body.  Not weak at all even though it is described as a medium blend.
You have the best price on the almond paste.  It's twice as much in the grocery stores.  You have to use 4 tubes to make 1 batch of cookies and you can't just eat 1.
"I ordered 3 packs of 27-count greenie dog chews from Entirely Pets and have ordered this product from various sources for many years. I have now opened the 2nd pack and both were the same:  all of the greenies were stuck together in one big lump.  I had to forcibly pull them apart.  Although I didn't try them myself, it leads me to believe these are old products and probably stale.  I will not order from this vendor again, even if it is a buck or so cheaper."
"For starters, I'm not salt or msg averse. I enjoy salty food like chips, jerky, and bacon. However, these pork rinds are ridiculously salty tasting. To give you a better idea of what I'm referring to, Kettle Chips Sea Salt variety have 55 mg of salt per 1/2 oz of chips. Lowrey's pork rinds have 310 mg of sodium per 1/2 oz serving. That's roughly six times the salt content of a food considered relatively salty by most people. I read a review on here saying that they were too salty and decided to order them anyway thinking the reviewer was some salt hating baby. Boy, was I mistaken. I wish I hadn't ordered these."
I sat the toy on the floor and he immediately opened one flap and used it to rotate the toy and get the treats in every chamber. It wasn't much of a puzzle and he finished before I could log in to write this review. Less than 2 minutes. I'm not sure I would buy too many more of these products. In theory the product is a good idea. I gave this two stars instead of one because he did enjoy himself in those two minutes.
The chicken is not organic. It is the MAIN ingredient. This is NOT organic dog food. It is marketing lies to fool you into thinking you are paying more for quality ingredients when you are not getting organic chicken.
"My wire haired dachshund loves these treats and they are good for keeping her weight down.  I have found better pricing at times, but since they are not available in any stores, I have to buy them online at whatever the current pricing is."
"For some reason, the stores around me stopped having these.  I use this type of bag for a few things in my life: camping gear (sleeping bag, hammock/tent) is able to breathe without being all over the place, storage of down comforter during summer, etc.  Then I got the great idea of using them for my recycling.  What a change in life this has been.  For three years, we've had to take moldy cans to the recycle center to redeem all our beer cans for the 5¢ apiece.  The little sips of beer in each can accumulate, and get trapped in a plastic bag, so I took my recycle cans and drilled holes in the bottom for drainage, then I line them with these bad boys.  The beer leaks right out, and when they're full, they're dry and while they smell slightly of stale beer, the change to that from stale wet beer and mold is incredible.<br /><br />Would I trust them for laundry?  Probably not if I had to carry it any distance.  They're mesh bags.  Going up or down stair or across the house is probably not a big deal.  Since I don't have machines, I wait until the last possible minute to do my laundry, so these bags would be totally and utterly full, stretching the mesh past its abilities, and would probably rip on the first or second go.  If you're smarter than me, though, and do your laundry in a reasonable amount of time, or don't have to leave your house/complex to do it, they'd probably be fine."
"I was optimistic about this, but neither the people nor the dogs would eat this cereal.  We threw out all 6 boxes."
"I have ONLY fed my 3 dogs Canidae since 2002. Until 3 days ago we have HAD no problems at all, and I had highly recommended the food to everyone who would listen. That is NO longer the case.<br /><br />Recently, Canidae decided to change the formula, and without any notice being placed on the bag.  Two weeks into the first, and LAST bag of Canidae I will every buy, one of my dogs began chewing his feet. Prior to 3 days ago, he had never had a ""hot spot"" or anything close to it.... And now I cannot get him to stop chewing his red, soaking wet paws. One expensive vet bill later, the vet said it is an ""allergic reaction.""  Allergies??!! I do not want my dogs to be miserable with allergies!!<br /><br />Besides the constant chewing, not one of my dogs has had a firm stool since their first meal with the new formula. One of my dogs is prone to anal glad issues, and so it is critical that she have a firm stool.<br /><br />In addition to my issues, my breeder, who recommended the food to me, and who has been feeding her dogs Canidae for much longer than I, has taken her dogs off the food. Why? Her dogs became violently ill, vomiting non-stop, itching, acting lethargic. She has contacted the MANY, MANY people she knows who use Canidae, and they have all had issues, many have taken their dogs to the vet, and have all now switched to a different food... not made by Canidae.<br /><br />It's too bad they chose to make this change; they have lost countless loyal customers over trying to save money on rice. I can't imagine they will be in business much longer.<br /><br />******** UPDATED 10/2/08 : I've moved all my dogs to California Natural. My breeder has also switched her dogs to California Natural. So far everyone is doing great... after the Canidae got out of their systems."
"After reading all the great reviews, I optimistically ordered some of this tea. I've had problems with sinus congestion very often this winter and have tried all kinds of remedies with little success.  Unfortunately, this really didn't do anything for me.  The taste is OK (bearable), but it did nothing to relieve my sinus congestion.  (So far the only things I've found that have helped me somewhat are the Vicks personal warm mist humidifier and Neti Xlear)"
I use this salt and don't tell people that I'm using it.  It makes me look like I'm a chef!I only use it as a finishing salt though<br /><br />Ron
"A friend gave me a tea bag to try while at work yesterday.  I accidentally oversteeped the tea and expected a very strong bitter brew.  I was very happy with the smoothness of this tea.  While it was quite strong, nothing was overpowering and the bitterness I expected was not present at all.<br /><br />My 2nd brewing was done with more care.  This tea has an exceptionally smooth taste and excellent flavor.  I'll be buying Ahmad tea in the future."
Best bagged pure green tea out there. Great flavor. It's my go to tea. The tea is a great value as well seeing as you can get it for about $0.21 a bag by ordering the 6-box pack.
"As a previous reviewer stated, the wells for the treats in this game were too narrow and deep for my dog's nose/mouth to reach the treat. The very first time she tried it she cut her mouth on the plastic edges and started bleeding.  I didn't think this would happen as she isn't a large dog with a big snout (30 lb. Cocker Spaniel mix) - her snout is longer and thinner than an average Cocker. It would have helped to know the size of the treat compartments to have an idea of the size before I purchased this. I measured it myself and it is about 1.5"" deep, 2 1/8"" wide and 2 1/4"" long. Seems big enough, but it wasn't. Additionally, only 1 of the 3 yellow compartment covers that are meant to flip up to expose the treat actually stay up long enough to allow a few seconds for the dog to get the treat. The other 2 fall down right away on top of the dog's face which could result in more cuts to the eyes or other parts of the face. I was disappointed because my dog was excited to play and find the treats, but I couldn't let it continue with her being cut. Good game concept, but edges of the toy need to be more smooth and rounded. I am returning this tomorrow."
"Vanilla flavor is barely noticeable.  Acidic taste, not at all what I expected.  Breakfast in Bed and Hawaiian Hazelnut are much better choices."
"After trying several brands of Hot Cocoa my kids have decided that this is the one for them.  I'm certainly happy about it because not only is it delicious, but it's also more affordable.  3 boys can consume a box of hot cocoa very quickly, even with limits set.  It's also very convenient to have it shipped automatically.  If we don't drink that much I simply skip a month.  If friends come over and we drink a lot, I just order an extra box.  It's quick, simple and delicious."
"The delivery was extremely quick, the packaging was fine, and if you suck off all the honey, the almonds even taste pretty good. but i for one do not like this flavor. Mind you, I could eat 3095826 honey roasted PEANUTS."
"I was all set to buy these thinking they'd be great for my dog.  Then I found:<br /><br />""At least 13 dogs have died after being fed the top-selling pet treat in the country, owners and veterinarians have told CNN. The problem comes because the treats, called Greenies, become lodged in a dog's esophagus or intestine and then some veterinarians say they don't break down. A CNN investigation uncovered 40 cases since 2003 where a veterinarian had to extract a Greenie from a dog after the treat became lodged either in the animal's esophagus or intestine. In 13 of those cases, the pet died.""<br /><br />The directions also tell customers to monitor dogs to ensure the treat is adequately chewed and to always offer water after feeding. ""Gulping any item can be harmful or even fatal to a dog,"" the directions say.<br /><br />Some vets and pet owners say the directions are unrealistic.  ""These things tend to be wolfed down,"" said Dr. Brendan McKiernan, a board certified internist at the Wheat Ridge Animal Hospital outside Denver. ""They are meant to be chewed carefully, but that's like giving a sharp knife to your 2-year-old. Dogs can't be controlled that way.""  [...]<br /><br />Even though the info from these links may be BEFORE they improved them, and considering the following quote:  ""At the end of the day ... literally millions of Greenies are enjoyed by dogs on a weekly basis with absolutely no incidents,""<br />[...]<br /><br />I'm still extremely leary."
"I bought these on a whim and I have to say, worth it.<br />These are so tasty I have to keep them in stock. My new favorite comfort snack. Goes great with beer."
"Recently purchased a case of Mori-Nu from Amazon ... I'd had this tofu before and the product I got from Amazon is fine. Though, a word of caution - my case only has about 4 1/2 months to go on its ""best by"" date. The date on the box represents one year from manufacture, so this product had been sitting around a while. Not a huge problem but I'll be looking for silken-tofu recipes now (vegan ice cream!), to use this up, rather than just having silken tofu on hand for a while, as I'd hoped."
"To quote another reviewer, I can't understand the high praises these chips have been receiving.<br /><br />Based on their popularity and high review score I ordered the 6-flavor variety pack off of Amazon. With some excitement I tore open the packaging and tried the various flavors. I was met with disappointment. Texture-wise, these chips are not crunchy at all and are unsatisfying. The flavors vary from terrible to passable. I couldn't finish the pack of what they call ""salt and vinegar"" chips.<br /><br />I suppose these chips might be popular with people who are trying to watch their weight.<br /><br />An anecdote: the day after I received these I gave the rest away to the other people in my dorm (who proceeded to affirm my suspicions that these chips were subpar). I then went to the corner shop across the street and bought some salt & vinegar Kettle chips."
We have to hide these boxes and pull them out when our one year-old daughter won't eat anything else.  She will always eat these.  Her brother and sister are always sneaking and eating them too.
I got this product a while back. It was very delicious. I love trying to cook Korean food. I would recommend this product for those who are people new to cooking Korean food. The hot pepper paste came in perfect condition.
I bought this because the price was good and it was convenient to carry to restaurants. I have been using xylitol for several years and like that it has NO aftertaste.  This product has a bad aftertaste.  The little bit of sucralose they added to the xylitol to make the product sweeter takes over and leaves a sickening aftertaste.  If you are used to using Splenda or other sucralose based products you probably will not notice it but I really did.  Will not be buying this product again.
"I originally bought these grape laces two years ago for my cousin who tasted them once and fell in love.  I was never able to find them locally and after much searching, I discovered them on Amazon.  I should have known!  That's where I start looking for everything else.  Anyway, these are delicious, reasonable in price, and they make my cousin very happy.  I would recommend them to anyone who loves licorice, in any flavor."
"Although the description states that the salt-free version of Cavender's contains no msg, BEWARE. I sprinkled a little of this on beef last night while cooking it, and my intestines are still talking back to me 12 hours later! 'Flavor base seasoning' and 'five other spices' are both mystery ingredients in this mixture, that probably contain msg. NOT FOR MSG SENSITIVE PEOPLE!"
This is the best popcorn around.  I use it for my rental business as it is so convienent for the customers to use.  All of my customers absolutely LOVE the popcorn and I've had repeat business because of it.  I would only stick with this brand as it doesn't get better than this!
Amazon pirated my personal image for their listing. It is not a stock image.  I created it and put my website name on it...LooneyStuff.com...for use on my website. I have asked them to take my image down from this listing.
"2 boxes of truffles I had to throw away. They tasted old, stale and had been melted and recooled probably several times by the way they looked."
"I ordered this expecting to receive, ""Lorina Sparkling Lemonade , 11.1-Ounce (Pack of 12)is a six-flavor gourmet selection"", as it states clearly in the description and shows clearly in the photo.  I received a 12-pack of one variety only.  In fact, I ordered two variety packs and received two packs of the same variety.  These people are liars and I expect them to re-ship what they say they are selling."
"My dog tends to get stomach problems if he's fed non-organic food, so I'm careful to always buy him organic (he probably eats better than I do). He snarfed up these treats readily and clearly enjoyed them, with no resulting tummy troubles that we saw."
This is only the second time I have ever tried grade B maple syrup. I liked this one better than Now Foods grade B. I think it has more maple flavor. I only give it 4 stars because of lack of experience compared to others. I think its priced well and it was shipped well.  I really love it on plain yogurt as well as pancakes and waffles. Would definetly buy again.
"My husband and I absolutely love this tea! It tastes great especially with a drop of honey and it is very relaxing. I have asthma and allergies and sinus problems ... and this tea sort of calms my whole respiratory system. So, I highly recommend this tea, I am sick right now, and I drank this tea with 2 tea bags and honey and I did feel better, a little easier time breathing. My husband uses it when he's stressed, and it does relax him and calm him. This tea is great througout the day and wonderful to relax with at night and really awesome if you are sick, to sit with and sip and just try and feel better."
"Over the years I have tried making iced tea out of dozens of different herbal teas and most just end up tasting like lightly-flavored water.  This Yogi Sweet Thai Delight tea is the first I've tried that I will make again.  As a matter of fact, I intend to have a jug of it in the refrigerator all summer!  The taste is amazingly sweet (but not in a sugary way) and a little nutty (actually ""coconut-ty."")  I don't use sweeteners or milk in my tea as a rule, but even if I did I wouldn't want to add sugar to this tea, it's perfectly sweet as it is.<br /><br />Since there's no recipe for iced tea on the box, I just winged it and put 8 tea bags into a gallon of boiling water, then turned it down and let it steep covered for about twenty minutes.  You could probably also make it the way my Mom made tea in the summer, by putting the bags in a gallon jar, adding room temperature water, sealing it and setting it in the sunniest place in the yard for the day.<br /><br />However you make it, you really should try this tea iced.  I'm not a huge tea drinker normally, but I'm completely hooked on this one."
"Yes it is low acid and doesn't cause acid indigestion or heart burn. It had a really full bodied aroma while brewing but fell a bit short on taste - but I'm a black coffee drinker so sharpness & flavour are very noticeable to me. My husband (who does take cream & sweetener in his coffee) said it was a good cup of coffee to his taste.<br />I think it may have been the ""dark french roast"" that to me tasted a bit ""woody"".<br />So I'll give this 4 stars & try again, with a different roast.<br />My final analysis is, if you get heartburn or acid indigestion drinking coffee, this is the answer to your prayers. But I wouldn't recommend the Dark French Roast - unless you take cream with your coffee."
This is my second box of greenies that I have been quite pleased up until today.  I pull out on greenie and found a WORM along with larvae!! This is horrible.  I had this box for 3 months.  I emptied the box and found about a dozen more worms and was disgusted.  I couldn't believe greenies product was contaminating my dogs.  The expiration date is dated 2013 so this clearly shows that there is something wrong with this product.  I hope someone from the greenies department will give contact me to fix this.  I will be posting these comments on every doggy treat review forum/website until I hear from someone so I know that they are trying to fix it and shows how much they value their customers and product.  I don't know how long I have been feeding greenies with worms in them so my two pups will now have to go to the vet.
"I've used Lipton's Loose Tea for almost 50 years now and will never change to another brand unless Lipton's goes out of business.  The loose tea consistently makes absolutely the best glass of iced tea.  Tea bags (any brand) are no comparison, not even close to the same great flavor of Lipton's loose leaf tea. I have a large extended family with many friends, my iced tea is famous among them, for being the best....Thanks Lipton's!  And....thanks Amazon for the wonderful subscription service....Love it!!"
"my dog love it very much, the fist thing that she wake up in the morning is eat the greenies!"
"Because this litter is a wheat product, it attracts meal bugs. My bag actually came with the bugs in it - when I opened the bag, left it in the bathroom, and came back a few hours later, the bugs were crawling out of the bag and up the wall. I have done everything to eliminate the bugs. Naturally I disposed of every crumb of Swheat Scoop. But once you have these in your house, it is very difficult to get rid of them permanently, due to the life cycle of meal bugs. You think you've eliminated them, and then a few months later, they're back. Do not buy this product, even if you think it works great as a cat litter. You run the risk of being plagued by bugs forever."
I ordered these crackers because I've recently become allergic to wheat and have to eat gluten free.  These crackers arrived crumbled.  There were maybe 5 whole crackers in the entire box.
"Having only eaten instant oatmeal, I was looking for a whole grain oatmeal that would offer more health benefits. I came Coach's Oats at Costco and I'm glad I did. Easy and quick to cook. It tastes good enough on it's own, but I usually add a banana, raisins, berries or dried fruit. It also makes a healthy and filling snack - adding a bit to yogurt or sprinkling it on other foods. Sometimes I'll even eat a tablespoon or so dry or with a half teaspoon of jam or jelly. I'm going to use this to make some super healthy snack bars (there are many recipes online) to replace the sugar-laden and expensive granola bars or energy bars I usually buy."
"I HAVE ALWAYS LIKE BUSTELO ESPRESSO REGULAR, AND STILL DO. I FIND VERY LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN TASTE BETWEEN THE BUSTELO PREMIUM AND THE REGULAR TO MERIT THE EXTRA COST."
"The Snack Shop could not fulfill our order and provided two phony excuses that appear in other reviews:  1) that the product could not be tracked because it was shipped via the USPS; and 2) that it was ""undeliverable.""  Both of these excuses are false.  The USPS has tracking services for all product shipments, including the $25 2-day shipping I paid for.  And the USPS has been delivering to our address for three years without fail.  What the Snack Shop doesn't know is that we work from home and there was never even an attempt to deliver this shipment despite their e-mail stating, ""the item has been shipped.""  It also appears that many of these 5/5 reviews are very short, just the type that paid reviewers might file if they were paid by the number of reviews.  Thanks to Amazon's Customer Service for resolving this dispute and getting our money refunded.  They ought to bar this vendor from the Amazon Market as their phony excuses look like a pattern."
"I have enjoyed this tea for the past few months. Having a cup in the morning with a little milk and sugar (or honey). But recently it seems to have vanished from store shelves. I can't find it anywhere except online (thanks Amazon!).<br /><br />I am looking for a replacement, trying Celestial's Chai and Good Earth Chai. Tazo is too strong. Hopefully I can find one that comes close, looks like the Lipton Spiced Chai will soon be a discontinued item (the lipton web site no longer lists it as a product). Sad."
"The web information fails to mention the main ingredient is alcohol, with a small percentage as ""pure"" extract."
"The coffee is good. However, at least half of these haven't been sealed correctly. When I brew them the edge of the foil pops open and coffee grounds go everywhere. Not fun to clean. It may have just been the batch we got, but I won't be ordering these again."
"I try to only consume organic products which led me to this tea. I drink tea daily so I needed it in bulk to save money.  This fits the bill perfectly and tastes great.  I usually use two bags instead of one to get it as strong as I like it, but for this price I don't mind.  Highly recommend."
"The Price is great, The serving is just right for a snack, and ITS A COOKIE. Buy a bunch and they send it to your house!!"
"I was introduced to Runa guayusa about 6 months ago and I have been drinking it pretty consistently since then. It is a great alternative to coffee, which tends to make me nervous. The taste is mild and almost a little sweet, also it doesn't get bitter like green tea or yerba mate when steeped for too long.<br /><br />Also Runa's business model makes me feel good about drinking this tea, they are a certified B Corp and they do great work with the farmers in the Amazon.<br /><br />I highly recommend you try it!"
"These are my favorite of all the popchips I have had so far.  I can't find them in stores, so I order them, and you should too!!"
"Material is very thin and the shirt had several spots where the color was faded.<br />The only thing that it had going for it was the fact that it was cheap, but I guess sometimes you get what you pay for."
We just love this popcorn. It's just like being at the theater -- only better. Doesn't have that fake butter flavor that our theater has.
"Pacific Crest Sardines can be hit and miss. Sometimes I get sardines with extra scales that I literally have to wash off in order to consume.<br /><br />These still taste great and you can rinse out the extra oil with a bit of hot tap water to reduce calories.<br /><br />Regarding the 'smoked' flavor...I honestly taste no discernible difference in flavor from the Pacific Crest Sardines in water...just a bit richer because of being packed in soybean oil instead of water.<br /><br />These sardines have 8 grams of fat per can but if you rinse them off, they probably are closer in fat content to the Pacific Crest sardines in water which only have 3 grams of fat per can."
"I can't say enough good things about Plocky's chips!!  I have purchased this flavor and the black bean flavor <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GWKO7G"">Plocky's Tortilla Chips, Black Beans 'N Rice, 7-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)</a> and I love them!  They taste better than more well known brands and are very satisfying.  I have never eaten a tortilla chip that didn't make me feel guilty afterwards.  Not with Plocky's...I always eat less and feel satisfied.  I actually prefer these eaten by themselves..no dips...and I keep a bag in my desk at work.  I have even had them for lunch when there is no time to grab something.  I bring them to work to share with friends and they love them too.  I am a fan of Plocky's chips and will continue to purchase them on Amazon."
"Shake N Bake is my son's favorite, ever since he was a toddler he has loved it. He's a senior in high school and his birthday dinner *still* must be Shake N Bake. Be it chicken or pork chops, he doesn't care, his only requirement is a coating of Shake N Bake!<br /><br />Whenever we have to feed a large group at once, my favorite way to make Shake N Bake is to coat your meat of choice with whatever flavor of Shake N Bake you have handy (they work equally well with any meat). Melt a stick of butter or margarine or even pour some olive oil into the bottom of your casserole dish, and bake the meat according to package directions (turning about halfway through). Your food will come out with a crispy coating and a juicy, delicious flavor!<br /><br />If you need topping for a casserole or mac n cheese, a sprinkling of Shake N Bake on top will serve in a pinch as well."
"Since I am willing to try alot of new things. I thought that I would buy this product.. And since I do like hot cocoa, I bought 2 boxes.. WORST thing I could have done.. This is bland, with very little flavour. It also has a grainy texture near the bottom of the mug.<br />Personally I will not buy this product again. I will stay with swiss miss or another hot cocoa brand for the Keurig K-Cup"
What a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use.  This box should last our family the year no problem.  Iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will.
"I have been using this mix for about 8 months now. It makes all types of incredibly good breads. I throw in all sorts of things such as nuts, cranberries, raisons, etc for variations. I have added ground almonds or peanuts for a hearty filling bread. I have purchased and tried about 20 other mixes and many were inedible so it was such a treat to find this mix. I set my bread maker for just plain white bread. I do not use the gluten free setting since the white bread setting gives me the best bread."
Bought the tea as part of a present for someone who knows good tea.  Got excellent feedback about taste and price.
I brought a box with me to visit my daughter and family.<br />We all enjoyedjthe fiber gourmet light penne  very much.
"I like creamy peanut butter, however this is hard to spread because part of the oils are kept out to make it reduced fat. Kinda makes for a messy sandwich."
"I don't have a problem getting my 8 glasses of water each day but I sometimes like a little beverage diversity and individually packaged drink packs are a good way to add a bit of a kick to water.  Because these are individual packets, it is easy to keep a few in a gym bag, work desk or purse.  I think the flavor is pretty good with no strange aftertaste.  I purchase my Wyler's lemonade at my local grocery store for about 10 cents a packet.<br /><br />Some individuals may be concerned to know that this product has aspartame and acesulfame potassium. A lot of diet beverages use these additives. Both have been linked to cancer in rats and both were deemed one of the top ten worst additives by the Center for Science in the Public Interest. So, if you are cautious about additives in your food, this product may not be for you.  A serving for this product is 1/2 of a packet and 1/2 of a packet has 5 calories and 20% of your daily vitamin C.  To make a full, sufficiently flavored 16 ounce glass, you really do need the entire packet.<br /><br />If you are seeking an alternative product that does not utilize these controversial ingredients and has more vitamins, I would recommend Acai Lemonade by NOW Foods. It is somewhat pricey but can be found more economically off of Amazon. That product has 15 calories and is loaded with vitamins. It has 100% of you daily vitamin C, 25% of Vitamin A, 50% of Vitamin D, 50% of Vitamin E, 50% of Thiamin, 50% of Riboflavin, 25% of Niacin, 50% of B-6, 50% of Folate, 50% of Pantothenic Acid and 1670% of Vitamin B-12.<br /><br />Wyler's Light Pink Lemonade is really flavorful, easy to pack and can be very economical.  Those who want to avoid sugar substitutes may want to use this product in moderation or steer clear.<br /><br />This product is made in the United States."
"Really?  Who blends this stuff and decides that it is good?  Ugh.  I can sum this nastyness up in one quick phrase.  Stale airline coffee!  If you like that flavor, then you will love this one, if you don't like thin cardboard soaked, never washed the pot out, and the water came from a tin canteen, flavored coffee, then you won't like this one either!  I would give this zero stars if I could.  WOW, likely the worst cup of coffee that I have ever had.  I hope Wolfy reads this as his name is on the package and I expected more, now I know not to buy any of his signature products, awesome, thanks for saving me $$ next time!  The package says Extra Bold, but it doesn't taste extra bold.  It's almost like they put some ground instant powder in the mix to make it stronger."
"We have made friends recently with an abandoned tabby cat we call Mr. Whiskers. I am sure he would be grateful for most anything on a plate at this stage, still he appears to be a gentleman of discernment. And at first whiff of Petite Cuisine, he settled down to some serious feeding and joyously licked his whiskers afterwards.<br /><br />This is an obviously high end cat food and looks and smells good enough for humans. (Let us hope in this economy it does not come to that.) As long as I can afford it I will continue feeding him this brand. I have seen pets fed cheap food develop terrible tumors on their poor little bodies, so I am committed to serving him the best I can find / afford.<br /><br />Bottom line: if you care about your pet and can afford it I highly reccommend this brand. I was quite impressed by the quality."
"These are the normal sized packets that we all know and love.  Good ol' Regular flavor so it doesn't have all that extra sugar and stuff.  I use 2 packets and about 3/4 cup water.  Just boil the water first in the microwave, then dump it into the bowl which has the oatmeal and sugar and butter.. stir... let it sit for a minute...  makes Breakfast in just a few minutes.  This box has 48 packets so you will have enough to last you a long time!<br /><br />For me, oatmeal does't get better than this (Quaker brand / Regular flavor).  So go for it, you won't be disappointed."
"My dog loves tug-a-war with ropes and etc so I thought this would be a great toy for her, since she is left alone during the day while I'm at work.  The problem is that she tugs on the rope, then smells the treats inside, then won't mess with the rope at all and instead spends her time sniffing at the ""scent holes"" and from the neck of the bottle.  She will try to stick her tongue into the neck of the bottle.  I've demonstrated to her over and over that pulling on the rope dispenses a treat, but she just refuses to pull on the rope, even when I hold onto the bottle end and try to get her to play tug-a-war.  She smells the treat and doesn't want to play, she wants the treat, and she doesn't understand it.  I even took AKC liver treats and cut them into 1/4 and liberally filled the bottom of the jar with them, so that even a mild tug on the rope would result in a piece of treat being released.  She just has no interest in pulling on the rope at all.  She will mess with it for a few minutes and when she can't get the treats out, she leaves it alone.  I was pretty disappointed with it.  I think it would help if they made the outside knot smaller so you could pass the rope through the back of the bottle.  That way you I could get my dog to just play with the rope without worrying about the treats and try putting it back in the bottle once she got used to it.  As is, I've had it a month and she doesn't get, so I'm considering cutting the knot off the end so she can at least play with the bottle and dump the treats out, and play with whats left of the rope seperately."
"This is, by far, my favorite high-antioxidant decaf tea. The flavor is subtle but perfect. You can steep forever and the tea does not become bitter. It's delicious. Since getting this tea, I have not even considered trying another flavor of decaf."
"This gluten-free bar is much better than most - a rich combination of just what it says - fruit and nuts.  However, the unit description is incorrect.  It is not 8 boxes but one box of eight bars."
"This mat is just fine... by me. My cat, on the other hand, avoids it like the plague. It must feel funny to her little toes. I don't think she has stepped on it a single time. Her entire room will be littered with litter (sorry, couldn't resist), but this mat will remain perfectly clean, because she avoids it so religiously. I find myself wondering why I keep using it. I really should just throw it out.<br /><br />I'm sure there are cats out there who might not mind. But, for my cat, this was a no go."
"The product information doesn't tell you that the tea includes processed sweetener (stevia), butterscotch flavoring, and some other processed ingredients.<br /><br />This is not the original recipe for Yogi Tea, though it implies that it is. Even on the Yogi Tea website, it doesn't mention the added artificial ingredients (I know that stevia is from a plant, but it's hightly processed for use as a sweetener).<br /><br />I love the old original yogi tea, but I would never buy this."
"This consistently excellent product has been a boon to our dog's health, from shiny hair to well-formed poop. Being a smaller pet food manufacturer that makes it's own food, it's been hard to find FirstMate in the states, so THANK GOODNESS FOR AMAZON and it's SUPER SAVER shipping option!"
"Though i'm not a huge fan of oatmeal, this product delivers on great taste and convenience. All i have to do is grab a pack and get a cup of hot water from Starbucks for my morning breakfast. It's simple, filling and a great combination for me.I say go get this product for taste and convenience."
"All of the positive reviews led me to believe this popcorn was going to be really great. Truth is, I am disappointed. The popcorn kernels are tough, chewy and lack any great corn taste. I want popcorn that snaps when you bite into it.  I will go back to buying the premium Orville Redenbacher's brand at my local grocery."
Wanted to let those in the States know that yesterday I found these at Cost Plus World Market. They have a new shipment of old/new candies. Old as in olden days that are re made for us generation x and y'rs.<br /><br />I am now officially hooked on pocket coffee!
"Pure Ghee is a staple in our home. Although it may seem to be a luxury to spend on a condiment it will become one of those ingredients one cannot live without. I have tried many 'health food' store commercial brands and I have tried to make my own, but they pale in comparison. My 14yo son loves to cook eggs in ghee and is quite disappointed when we are running low and usually adds ghee to our Amazon cart. It is essential for those who follow a GAPS diet, Wise Tradition, or other 'healthy fat' lifestyle. If not, no matter. Pure Ghee tastes great on toast, popcorn and ANY Indian/Indonesian recipe and great for traveling/camping/pack-backing because it doesn't require refrigeration. Some spend on expensive coffee, great wines or cheeses, or other gourmet products, but if we had to choose Pure Ghee always comes first in our home."
These are absolutely the best peanuts ever! This was not my first time buying them. It most definetly won't be the last. They are huge and lightly salted. Very very flavorful.
"This coffee has a nice bold flavor without being bitter.  It actually does remind me of a Dunkin' Donut cup of coffee.  Plus it's decaf which I like because I can drink it anytime.  If you like a Dunkin' Donut type of coffee and you're looking for a good decaf, this is the one."
"These are the plumpest, softest dried cranberries I have ever had. They taste great, are sweetened with only apple juice and are organic to boot! I love everything I have ever tried from the Eden Foods company. They make a great addition to salads, oatmeal, cereal, etc. etc."
"We use this in our large popper and it makes just the right amount for 2 people for movie night. It really does have a movie theatre like taste too. Simple to use, not to many kernels left unpopped."
"Being the lone Celiac in the crowd makes for challenging entertaining. Most of the crackers I've had/served leave a fine dust coating on the pallet, or they have an aftertaste. This cracker does NEITHER. It's a little strong on the sesame flavor, but it really is a great cracker to serve with Alouette cheese, etc.  It was a real crowd pleaser at our holiday gatherings, and several non-Celiac family members and friends now keep it on hand in their pantries just because of the taste. One of the things that I just couldn't keep plated was when I put a little garlic/onion cream cheese on one of these crackers and topped it with a tidbit of smoked salmon. ;-) The only bad thing (and the first reason I won't give it 5 stars) is that the cracker gets soggy if you plate the stuff even just 30 minutes before serving, so you really have to make it as needed, or let it be self-serve/assemble. The other reason I only give it 4 stars I'm listing as a cautionary statement...<br /><br />CAUTION: it's not certified gluten free, and to my knowledge, it's not tested. There are no gluten ingredients, and I have not reacted, but if you are one who has an instant and severe reaction, contact the manufacturer first to verify whether their production methods, etc., are safe for you."
"These are large biscuits that can be broken in half easily, but are still large.  I gave a half to my 48 pound mutt and she spit it out at first not sure what to do with it.  She's used to the small peanut butter treats from Costco.  I encouraged her to eat it and she finally did.  She left quite a few crumbs along the way which eventually were eaten.  Obviously my dog liked the way the biscuits tasted but I like the neatness of smaller dog treats.  If you have a small dog, these wouldn't work unless you wanted to spend time breaking them into smaller chunks.  If you have a large dog and are looking for an organic alternative, try these."
"I got sent the wrong item, which happens i know.  I tried to contact the company multiple times with no response.  I finally had to contact amazon and they are returning the item for me..."
I haven't tried a bad seasoning flavor yet.  These are wonderful.  My favorites are Vegetable Magic (not just for vegetables....makes delicious omelettes) and Pork Magic (saute centercut pork chops in olive oil and sprinkle with the Pork Magic).  My kids LOVE it.
"This smooth black Earl Grey is a classic. Just the right amount of Bergamot oil. The brew isn't bitter, even if you over steep. Smooth and rich, but not heavy. I often reach for this tea on chilly mornings.<br /><br />Is this review helpful? Let me know, please vote. :-)"
"It's absolutely delicious.  This is the best cheesecake I have ever eaten.  I highly recommend it.  So, what are you waiting for?  Order it!<br /><br />You can thaw out the slices the way I did if you like.  At 30% power, heat 4 slices in a regular microwave for about 55 seconds.  Don't cover them while you are doing this.  Plus, there are slips of paper between each slice, so you need not cut anything or worry about adhesions."
"I ordered this coffee and another brand, it seems, about three weeks ago.  I checked this morning, February 8,  and found the deliver is out into March or Apri.  I  paid for the product soon after it was ordered and have been told on checking delivery that it can no longer be canceled.  Wow!!!!!"
"I was pleased to discover that Switch Orange Tangerine is actually quite tasty.  More please to find out that it contains no sugar, corn syrup or artificial flavors.  What it does have is several healthy ingredients.  I highly recommend it."
"My cat is addicted to Fancy Feast Elegant Medleys.  It doesn't matter if I buy him expensive or cheap alternatives; he won't touch it unless it has those garden greens!  When I saw the new offerings from Petite Cuisine, I decided to give it a try with him.  After all, they have some veggie content, which I figured might appease his tastes.<br /><br />There are a few things I look for in a wet cat food.  First, I want it to have real ingredients listed.  I don't like for it to have by-products.  (FF:EM does, but he's addicted, so I suppress my concern by giving him great-for-him dry food)  Second, I don't want it to stink.  If it turns my stomach when I open a can, I don't care how much he likes it, I'm not serving it.  Third, it needs to come out of the can easily.<br /><br />Petite Cuisine met or exceeded all of my basic criteria.  Next was the big question:  would my addict take to this new brand?<br /><br />With FF:EM, my cat usually begs for it, sniffs it, and then wanders off.  He returns at his leisure at some point and chows down the whole mass in one sitting.  Occasionally, he will wolf it down immediately. So, consider that the baseline behavior.  He has self-feeding access to dry food, and he gets a 3-oz can of wet food at most twice a day (sometimes he doesn't seem to want the second can).<br /><br />I fed him his first Petite Cuisine can from this box, in Chicken Pot Pie flavor, as his second feeding for the day.  I was surprised that this flavor really seemed like a soup and had real (I'm assuming) pieces of carrot and corn.  It really looks like people food.  He seemed to really enjoy the ""soupy"" broth.  This was his second daily feeding and yet he gulped it down for awhile before wandering off.  He came back later in the evening and finished off the rest.  Success!<br /><br />The next day, I started him with a can of the Sesame Chicken.  It smelled pleasantly like Asian food.  His reaction was to sniff and wander off.  After 12 hours, he hadn't touched it but had eaten a large helping of dry food.  So, he was clearly hungry, but didn't want to touch this flavor.  I washed the remains away and gave him a can of FF:EM.  It was gone within a minute.<br /><br />So, I wondered if he'd just been particularly hungry on the Pot Pie day.  A few mornings later, I did Pot Pie for the morning feeding, and I observed the same behavior.  He drank the broth right away and came back later to finish off the bits.  I also re-tested the Sesame Chicken on a day when I knew he was hungry, and he ignored it steadily.  Clearly, my kitty has preferences.  I have tried some other Petite Cuisine flavors (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BDDTB2"">Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, Tuna & Shrimp) for Cats, 3-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a>) that are available on Amazon.  He will chow down on Tuna & Shrimp flavor but generally doesn't seem to like the other seafood PC flavors (though he will eat them if left with them, unlike the Sesame Chicken reaction).<br /><br />My point is that my cat is picky, and he will eat at least some flavors of this happily even though he's rejected MANY high-quality foods in the past.  It is nice to have an alternative to the one brand.  I'm also happier with him eating this food given the good ingredients and pleasant appearance and scent.<br /><br />I do want to add/note that there are many folks who are mentioning that the food is more liquid than substance.  That is definitely true for the Pot Pie flavor, but it is not true for Petite Cuisine in general.  The Pot Pie is definitely made to resemble soup."
"I tried this Root beer for the first time about a week ago. I had been drinking Zevia Root Beer (which is really good, too), but decided to start buying this brand, instead. I love the taste of both, but this one has a creamy taste to it which I prefer. I was so glad to find sugar-free sodas that didn't have all those nasty artificial sweeteners in them!! I highly recommend Blue Sky Free (and Zevia, as well). Oh, and the Blue Sky Free Cherry Vanilla Creme is awesome!! The only ones I don't personally recommend are the colas in either Zevia or Blue Sky free brand.. they are bleh, but that's just me."
"I tried this product solely for the fact it has Wolfgang's name on it.  I should have stuck with Timothy's brand.  This was way too strong to be labeled a breakfast coffee, more like a dinner coffee.  I will not be buying this again, also way too expensive compared to the others."
"I tried the Puroast low acid French Roast coffee and I really liked the taste and the smoothness of the coffee.  The fact it was low acid enabled me to have a second cup of coffee without experiencing any of the discomfort in my stomach I would have with my regular coffee, which is Starbucks House Blend.<br /><br />This is really good news for me since I love coffee.  But, as someone who suffers from stomach ulcers, one cup of coffee was my limit.  I also did a side-by-side taste comparison with my usual Starbucks and the Puroast low acid coffee came out on top.<br /><br />I finally found a coffee that satisfies my taste buds without aggravating my ulcers.  Here's to a second cup of coffee without the pain."
"If you're looking for bargain basement chocolates this isn't for you.  But if you want to try a taste you'll never forget and probably buy more, as I did, you can't go wrong.  This is simply the best I've ever had, bar none.  It's expensive, so's an Acura, but both are worth it."
"I used two of the 5 gram pouches for a gallon of milk (one sleeve for a total of 10 grams).  I do not have a yogurt maker and used a stainless steel pot on the stove.  After the heating process, I put the cultured milk in my oven to incubate over about 8 hours (longer than suggested).  Periodically, I'd turn the oven on for a minute or so to get the mixture about 100 degrees F, but I bet the temperature fluxuated quite a bit.<br /><br />I then strained the yogurt through cheesecloth for a few hours (while sitting at room temperature).  The yogurt is far tastier and smoother than Fage brand Greek-style yogurt.  It's about the consistency of very thick mayonaise or sour cream.  I doubt I will ever eat mayo or sour cream again.<br /><br />The starter is very forgiving.  Now that I have cultured yogurt, I'll probably use the mother instead of the starter.<br /><br />If you are interested in instructions or a recipe, although I did not follow this book exactly, it's a great reference:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1931498237"">Wild Fermentation: The Flavor, Nutrition, and Craft of Live-Culture Foods</a>"
"I received this box with great anticipation since they don't sell these on the west coast. I got the package, opened the box and was EXTREMELY disappointed. The cookies looked like a gorilla shook the box to death and left most of the box filled with crumbs. AND THERE WAS A RODENT SIZED HOLE ON THE SIDE OF THE BOX!!!!!!!! So, needless to say I will not NOT be reordering these again."
"Wow, at first I was thinking ""caffeine free""?  Eh.  But, sniff the satchel packet and you'll be instantly invigorated with the sinus clearing powerful mint!  It's really minty, what you'd expect it to taste like.  Doesn't need sugar, it's sweet enough by itself.  I don't really taste the lemon in it."
Gluten free bread mixes have come a LONG way in the last several years. Pamela's known for good products and this is no exception! It's my new fave bread mix.
"These crackers taste absolutely delicious, but leave a coating/aftertaste in my mouth that lasts for a long time.  Also, they contain MSG and for some people (I'm one of them) it causes a headache.  The last time I binged on these crackers (and they are hard to put down!), I ended up with a crashing headache.  Be forewarned!"
"I love peppermint, but find hard candy just too strong.  These melt in your mouth and aren't overwhelming and don't leave an aftertaste."
"There were several different flavors of truffles in the box and they were all great. If you like chocolate truffles, you are going to love this box of candy."
"I'm not sure how you review something that's as subjective as taste, but suffice to say that if you like chocolate and graham cracker, you'll like this (it doesn't taste exactly like either of those, but that's the closest analogy for me).  The sticks themselves are a cracker of some kind, dipped in chocolate, with one end left just normal cracker to you don't get your fingers covered in chocolate while eating.<br /><br />Here's some of the nitty gritty details - each of the boxes contain two individually sealed packets, that contain probably 20 or so of the sticks.  The packets themselves are really cleverly designed, with a little slit cut in the folded part, you just grab both sides and pull, and it opens up the package without any hassle - gotta love Japanese product design!  :)  Another nice design touch is that when you open it properly the grabbing-side of the stick is right at the top.<br /><br />Each of the packets has 210 calories (90 from fat), and about 80mg of sodium - so in terms of snacks this is a pretty good option.  It does contain milk, wheat, soybeans and sheanut - so if any of these are an issue for you, then you'll want to pass.  It also says on the packaging that the facility they're manufactured in also processes eggs and peanuts - the product doesn't use either of them, but the disclosure is nice if you're particularly sensitive to either.<br /><br />Overall a great snack at a great price - the 10 pack really is 20 of the packets, so that's quite a few snacks.  One note, if you live in a hot climate, don't order them in the summer because they will melt together (in shipping)!  Duh!  :)"
"this is a yummy, kind of tart dressing - great on salads."
"I used Meyenberg Powdered Goat Milk with my first litter of pups five years ago, and was very pleased with it, so made sure to stock up before my second litter was born.  I supplement the mother's food with it, and mix it with ground puppy food to make a puppy gruel to transition the pups to puppy food.  The pups and their mother seem to love it, and have suffered no digestive problems at all.  It dissolves quickly in warm water and is convenient and easy to store.  I recommend it as a nutritional supplement for nursing mothers and pups both."
Great! I have a dog who is very allergic to lots of stuff and this is safe for him because of no grain corn wheat etc....  the dogs love the taste  I use them for training<br />...
"I (and my little guy) have loved almost all other happy baby products, but this was revolting.  On the up side, my dog loves it . . ."
"First off, I didn't purchase this product through Amazon, but at a local grocery store, so my review only reflects the product itself, not Amazon in any way.  I bought this last week never having tried coconut water before, but I heard good things.  The taste of it was almost like the smell of lawn clippings that had been damp and out in the sun for a long time.  Tasted off and had a faint mold smell to it.  I didn't know if it was supposed to taste like that or not as I never tried it before, but paying as much as I did I felt obligated to finish it off.  I've been ill for about a week after drinking it.  I don't know if it was just a coincidence or the cause of it.  I did email customer service at O.N.E. the day I drank it asking if it was supposed to taste like that or if I got a bad batch, and they still haven't replied to me."
"It seems the flavor selection on Amazon has been limited these days to some variation of hazelnut, french vanilla or chocolate so when I saw this one, I thought I'd give it a try.  Never having had Wolfgang Puck's k-cups, I was hoping they'd be as good as the Wolfgang Puck coffee I've had in hotel coffeemakers that were a part of my room but alas, I was mistaken. I wouldn't say it's the worst I've had but the flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too.  I feel like I'm drinking coffee that's been made with grounds that have already been perked.  In other words - the flavor seems to be already squeezed out of them and I'm getting leftovers.<br /><br />If you're looking for a weakly flavored coffee that doesn't really taste like much of anything, this is your pod.  If you're looking for better, richer flavors, stick with Green Mountain which sadly Amazon doesn't seem to carry anymore except through third party vendors who want to charge $60 for a box!"
"I expected to recieve a box of Greenies, which is why I ordered this.  I thought that it would be a nice and neat way to store them.  Instead what I recieved was a bubble bag full of individually wrapped greenies.  Not neat and easily stored at all.  The picture of this item shows a box, but I did not recieve a box of greenies.  I wish I would have just ordered the bag of greenies, with the ziploc top, at least that is easily stored.  My dog also has a sensitive stomach and food allergies, even though greenies don't have corn in them he still pukes them up and doesn't seem interested in them when I try to give him one.  My larger dog has the bigger size and he likes them just fine, so I guess it just depends on your dog.  My main complain about this purchase was that I didn't recieve the box of greenies that is described.  Maybe they ran out and just threw 45 individually wrapped greenies in a bubble mailer, either way, that was disappointing."
I'm a little shocked that this so-called health food product is made from Chinese grown ingredients.  I'd be curious to see what the carbon footprint of each bite is.  Also keep in mind that Chinese ingredients and products have been found to have all kinds of contaminants such as lead in toys and melamine in milk and other exported food products. All the ingredients in this snack are widely available in the United States.  Why not support products and companies who source locally and consider our own economy before we sell out for a slightly cheaper price?  Your purchasing choice does make a difference.  Let's stop expecting corporations and governments to take care of our safety and economy.  They never will.  We can change the way these companies do business for the benefit of our long term health and economical well-being. Make purchase decisions wisely.
"I ordered one case on a lightning deal since it was significantly less per can than any grocery store in our area. My shipment arrived in perfect condition. It was packed well, and no cans were dented at all. The contents in the cans are the color and taste I would expect for pureed, commercially canned pumpkin (not gray or tart as some reviewers mentioned).  The pumpkin worked well in a vegan pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving, in pumpkin spice muffins for breakfast and in a cream cheese pumpkin dip to accompany ginger snaps on New Year's Eve.  I ordered a second case on a Manager's Special and that one arrived in excellent condition as well.  I was also pleased with the long shelf life.  I would give this product five stars if it was packed in BPA-free cans."
"I too purchased this product thinking it might not be a flavored product, and before it arrived I looked it up to see that there was some rumor as to a coconut flavor.<br /><br />So, lets get this out of the way. *********Do Not Purchase this is you do not like flavored coffee. It is flavored.<br /><br />The first thing you notice is a deep coconut aroma, almost akin to Hazelnut in its presentation. The initial mouthfeel is good, a light roast but a snappiness to the roast which settles in nicely with the flavor, which<br />has a definite dark chocolate taste without the bitterness.<br /><br />The finish is semisweet chocolate, Jamaican coffee and faint toasted coconut.<br /><br />Bottom Line: if you like flavored coffee with coconut/hazelnut/cocoa profiles, you will like this coffee."
"Switch definitely managed to keep its carbonated juice drink's intended flavor fresh. Though just a combination of sparkling water, the juice concentrates of several fruits (including apples, grapes and oranges) and, oddly enough, soy, it definitely maintains its taste of tangerine.<br /><br />I'd love to see what other flavors Switch has to offer, with my only hesitation coming from ""natural flavors and colors."" But, hey, I'm willing to grant them a little leeway in that department thanks to the NO HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP!"
"I've been trying loads of snacks over the last year or more trying to find things my kids like in their school lunches and that are portable.  (older kids...)  Irritating that I have to read reviews (which I didn't do..) to find out these are not as advertised and my kids just can't throw them into their backpacks for a protein snack which is why I got them!  Now I have to buy lunch bags. :(  We also like regular jerky better, these tasted overly fatty with a sour after-taste.  Not impressed and won't ever repurchase.  Amazon needs to not list unless they are listing exactly what they are selling.  3 stars off for misleading...<br /><br />Edit:  I'd never looked up the fat content on these things and thought they were lower fat like many jerkys.  No.  About 9 grams of fat for one stick.  I'll stick with jerky and ""individually wrapped"" jerky at that...<br /><br />Edit again:  As soon as you open this you have very little time before the entire bag turns moldy.  Be sure and refridgerate!  I'd only had these 2 big bags a short time before they were bad.  Never again."
My husband just read on the box that Raisin Bran is now made in Mexico. I was shocked.  I don't feel confident that the quality is the same as if it was made in the USA.  We cancelled our subscription.
"This pumpkin product arrived in good condition and is all that was available after the almost year-long shortage due to Libby pumpkin running out during the 2009 holiday season. My dogs get pumpkin with each meal to help with their digestive system working properly and it works great. Thanks to Farmer's Brand for having enough product to fill our needs. It is more expensive to order online, naturally, but between my 'stop gap' measures of baking squash to serve to my dogs, and alternating between meals with Farmers Brand pumpkin, we will be able to make it through to the next harvest season, where I feel we should purchase our own warehouse full of pumpkin in case the shortage hits us again next year. Thank you Farmers brand and Amazon for helping us through your being prepared to offer your products to us on line. My dogs thank you too... woof!;- )"
"We have three cats, and they all love Petite Cuisane - every flavor. Every time we empty a can into their feeding tray, the cats fight like mad to get their chops on the tasty meal.<br /><br />My wife and I joke...we call it Professional Cat Wrestling. I highly recommend this product for cat owners."
"No problem except we want a bigger box [200?, 400? bags] since we now roll right thru this tea, pot after pot and need to keep the cost down"
"I LOVE chocolate and adore raspberries (Godiva Dark Chocolate Raspberry Truffles were my idea of heaven).  This coffee has been a major disappointment.  I drink a lot of flavored coffees and decided to try this one due to the rave reviews and being a combo of two of my favorite flavors.<br /><br />I've gone through one box, and am either giving the second one away (if I can find someone to take it) or just pitching it.  The quality control on the flavorings is HORRIBLE.  One kcup will be actually almost pleasant (though the raspberry overtones *always* have a ""tinny"" aftertaste), and the next will be so strong in both scent and flavor that it is unbearable and gets dumped.<br /><br />If the flavor/strength of the chocolate and raspberry were consistent throughout, it would be two and a half stars.  As it stands, it's more of a waste of water and electricity."
I always feel refreshed when I drink this coconut water. The pineapple gives it an added extra that makes it truly irresistible. It has been a firm favorite of mine now for nearly a year.
"We have a Keurig coffee maker. One of the side benefits is the opportunity to experiment with different K-cups. I have already tried half a score. Some seem pretty tasty at first--until one taste something that is even better. Some early K-cups that I graded highly don't compare too well with later brands that I have tried.<br /><br />Wolfgang Puck's Columbian Dark Roast Noir is one of the better products that I have tried. It has a bold taste, although not strongly so. It is also smooth tasting.<br /><br />It is now on my short list of possibilities for my first morning cup of coffee. So, I am pretty happy with Wolfgang Puck's product here."
"These sugar pearls are used for makign Belgian ""steet waffles"" common in the 18th century, (and now resurrected by foodies).  The waffles are properly called ""Gaufre Liege"" and are made using this type of beet-based sugar pearls which melt and carmelize using a dough recipe.<br /><br />The more common gooey batter Belgian Waffle recipe is called the ""Bruxelles"" type, and it would be very odd to use these sugar pearls when preparing them.  Ordinary Belgian ""Bruxelles"" waffle batter can be made perfectly using common cane sugar."
"My family loves the taste of these.  They're a bit high in sodium for my liking and for the price, I wish they were organic.  I have purchased the Heart to Heart brand, but they taste much staler and have a strange aftertaste compared to these crackers.  Too bad, because Heart to Heart has half the sodium."
"I find the trays are good but the smaller seeds plug up the holes and slow down drainage. This defeats the purpose so I got the hemp/flax bags and start the smaller seeds in those and then after they sprout I transfer to the trays so they receive more light. They I can also drain quickly by tipping on side and holding the sprouts in. I also keep the trays in the fridge after they mature. They stack and breathe so they are very effective. I plan on buying the larger trays as well for greater farming capacity. Also more hemp bags. I also plan on trying the nut milk bags for sprouting. My only complaint on the hemp ones is they smell a little musty, like wet rope. I am going to try a little H2O2 on them to see if that lowers the smell. To their defense, the smell rinses right off and they work like a champ! I am going to get another batch of three as well. The bags work excellent for bean sprouts all the way to maturity.<br />If anyone has doubts about the power of sprouts, give them a try, they are the apple of my eye!<br />I am now a sprout convert and a farmer in my own house.<br /><br />Cheers to living foods!"
"My doctor recommended the normal 5-hour energy several years ago when I was having mid day slumps and required naps. It worked great while I needed it. Now I have switched to this. I add it to a smoothies about half an hour before I hit the gym and my workouts are great, I have tremendous stamina and do interval treadmill training with no problem, even if it's been a long day.<br /><br />The great thing about it is that you don't really know it's working. After I finish at the gym I realize how much energy i had, but when I am actually doing the routines I don't really notice the energy, it simply happens.<br /><br />I recommend this for anyone, particularly if you don't like, want and can't ingest caffeine.<br /><br />One caution, it has a citrus flavor that, even in a smoothie with mixed berry yogurt, cranberry juice, banana and mixed frozen berries comes through. It's a good taste, unless you don't like citrus."
"Years ago, on one of the shopping networks on TV (quality, value and convenience), the company was doing bus tours where they 'discovered'  entrepreneurs with new and innovative products to sell and they helped them to establish themselves and their products in the marketplace.  A great service I wish this company would do again...<br />Anyway, there was one lady entrepreneur, whose product happened to be a healthy breakfast cookie such as this....<br />I think perhaps it could have been Erin Baker, I could not verify this.<br />I know at the time, I purchased several quantities of this lady's cookies (do not remember the variety) and was VERY pleased with them :)<br />Then, the product was no longer available :(  I was able to get them for awhile at retail store about 25 miles from me and they were costlier than on TV, so stopped purchasing them.<br />Time went by, and my husband requested an item like this to pack in his lunch box for work as well as my teenage son requesting the same for before school in the mornings.<br />After Googling breakfast cookie with thought of making them myself from a recipe, I found Erin Baker on AMAZON and it was like finding an old friend :)<br />Still have not made at home my own cookies, but I will when time allows.<br />For the time being, as long as I can get them on AMAZON for a decent $price$, I will continue to do so. It is nice to have several varieties, when available.<br />Though, I see some of the reviews do not rave about this item as much as I have here, personally, for what they are, I do not hesitate to recommend them and our family enjoys them in moderation."
I am sad to say that my dogs are completely addicted to Greenies. They get one every night after our walk and they never let us forget. Once we get inside they go right to their crates and sit and wait until their treats are given. Good treat for small dogs and a great price on amazon.
"in truth, this is the only kind i have ever purchased, so i can't make a fair comparison.<br /><br />what i CAN say, however, is that even if you go to the manufacturer's website, this deal they have on amazon is a better deal pricewise PLUS it comes in the cans instead of the bags.  PLUS each can comes with a scoop, so there is no need to measure anymore.<br /><br />and lastly, there is the inclusion of the HOT CHAI LATTE Famous Barista Recipe.  now in all truth, i have always said i was making myself a chai latte, when i wasn't.  the barista recipe is the latte in that it adds the milk, which i never did.<br /><br />so that's my take on this.  i hope it helps you in your decision making."
"These look like noodles, but after that there is no comparing this product to pasta.  The texture is rubbery and there is no flavor.  If you love pasta, you will not love this product."
"Have tried most of the flavors and can't say anything bad about any I've tasted. The Teriyaki and Hickory Smoked are my personal favorites. For 99 calories you get 11 Gms. of protein and great taste. Add an apple and/or salad and you've got a full, small meal. Price is good, too."
"I purchased this  after watching a vegetarian recipe on YouTube. I added it to my Chilean Sea bass. Big mistake! This almost ruined my buttery, expensive fish. Perhaps it works well on meat."
"Yeah it's gluten free and whatever, but unless that's a really big issue for you and you're having trouble finding sugary drinks to enjoy on your gluten-free diet, there's no real draw to this drink over say, orange fanta or any number of other carbonated juice type drinks. I thought it was massively overly sweet, and I have something of a sweet tooth. The orange flavor wasn't particularly authentic or delicious, and it left a sour aftertaste. I got a free sample this time, and I cannot see actually paying money to buy this product again. On an environmental note, packaging and shipping these things in tiny little cans makes for more waste, and I don't appreciate that either. Not a fan."
"For about three months we were feeding this formula and the Senior formula to our 18-year-old Gilligan, mainly because he has a very long list of health issues that we try to sidestep like landmines and I strongly believe the prescription foods sold at the vet office are nothing but crap.  I have researched and studied dog foods for several years now and although I believe Canidae is one of better foods out there, Gilligan began having seizures just weeks after he begun eating it and we now home cook his meals.  Gilligan has not had seizures in his lifetime, so we were baffled when all of a sudden he developed a pattern of having a seizure about 3-4 hours after his meal.  His vet said that the pattern made sense to her, because ammonium levels are highest in the blood about 3-4 hours after eating and if the liver doesn't process the protein efficiently, it can definitely cause seizures in the brain.  The day I stopped feeding him the canned food was the last day he had a seizure, and that was about two months ago.  His vet nor I cannot figure out the connection, but my only guess is that it might have something to do with the quality of the meat they use (better than most other brands but still not what humans might consider consumable.)  I must also mention that during this timeframe, Gilligan developed a sinus infection that ultimately we had to have cultured to figure out what it was, and it turns out it was e-coli and the staphococcus bacteria that was up his nose.  Gilligan doesn't have any eyes so when he eats he gets food all over the place (including up his nose), and he was on antibiotics to clear up the infection.  The antibiotics didn't have any effect at all until we stopped feeding him the food (he was on them for about four weeks while eating the food, and about six weeks on his homemade diet.)  Amazingly, the sinus infection began clearing up exponentially after we stopped the canned diet.  He hasn't had any seizures or sinus issues with his home cooked meals, so we won't be going back to Canidae food in the future.  However, for a dog that doesn't have the amount of health issues that Gil has, I still believe the listed ingredients are acceptable and nutritious.  I am extremely critical and picky about the ingredients that go into our dogs' food and I don't find anything on the Lamb or the Senior formulas that severely throws up a red flag except for maybe psyllium husk, which can be hard on the colon for some dogs with sensitive intestinal issues."
"I hate bugs, but I adore these Bug Bites chocolate squares!  The chocolate is smooth and sweet, and small enough to be a daily indulgence.  Plus, each square comes with a tiny insect flashcard with a photo and factoids for your favorite entomologist.<br /><br />Pull the trigger on this one.  Your sweet tooth will thank you."
"I rarely write reviews, but these pods are so awful, I was hoping to save even one person from wasting their money like I did.  The little green plug barely stays in -- even after twisting it -- so the water is always sloshing out.  And the clear plastic cover is absolutely the worst design.  It is nearly impossible to remove and actually snapped into shards when I tried to open one of the pods.  (And I can attest that those plastic shards are sharp!)  If you are able to actually open the pod, be prepared for the water to splash out from the bottom.  Even if the pods actually worked well and preserved the herbs (which they don't really do), they would not be worth the aggravation or cost.  Like another reviewer said, just put your herbs in a cup with a little water in the bottom and a plastic bag covering the top.  Works perfectly and costs nothing.  Please don't waste your money on this!"
"You need to make sure the pieces are evenly distributed throughout the bag before you microwave it. With my microwave I find 1:30 on high is the best, shake bag well when you first pull it out (for at least 10 seconds). This ensures the hot and spicy seasoning to be evenly coated. Then enjoy, I eat em with a beer."
"Despite several washings, I can not get rid of the industrial plastic smell on the soft rubber parts of this toy, and our dog (lab mix) has absolutley no interest in it, despite favorite treats inside. I can only assume she finds the smell offensive/repellant.<br /><br />If she does ever take an interest in it (I keep trying), I will keep a close eye on the rubber ""rope""- seems like something she may chew through fairly quickly."
"My family and I enjoy the salt & vinegar chips that lays makes as well as the kettle cooked chips, so we wanted to try these chips because we've seen them all over the market. i took a chance and purchased them online on amazon and I regret taking that the chance. We do not like the dry and more on the salty taste of these chips. I will no longer make purchases on items that I can try buying at the store first before investing in buying by bulk and saving online. Do not purchase these chips unless you already tried them before."
My one year old cat ate a few of these and seemed lethargic.  Two weeks later I gave him a large helping of these<br />and I thought he was going to die.  He laid around and would not eat or move for two days.  I will not feed him these<br />again.  Same thing happened to my parent's cat after eating the salmon variety.
"I like pizza.  But regular pizza literally destroys my body (celiac disease and dairy allergy - yes, it does suck).  So my love of food has driven me to learn how to make decent versions of food I like which are gluten and dairy free.  I am now a MASTER pizza chef, to put it modestly.  Practically a PIZZA GOD.  I've got the pizza stone, the piel, found the best gf crust, the best df cheese, and the result is usually pretty great.<br /><br />ANYWAY...<br /><br />I like mushrooms on my pizza, specifically SLICED mushrooms, and I make pizza at home often enough that checking out at the grocery store with 20 or 30 cans of sliced mushrooms draws awkward stares.  The solution, of course, is to order in bulk via Amazon.  Have done this many times, trying out different brands, etc.  I'm almost certain I'd purchased this exact product in the past with no issues...but this latest shipment brought with it a harrowing ordeal involving smelly mushrooms and untopped pizzas.<br /><br />At first I thought I might have gotten a bad can, so I tossed the first stinky one.  Then the next one smelled just as bad.  Now - the smell isn't a rotten smell or an unnatural smell.  The best way I can describe it is a combination of normal canned mushroom smell and... horse shit.  If you don't know what horse shit smells like just imagine dog shit with a lot of hay and some mud mixed in.  So I stopped there and made my pizza without toppings.<br /><br />The next day or two when I made another pizza I decided maybe my sense of smell had been off before and to try opening another can of mushrooms from the same case.  Same fecal smell.  Even after extensive rinsing it smelled like I had been rinsing the mushrooms in an unflushed toilet bowl.  I had my wife smell the can (oh, she LOVES being asked to smell-check gross stuff...actually, no).  She agreed with the horse shit description.  I put the remaining cans back on a high shelf far out of sight.<br /><br />When next I went to the grocery store (actually, Target I think) I got a couple cans of Green Giant sliced mushrooms and later when I used them on a pizza they smelled totally normal and free of ungulate diarrhea.  You can see in the attached image how one of my normal pizzas comes out...with normal mushrooms.<br /><br />So I'm highly disappointed...and it's left me feeling unsure of any Giorgio mushroom cans...and unsure about any organic mushroom cans...and just about canned mushrooms in general.  I like to use fresh when I have them (like, as I write this)...but most of the time when I make a pizza I use canned shrooms.  But I feel deeply scarred by this turd-infused experience and may have trouble trusting any canned mushrooms for a while.  Which is definitely going to cramp my style pizza-wise.  LAME!<br /><br />(In case anyone is wondering, this is not a joke, even if it may be funny to laugh at my stinky mushroom ordeal.  I lived it and I have the battle scars to prove it.)"
"my dog loved it at first but an hour later the plastic bottle cracked!! maybe this toy should be kept ""indoors"" only :("
I used to buy these as healthy snacks at my office cafeteria and consider it better than a bag of potato chips.  These taste very crunchy and tasty.<br /><br />Given the kind of unethical food stories we read about China - we need to see some kind of assurance and facts on the processes that the manufacturer is following to make these.  You just cannot import food stuff and sell in the US as gourmet snack food - there needs to be data backing this.<br /><br />Few example of Chinese food (yuk ...):<br /><br />(1) Melamine(kind of platic) in baby food and milk (so wide spread that 80% of milk in China contained this plastic in 2008)<br /><br />(2) Honey contaminated with ciprofloxacin (antibiotic) - because of which it was banned in the US<br /><br />(3) Soy Sauce made from Human hair (not joking google it if you want)<br /><br />(4) Spurious drugs exported to African countries.<br /><br />Need some good facts and quality controls from the Manufacturers that the chinese producers are complying with some good quality controls.
"First of all, I am aware that this is made for the gun, however after reading the reviews I purchased it and let me say I have never been more dissapointed. In the picture the gold is brilliant, bold, and intense. When I got this product it was oily in appearance and looked like vinegar in color. I used a paintbrush as I read in a previous review. The color is a yellow, maybe a copper tone---nothing like gold. I used part of this for an anniversary cake--I had to drive to the arts and crafts store to purchase Wiltons Gold shimmer to attempt to cover this disaster. I thought $15 was pretty expensive in the first place, but after using the product I am sure it is not worth a single cent. I cannot believe how grotesque this color is. If I wanted a copper/yellow tone I would have just used edible dye---I sure would have saved the money for something else. I bake hundreds of cakes each year, and I am confident to say that this is the worst item I have ever used. Garbage. I have another bottle that should be arriving in the mail in a couple days for the silver color, I will be sending it right back and getting my money back for sure!"
It is hard to stay out of these wonderful cookies! Just the right amount of chocolate chips and the texture is melt-in-your-mouth good!
"I don't know how anybody can eat these. I can't taste anything but salt. I hope this is just a bad batch because nobody else in the reviews complained about this being too salty to eat. I gave it two stars because it is just the right tenderness I was looking for. But unfortunately I can not enjoy any of it. I would have returned it and maybe gave this company another chance, but Amazon has a policy that you can't return groceries."
"the first shipment of this mix was excellent and we used it all, but the second shipment must have been old because it had a flat, sort of rancid taste. i wound up throwing most of it away, which i can't afford to do.  i love bob red mill products but i think i'll shop around for it at the local health food store where it will be more likely to be fresh."
"Sleepytime is a popular tea that has been around a long time due to its high quality. The natural flavors and ingredients have made it a required tea for the cupboard of persons interested in healthy eating for the last 30 years! The predominant flavors are of chamomile and spearmint--but the additional ingredients--including rose buds--create a satisfying, complex blend that is very tasty and soothing. Not only is Sleepytime caffeine-free but it contains herbs that are mildly relaxing and healing for the stomach.  Drink this lovely tea before bed either with or without honey.<br /><br />Sleepytime contains chamomile, spearmint, lemongrass, tilia flowers, blackberry leaves, orange blossoms, hawthorne berries and rosebuds.  The  healing qualities of some the herbs in Sleepytime are listed below, however please note that there is insufficient quantities of each herb to have anything more than a very mild effect.  Blackberry leaves, which are soothing to the stomach, contain tannins which provides a tea-like base for the flowery flavors of chamomile and rosebuds.  Spearmint is one of the milder mints and is also useful to soothe tummy ache.  Chamomile is a wonderful herb that has a relaxing effect; it also can be used to soothe tummy aches, headache, menstrual cramps and is a mild anti-fungal.<br /><br />Celestial Seasonings gets extra points for their packaging: they utilize 100% natural recycled paperboard in their boxes and they don't package each tea bag individually. Instead they use a system of a waxed paper bag inside the box that stays shut when you fold it. It keeps the bags fresh and utilizes less packaging than individually wrapping each bag. The art they use on each box is beautiful as are the quotes and information they put on every surface.<br /><br />Quote from the box:<br /><br />""Ultimately, the bond of all companionship, whether in marriage or friendship, is conversation.""  Oscar Wilde."
"Tortilla soup is one of my favorite soups, and I like both the tomato and chicken broth varieties. Although I didn't expect freshly fried tortilla strips or queso fresco in a canned soup, I did expect something that resembled all other tortilla soups I have tried, that is a LIGHT broth with a mix of vegetables, corn, beans chicken and Mexican spices. This soup is thick - really thick, like the thickest tomato soup you've ever had with a grilled cheese sandwich. It's also sweet, and does not taste in the least like a Mexican soup. Instead, imagine straight tomato soup with a bunch of vegetables, beans and some chicken thrown in.<br /><br />I ended up giving it all away, and, to be fair, one of the people I gave the soup to said her husband really liked it.<br /><br />For a canned soup that much more closely resembles real tortilla soup, try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0014EUB7I"">Campbell's Select Mexican Chicken Tortilla, 18.6-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>."
While I gave it the benefit of the doubt confirmation was ascertained on the second bite that it tastes like vomit.
I ordered this item as I got to see it as recommended by Dr.Sears.. But the pack of 6 with this flavor doesn't work for my baby... My baby didn't like the taste.. I don't know why :(.. Had it been packed with different flavors.. I would have atleast tried the other flavor... As this item is not eligible for returns.. I am just wondering what to do with this...
The flavor of what pops is good but only half the corn pops. I know its not my poper because Started using the oil and salt from these packages and different seeds.
The bags catch fire in my microwave and that leaves most un-popped and extremely over-salted.  This product is inferior to other brands I have tried.
I am very happy with this tea.  I hesitated to order because of price but it comes in a nice tin with 50 round tea bags.  It is great tasting.  I add ginger chips to it and it really is great when I have an upset stomach.  I just recently received my second order.
"I read about pomegranate molasses so I had to try it! I haven't made anything with it yet, just eaten a little bit at a time but WOW is it decadent! It's dark, syrupy, sour, and a little sweet. A dab of this and I forget about dessert. It's just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone. Yum!! I'm going to try making fesenjan next :-)"
"I've been using another type of ant gel for a couple of years now.<br /><br />It worked OK, but it has some less than desirable qualities that are improved on by this product.<br /><br />First the Hot Shot really attracts the ants much better.  Secondly that it works much much faster.  Before I'd put the bait down and have to wait a day or two to really see the results.  NOT SO WITH THE HOT SHOT!!  Put the bait across the ant line and the ants go for it right away and in a few minutes to a half hour or so the infestation is dramatically reduced.<br /><br />This clear gel is much thicker than the Combat product.  A small line as close to the entry point as you can get is all you will need.<br /><br />The only downside to this product that I've come across is that the gel seems to set up in the tip between uses.  A couple of times I've pushed so hard to get it started, that when the tip cleared a big squirt came out all at once (made a bit of a mess and wasted some of the gel).  In the future I'm going to use a toothpick to open the tip before each use.<br /><br />Another nice advantage is that the gel is clear.  The other product is honey colored and after application would sort of dry up like pitch, an amber color.  At times hard to clean out from under a metal carpet seam or in tight corner.  This product is less noticeable.<br /><br />The tip is long enough to be able to push the product into crevices.<br /><br />Hope this helps."
This is really tasty hot chocolate.  I like it much more than the dark chocolate flavor but that is just my preference...
"Beyond GOOD, excellent. Never buying microwave popcorn again, 200-300 for a popcorn maker and your in business...<br /><br />All in one, all the popcorn pops, no hassle, just good popcorn."
I bought this brand as a trial since I am tired of the Pingos.<br /><br />It claims that it is natural. I have no argument on this. But the point is that more than 50% in the bag is over-fried and in brown color. I really suffer eating the over-fried chips. I open some other bags and it looks like the same. So I just throw away all of them. I don't know if I was with bad luck or every bag they are selling is the same. But for sure I will never buy this brand any more.
"This is NOT A SUMMER SAMPLER<br /><br />The majority of this Sampler was hot, including: Hot Eggnog, Hot Apple Cider, Hot Gingerbread Coffee, Hot Caramel Apple, and Golden French Toast Coffee<br /><br />Sound like ""the Perfect Brewed Over Ice K-Cup"" to you?  This was the totality of iced drinks: Vanilla Iced Coffee, Peach Iced Tea, and unsweetened black iced tea.<br /><br />Additionally, there were only 8 varieties rather than the 9 listed on the description.<br /><br />I literally thought they might have mixed my Summer drinks for Holiday drinks, but it was clearly labeled Summer Sampler.<br /><br />Even worse, this item does not generally qualify for a refund.  Beware!"
"My puppy (Shia) and 5yr old (Miss Peaches)loves this food. Once I purchased my new lovely new baby I wanted a puppy food that would be good for her. This brand has no by products in it, but has all the natural ingredients for the well being of your pets, it's the real deal for a healthy growning puppy and the adult dog food my Chihuahua, and Pom loves. I'm sold and I won't change a thing."
I live in Florida and it is now hurricaine season. This product and packaging is perfect when we have no electrical power or when we have to evacuate.
"Jamaica Me Crazy is an awesome smooth coffee, Light Coconut/Vanilla flavorful taste.<br />a good coffee if you don't like real strong coffee.Highly recommend."
This stuff tasted like pipe tobacco smells. My Son didn't like it either and I ended up throwing it out.
"I usually order Plum organic vegetable squeezable pouches for on the go but it comes one flavor per bulk.  So when I saw this variety pack, 8 count POUCHES I decided to order. I recieved it today and it is DRY PACKET food not POUCHES... False Description.  To make it worse I went online clicked on return-i got a message states this item is not returnable.  I feel ripped off with the FALSE DESCRIPTION.... How can you describe DRY PACKET FOOD as POUCHES???"
"I love chipotle. Back here in MA when I live now, it was years before you could find any products with chipotle. Things are better now, but I still have to fetch chipotle things in CA. And I was so ticked off when TSA would not let me take this stuff on the plane. So I have been forced to order this stuff online for years. Of all my sauces though this one is my go to favorite. And it is the roasted garlic-it is a real sauce changer. It adds a complexity to the sauce that is really just different. But I love roasted garlic too. So the best of two worlds combined. I keep other hot sauces around for different ethnic foods, but when I eat hummus (which is a lot) this is the one I reach for in the fridge."
I bought a bunch of these for my mom so she can make persian ice cream.  Received on time and package was very organized.
"These BBQ chips are crisp, well-spiced, & satisfying.  I don't eat as many of these at 1 sitting as I do with regular (Lay's) BBQ chips.<br />We were buying these at Costco for a short while.  The problem with Costco is that when items become very popular, their bulk cost goes up & Costco moves on to carry something else.  Not even Central Market (TX) carries these!  Thanks goodness for Amazon.  I am signing up for the automatic re-ordering program!"
"I first tried Lowrey's Bacon Curls when they were offered at a local club store. Since then, the only way to find them had been to order them streight from the manufacturer, until now. I'd had mixed results with the microwave process. I'd had many bags just burn without popping. Recently...just for fun, I thought I'd see what would happen if I tried lower wattage. It worked!! Now I use my 900 watt microwave vs the 1100 watt microvave I'd initially used."
"I absolutely love this tea.  It's great on a chilly morning; personally, I prefer it to coffee.  It's not overly sweet so as a southern girl, I always add a little sugar to it.  Give it a try.  You won't be disappointed!"
"SOMETHING TO EAT IF YOU'RE STARVING - BUT PLEASE GIVE REAL FOOD TO HUNGRY PEOPLE,<br /><br />What's in Kellogg's Corn Flakes? ""Milled Corn, Sugar, Malt Flavoring, High Fructose Corn Syrup, Salt."" Yes, of course, it also has lots of yummy preservatives such as BHT and a few synthetic vitamins and iron in minute quantities. For nutrition you get basically 100% Carbs from lots of SUGAR and almost NO PROTEIN. Add skim milk, or you'll get saturated fat with a little protein from whole milk. For added nutrition, include a sliced banana and a capful of wheat germ.<br /><br />If you like Corn Flakes, that is your business and you should enjoy them, but this is not health food and it is a very poor value for more than 0.29 cents an ounce [$3.49 per package]. At this price, the inner package's failure to maintain freshness is an even bigger drawback when one thinks of how long it may take to finish 12 ounces of this stuff. Why not use a vacuum-sealed container like Kretschmer's Wheat Germ to preserve freshness? After all, it's in the same price range!<br /><br />So if you are hungry, you are really eating the wrong stuff. SOMETHING TO EAT IF YOU ARE STARVING - BUT PLEASE GIVE REAL FOOD TO OTHER HUNGRY PEOPLE PLEASE!"
"Our dog loves her Bad CUZ, but this toy she loves more than any other.  She's a VERY tough chewer, and it's survived for quite some time with no damage.  One thing - protect your toes with this toy - it's pretty heavy and does get swung around a bit.  I wouldn't recommend this toy if you have low tables with knick-knacks, sensitive shins or teeny kids that may get bonked with it.  Ours has gotten thrown (by the dog) repeatedly down the stairs onto a hard floor and hasn't broken yet.<br />As far as treats to go into it - remember that the rope is knotted inside the jug, so don't put anything into the jug that's soft or the rope will end up smelling REALLY nasty..."
"The barbeque flavor of these chips is really perfect! Just spicy enough, a hint of sweetness, just a little smokey. The chips themselves are extra crunchy and just thick enough to be substantial, but not hard. This makes for a wonderful snack or a great accompaniment for burgers, hot dogs or brats, chicken or just about any casual entree."
"Love these chips, and I don't even like black beans.  Very tasty.  Yum!!  Plus, good for you!"
"THIS WAS MY SECOND ORDER OF THIS PRODUCT.  SOMETIMES ONE BAG CAN BE A LITTLE SALTY, BUT IN GENERAL, WE REALLY LIKE THEM.  I PUT THEM IN OUR MICROWAVE FOR 2 MINUTES AND PRESTO, YOU HAVE WARM PORK RINDS.  BE AWARE, THEY DO NOT MAKING A POPPING SOUND LIKE WHEN YOU MAKE MICROWAVE POPCORN, SO DON'T WORRY.  JUST MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTION AND SHAKE THE BAG WELL TO MOVE THEM AROUND.  YOU CAN'T SEEM TO FIND THEM IN THE STORE, SO IT'S GREAT THAT AMAZON CARRIES THEM ON THEIR SITE.  FOR LESS THAN A DOLLAR A BAG, YOU HAVE WARM FRESH PORK RINDS."
"These are delicious! A very thin wafer roll with a melt in your mouth chocolate/coffee filling. What's not to love about it!!<br />The only reason I don't give it 5 stars it's not because of the wafer itself but because of the condition it arrived, most of them were broken and even melted, I'm sure they were exposed to a very warm environment.<br />Still yummy dough!!!!"
"As with any dog treat, you must monitor your pet while consuming but Greenies are the best! My dogs know exactly when it is Greenie Time!"
"OK, so I sit in the Dawg Pound for NFL games and firmly believe that the Uga dynasty is the best mascot tradition in major college athletics, but my fandom ends at barking at officials and not demonstrating special mettle by munching on snacks designed for ""man's best friend.""<br /><br />Earlier today, I put the treats to a taste test with a pair of dogs that run every morning with their owner....and they ate the biscuits with aplomb. The back of the package has a complete nutritional analysis, but the ""Newman's Own"" name means top quality in every product.<br /><br />Nell Newman continues to do an oustanding job in continuing and expanding the company's vision. And that the good news can be shared with pets simply makes it even more enjoyable."
"I LOVE Green Mountain coffee.  I use it all the time for my k cups.  I got a sample of the Green Mountain Hot Cocoa and thought it would be the best.  I actually threw it out.  I tried several times to drink it.  It tasted bitter and like chemicals.  I have tried samples of the other brands of hot cocoa and this by far was the worst.  I was so surprised because I adore their coffee.  I personally would not recommend this.  Maybe it is the soy I don't know.  It just tasted very, very odd.  I still would recommend their coffees though!  Just to be fair I did add chocolate redi whip.  But I add that to all of my hot cocoa and it always tastes good."
"Although its always nice to find gluten free products available to those who suffer from Celiac Disease, its also troubling to find many of these products also are high in sugar. I found this to be extremely too sweet for my taste. If I purchase something that is chocolate I want to taste chocolate not be overwhelmed by sugar.Rice flour in itself is high glycemic and with the added sugar this product made me feel ill from the sugar content. I have been baking for years the old fashioned way with whole wheat but after developing Celiac I no longer could consume it. I learned later from a nutritionist that sugar was also a problem for people who have Celiac. Through trial and error I found this to be so true. Can't the makers of these mixes back off on the sugar? I removed the chips as well as they were too sweet. Other than that its okay for a rice flour mix cause we all know rice does not compare to whole wheat."
"the first moment you bite into this cracker, you will notice the difference.  This tasty, crunchy, organic cracker is perfect with soup or salad.  It is certified organic, using quality ingredients.  The cracker is dry, not greasy or oily like a typical potato chip.<br /><br />comes in several different varieties and flavors.<br /><br />* recommended *"
"Bought a Keurig machine several months ago (which I love BTW!) and started out buying different variety packs of coffee's so I could try all kinds of new flavors and blends.  Eventually I wanted to decide upon something that would be my everyday standard.  In the mornings like a nice solid bold roast that's rich and doesn't get watered down when making a full cup out of the Keurig machine.<br /><br />Right away I knew the Emeril's was the best choice, the Easy Bold is perfect my morning Joe.  At night I go with a lighter blend (from Supermarket using the MyK-Cup) but Emeril's Easy Bold is perfect for my mornings."
"Having tried just about every other vegan jerky item on the market I was excited to find one that is completely gluten-based, offering a very reasonable protein-to-calories ratio (~10%), a reasonable price-per-ounce, plus great reviews to boot.  Got the product and discovered to my great chagrin that it requires refrigeration after opening!!  Not only does that fly in the face of what jerky is supposed to be, it is not disclosed anywhere in the Amazon product description.  Ouch!  So much for taking these 4oz packages on the trail, or anywhere else for that matter.<br /><br />Also, be aware that the product -- unlike several competitive vegan jerky products -- is made in Taiwan which could mean it uses Chinese gluten.  That's a source I personally try to avoid because of significant food safety issues in the past.  However, I contacted the manufacturer and was told that their gluten is ""imported from either Australia, Western Europe or the USA......most all our ingredients are from these sources.  We manufacture in Taiwan because they have ways of cooking with soy and wheat gluten that are not found in the west.""<br /><br />All that said, taste is pretty good and the ""wet"" packaging gives it a softer texture than competitive products (which I personally still prefer)."
The product will not dissolve!!! And it tastes OK (drinkable) but more like cool aid or orange soda even when added to orange juice. I cannot speak to the effectiveness of the product as dissolving is vitally important and it has a problem with that. Appears I've wasted some money.
"Despite reading the reviews of others on how hard this was to open, I was confident I knew the secret so would be fine. Not so. No matter what I did, couldn't pop off the clear plastic lid. Instructions showed the bottom part screwing off, didn't. Husband couldn't even do it and he opens everything for me. He finally got it open, only held about half of the aspargus which is what I wanted it for so tossed it in the garbage and then bought one from Progresso that we both can open. Note to self, pay MORE attention to what people are saying."
"I just checked with the Post Office here where I am stationed.  People can mail dried fruits and vegitables through the US Postal System.  I tried to order these walnuts to be delivered while I am overseas and can not get them.  My order was refused because according to Amazon ""they can't ship food"" overseas.  From doing some research I found that the reson they can't ship to an APO address is the vender uses either FedEx or UPS and they can't ship to an APO address.  It doesn't bother me that the vender can't ship, or for that mater won't take the initiative to sell to US Service People overseas, it is they Lied about it."
"I was looking for gluten-free pastas because I am trying to eat gluten-free. However, on this pasta, even though it says 'gluten-free', says it contains 'semolina'. What is semolina? Quite frankly, it is wheat, and it is known to have high quantities of gluten.<br /><br />I have never tried this pasta, so I don't know how good it is, but there is one thing I know- that will never change as long as DeBoles uses semolina in their products (and still dares to call the product 'gluten-free'. I can smell a lawsuit from here when someone severely intolerant thinks it's alright to eat this product."
"If you love peanut butter but hate the fat and sugar, then this product is for you. It is fantastic in smoothies and shakes--has a real peanut butter taste. At 45 calories a serving, I have it almost every day with my Shakeology! I will always keep this in the house."
"After I enptied the can, I noticed it was black in an area at the top of the can and appeared to be corroded. Of course I was afraid to eat the fruit, so I threw it away. I am waiting for a response from Native Forest to ascertain the type of metal can and if it is harmful. One would expect if they went to the effort to be certified as organic, they would use safe canning. I will post an addendum w/ their response."
"PRO:<br />-my dogs (maltese and poodle mix) go crazy over these treats. they are very obedient once they know that i'm holding these treats in my hand<br />-since they're freeze dried, i don't have to worry about these treats drying out<br />-although it comes in big cubes, i'm able to cut the cubes into smaller pieces with a plastic knife in order to lengthen the usage out of my stash of these dog treats<br />-my containers always came with very little crumbs/powder at the container's bottom<br /><br />CON:<br />-not uniform sizes<br />-not cheap<br /><br />Conclusion: still a great product, but need some modifications<br />*Since every morsel appears to be so flavorful, all my dogs need is a pinkie nail size amount to reward them.<br />*It may SEEM like the crumbs/powder is useless, but actually, it is still somewhat useful. I used the powder to coat bland chewy dog treats, dog food, toys, etc."
"Uncle Lee's Green Tea is about on par with Tazo Green Tea.  They are the two best green teas I've had.  I agree with the other reviewer that it isn't bitter or stale like many green teas.<br /><br />I gave some to my mother and it has quickly become her favorite.  Now she knows that there are differences in teas.  She won't go back to Lipton and other big names.  Tazo green tea might just edge it out, but Uncle Lee's is considerably less expensive."
"I ATE BEER NUTS ALL THROUGH MY CHILDHOOD YEARS AND INTO MY 20'S. AFTER THAT YOU COULDN'T BUY THEM IN UPSTATE NY. WHEN A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE SAID HE WAS LOOKING FOR THEM, I CHECKED OUT THE NET TO FIND THEM ON YOUR SITE.<br />THEY ARE HORRIBLE. WHAT A DISSAPOINTMENT. THEY TASTE MORE LIKE SPANISH PEANUTS WITH OUT THE SALT. THE BEER NUTS I REMEMBER WHERE SWEET AND SALTY, JUST LIKE THE LABEL SAYS. THESE PEANUTS ARE BLAND, BLAND, BLAND."
"When i first opened the box it looked perfectly fine. the expiration date was april 2012 the bag seemed fine. That is until i went to open the corner. The resealable pouring spout was already opened. The seal is supposed to be intact until it is opened for the first time. To me it looks as if someone had reused this bag. Im not entirely sure if it is even the same dog food. Someone could have just put in what ever they feel like and called it ""Canidae"" and charged me $55.00. The dog food looked different as well. it had the same texture but the pieces were all bigger and a darker color. I had a bag of canidae that i had from before so i compared them! I will not be feeding this to my dog. I guess lesson learned from buying on the internet. maybe my story will make you think twice. on the bright side the price was cheaper and the shipping to hawaii for me was less than a week! free shipping i may add! So buy at your own risk! My dogs health isnt worth taking a chance that it could be canidae in there! I want to be certain that it is 100 % canidae!!<br /><br />-Phillip"
"My cat had a severe allergic reaction from this food resulting in deep, crusty, oozing, lesions on his face around his mouth, up to his ears, and down to his neck. On close examination of the ingredients, one unusual additive is sunflower seed oil in this and other Fussie Cat flavors. He's back on his old food and healing nicely. I'll stick with the less expensive brands and save on vet bills from now on."
"I am not a coffee snob but craved coffee when I am pregnant, so I ordered some decaf.  I have to say i never touched again and its not worth the trouble ( not much of course) of making it"
what can I say... if you've had popchips in the past and love them... then no better place to pick them up... I love these chips and have bought them without an issue from Amazon.<br /><br />Thanks
I have been told by my veternarian that Glucosomin treats with chicken cause urinary problems in dogs and so I wanted to return 3 unopened packages (of 3 each)and the company will not accept returns.  Ridiculous.  They must know how bad they are for animals.
I believe gerber may have mixed apricots with the peaches. It now has a sour after taste and my son hates it.
"and they definitely do, being as i tried out this whole 24 pack. They taste alright and not too much fat or calories but i dont know why but they give me gas!! At first I was confused but then I realised when I ate them is when Id later stink up the room. Never again!"
I like hot stuff but this thing was a killer.  I put a tiny dab of it on a toothpick and was sick the rest of the day.
I am addicted to Popchips - I love the cheddar flavored ones. I don't crave cheetos anymore which I was addicted to.  I know eat a bag of these and my craving is gone. They are actually healthy and for only 100 calories a bag and around 3 grams of fat - it is a much better choice than cheetos. They are very crunchy and full of flavor. I am ordering these again.
I purchased this for my retriever who's really active and saw absolutely no change from these tablets.  He gets tons of exercise and is still really busy all the time so I figured something like this would calm him down a little bit.  No effect whatsoever.
"I was disappointed by these eucalyptus leaves - they have a stale, oregano-like smell. Ask your local florist to get you some fresh leaves!"
"I am enjoying the recent purchase of PopChips, so far I have enjoyed all the flavor choices.  The individual serving bags make it easy for me to have just the right portion serving with my meals or if I have a craving for a snack.  Thanks for the product. Jean Roth"
"I bought this tug toy because of the reviews...However, none of my three dogs had any interest in them, even when I put their favorite snacks in them. I dog is a big chewer, one is a medium chewer, and one is too old to chew! Not one would go near it...Also, it does not look like the picture. It is entirely in purple, and the tug is all purple and rubber... This is the only toy I ever bought that all three dogs disliked. It has been a week, and I keep giving them the toys, but no luck.  I personally think it is too awkward and heavy..Fell on my bare foot, and it hurt somewhat.  I think you could make this with a plastic soda bottle, for nothing...<br />  Sorry for the bad review....The review is from the dogs, and not me!  I paid quite a bit for 2 of them, and I<br />need to figure out what to do with them...paid too much to throw them away.. maybe make a bird feeder?"
These are as good or better than the Deep Fried ones you get at Theme Parks across the country!!!
My sweet pooch loves these treats! She will do anything I ask as long as I have a hand full of these babies. And they are all natural and don't hurt her tender tummy. Great product!
I tried this flavor within a variety pack and LOVED IT!  I usually add cream and sugar to my coffee.  With this k cup I added coconut creamer and found that I did not have to add any sugar!  It was so sweet and light and tasted just like a pina colada.  I absolutley love this k cup and am planning to sign up for subscribe and save on this one!
"I love pasta but I hate the stuffed feeling I get after eating it and the high carb content.  I BOOUGHT these noodles FROM AMAZON because you can get them for a GREAT PRICE and FREE SHIPPING.  Unlike other reviewers I actually read the information provided for the customer so I can make an informed purchase.  I've had these noodles in both hot and cold dishes and they are fabulous.  No carbs, no calories, and no weight gain.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!!"
"This tea is tasty with a slight smoky taste and the tang of green tea that I like so much.  However, there's not very much tea for this much can.  It is far from green regarding resource use and distant shipping of a lot of metal.  I've switched to one that comes in a pound bag.  Will see how I like it."
"I received this tea today, a wet, chilly, dreary day with no promise but rain and sniffles; I immediately came home and opened it and got the hot pot going. The aroma that escaped upwards from the can was heavenly; delicate, alluring, definitely Earl Grey but with whispers of bergamot, a lemony, citrusy warmth that made me feel good immediately. I put aside all other endeavours for a time and gave myself up to a retreat with this wonderful light tea. Don't brew it more than 4 minutes; let the essence of the bergamot exude from the tea. Both your sense of taste and your sense of smell will be the better for having indulged in this tea. A lovely cap on a grey, ugly day.<br /><br />Rishi Earl Grey Tea is 100% Organic Fair Trade tea, grown by and harvested by the ethnic peoples of the Yunnan Province of China from tea trees planted in 696 A.D. By buying Fair Trade teas, the minority peoples who grow the tea benefit, through community developments and direct trade. The benefit to the purchaser is in knowing that they are doing a good thing for the earth and for the small farmer. I've just started seeing Fair Trade items coming onto the market, and I try to patronize the small farmer. You won't be cutting any corners by drinking this tea; it's truly a great beverage. It also says on the can that one serving can be used multiple times, so don't cavalierly throw it out after the first cup. Very recommended."
"My two boxes absolutely LOVE these freeze dried liver treats; it is one of their favorites.  Both dogs do their kidney bean dances in the kitchen when we take the lid off.  The only bad thing is the treats are small and they only recommend a few daily.  (But, I guess that's not too much of a bad thing given these are a little pricer than the average dog treat)"
"I purchased this for my baby, but as soon as I opened it smelled pretty bad. I tried to give it to my baby and she hated it, she threw up. I don't recommend this product. Gerber Rice Cereal is much better."
"We have loved this product until the last few days.  As I was playing w/my daughter who is 20 months, she said ""mommy tummy hurts"" and I heard it gurgling.  Her dad heard and said:  ""...well I opened a new can of Oatmeal yesterday, and it smelled horrible, looks very different than past cans"".  Sure enough, I opened it and it was horrible smelling and looked bad  (as noted in other reviews, dark grey flakes mixed in, much darker than normal).  There MUST be something wrong - I plan to contact the company tomorrow and would NOT recommend right now."
"I've tried a few of the different energy shots, and found that the ""5 hour energy"" have a flowery note (lavender?) in all of their flavours.<br /><br />I can't say I like it. The _effect_ is ok, but the flavour is like bad/flat orange pop, and is otherwise uninspiring. I think I'd prefer the more standard 'berry' flavour of other shots vs this one."
Salt and vinegar is just ok to me.<br />They are not in the same league of utz Salt and vinegar potato chips.<br /><br />Just ok<br /><br />Not enough taste to them.
"I would never have ordered this had I known I was only going to be sent 12, and one of them was open and leaking powdered spice out. I complained to Amazon, and I know from experience that they always have awesome customer service. Since I just got my package today and just opened it now, I have to wait a bit to hear back from them on this issue...will keep you updated. I just wanted you guys to know that even though it states 144 packets, it is NOT. Must be a misprint? Double check with Amazon before you order this. What sounds like an awesome deal is a meh deal if you are getting only 12 of them."
"I have a 2 1/2 year old 60 pound German wirehair pointer.  We feed this food during hunting season due to his increased metabolic needs.  He burns so many calories, he eats 8 cups of this food a day (with zeal).  We use the large bites to help keep the tarter and plaque off of his teeth (and to slow his eating).  Due to the high quality of this food, he can keep up his energy, keep his weight up, and recover more quickly from scrapes/bumps from running the field.  Our vet's exact words were, ""Your dog is an example of perfect health.""  You may think the price on this food is high, but it is worth it.  You get what you pay for.  Also, consider the canned version of this food.  It is a nice way to feed/hydrate a dog after a long day hunting - just give them an hour to settle down first.  On a side note, we feed Diamond Naturals Beef and Rice in the off season.  We have no digestive issues transitioning from one to the other (we switch over a period of a few weeks)."
Love this tea. Has a very mild flavor but that's enough for me. Received some as a Christmas gift a few years ago. Been addicted ever since. Just can't find it in a store any more. Have to order it here.
"I wish it was not so expensive, but it is absolutely worth the price.  If you care about feeding your dog a quality, grain-free food -- this is it!"
"These pork skins have a great taste. Very fresh ""homemade"" taste. The cooking procedure can be a bit tricky though. I have a 1000w microwave with a turn table and did not get the same results with each bag. The first bag I tried with 1 minute, and additional 15 second intervls, stopping at 1min, 15 seconds. Several skins had not yet cooked. So I rolled the end of the bag back up and gave it 15 more seconds. Still some did not fully ""explode"" or ""bloom"".  The second bag I started with 1 minute, 30 seconds. Slightly better results, but again I needed to re-roll the end of the bag and give it another 15-30 seconds, still using the 15 second intervals for best results.  The third bag I started with 2 minutes (which is also the amount of time that is used on my popcorn setting) and the results were not as good. Too many had over-cooked and were too hard to eat.<br />My suggestion would be to stick with the 1 minute with 15 second intervals, listening closely to the sound. (They emit a slight hissing sound when they expand).  As soon as the bag has fully opened and the hissing sound subsides, it's a good sign you have reached the optimal result.  This item is a little more work than just picking up a bag of ready to eat at the store, but the improved flavor is worth it. To me anyway.  The jury is still out on whether the ""healthy"" claim can hold water.  I will continue to use restraint and only endulge with this treat on occassion.  Good Eats!"
"I love these foods my first son devoured them happily and now my second son also loves them. This fruit mix has a great variety my sons both love the peach oatmeal banana best. Overall a great product high quality ingredients and they don't taste half bad, I of course had to try them if my boys loved them."
"In one of the reviews of the Yogourmet incubator someone wished for a yogurt maker that was more like a toaster.  They wanted to put the milk in and take yogurt out.  This can almost be done with the Yogourmet Machine and the CBA culture.  Here's how.  Purchase two quart boxes of Organic Valley Whole shelf stable milk.  You find these not in the Dairy case but out on store shelves.  Then purchase a package of Organic Valley Non-Fat dry milk.  Are you good with this so far?  The only tricky part is warming the shelf stable boxed milk up to 77°.  I took a big cooking pot and put it in the sink and set the two closed boxes of milk in the pan and filled it with 80° tap water.  Around a half hour later the milk was the right temperature.  I ran some scalding water into my Yogourmet batch container for a mini-sanitize and to warm it slightly.  Then I added the two boxes of shelf stable milk.  Into this I mixed around 3 ounces of powdered milk using a hand mixer.  Verify that your milk is the correct temperature and put 4 ounces of the milk into a cup and mix in the two packages of the CBA starter.  Now pour and stir this back into the batch container and put the container in the Yogourmet incubator and add sufficient 77° water around the batch container and plug in the unit.  In 12 hours you will have your yogurt the easy way.  No heating, no cooling just making Yogurt the easy ""like toast"" way."
"Stocking stuffer gift for family.  Love this brand & blend.  Full bodied, not too dark, not too weak.  Just right.  This has become a family favorite that everyone looks forward to receiving."
"First off I'm a huge Heinz Ketchup fan and never thought I could like a condiment as much as that but let me tell you this ranks right up there!! I believe the balance of Mayo, Olive Oil, and Black Pepper is perfect, not too spicy like the previous reviewer stated and this is coming from me who cannot eat anything spicy at all.  Sometimes I'll combine both Heinz Ketchup and the Cracked Black Pepper Mayonaise to create a very tasty addition to plain and boring sandwiches.  I also like to add Soy Sauce or Terryaki Sauce to add it to make an Asian Style Creamy Sauce to add to Chicken or Steak dinners.  I'll just add on a closing note I was not a huge fan of Mayonaise before I tried this but I have to say I am a HUGE fan now!"
I bought these Celestial Teas for my son. He really enjoys drinking them.(needless to say I am pleased he does). Thank you Amazon.com. for the choices and prices!!.
Had no taste and after the heat of the dish it was on turned them to a leathery tecture. Better off buying the high price truffles.
"According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats."
Truffle oil  makes a wonderful addition to most chef's repertoire. It allows you to infuse the aroma and part of the taste of the truffle. I purchased a finger sprayer and use it to allow the oil to create a mist over simple dishes like ravioli/butter/capers/procusitto and parmesan.<br /><br />Most cooks are unaware that the product (infused olive oil) even exists. Used in the fashion above it can be misted in many recipes to add an exquisite taste at a reasonable price. Truffles can cost up to $400/lb making it an ingredient unavailable (unless purchased on line)and un-affordable.<br /><br />I am sure that I will return to buy more once my current supply exhasts.
"The was a nasty tasting dinner, had not taste to and little hot.  I will not purchase this type of dinner anymore.  Though Hormel has other dinners I would purchase but not this one.  There is zero(0) rating, would like a refund!"
The new Greenies are so much easier for our dog to chew up. She only gets 1-2 per week but enjoys them each time. Buying them via Amazon always saves us money.
I opened a can and it smelled like cigarettes which I was informed was bad bacteria.  I reported this to Amazon whom I got it from and they sent me another 6 pack for replacement BUT it also smelled badly...At this point I gave up trying. I am all for organic but this stuff was poor in my opinion.  Allot of it seemed like hard rice and it smelled like cigarettes and bad bacteria.  I wouldn't buy it again.
i ordered a lot of this licorice but i am so disappointed that they are very old and hard i wanted to return them and get my money back but i just found out i can not return them i am so upset and i want to get my money back.
"This is the worst ""coffee"" I have ever tasted....<br />I am extrememly disappointed in this product. Puroast House Blend tastes like chickory ~ no coffee smell, no coffee taste ~ and NO RETURNS! Now I am stuck with a $22. bag of beans."
Our family loves SPAM and Amazon makes it so easy and such a great deal to buy in bulk.  The 7-ounce size is perfect for our use.  Amazing what you can use SPAM for.  Add it to all your favorite recipes in place of other meats!  Super convenient to have it come in automatic shipments without having to give it a second thought!
But you will enjoy ever step. I gained 5 lbs within a month of buying this 12 pack of full sized bags. Damn it! They should warn you about this! Tastes awesome though. When I finish my crash diet I will order another box (case?). :-)
"I feed Hills Science diet to my pet because I love him and the vet tells me I should. But in all honesty, this product has what is quite certainly the worst snap-lock reseal that I have ever encountered. It is painfully difficult to get it to close properly; and even when it is resealed as best it can be there are still gaps on the side that allow air in to oxidize the product.<br /><br />Packaging IS important. It is no better for your pet to live on stale, oxidized food than it would be for you. Oxidized fats are also called rancid. If you imagine how healthy a rancid diet is for a human... well, you get the idea. This is about more than just inconvenience.<br /><br />I am posting this review for all the Hills Science diet products with this kind of packaging. If you have had the same experience as me with this product, please take the time to let this company know about it.<br /><br />I love my animal. I want to keep feeding him what the vet tells me is good for him. But this quite literally the worst reseal that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter.<br /><br />Theo."
"Love original flavor PopChips, it reminds me so much of Munchos.  I love that there is a healthier alternative that actually truly tastes good!  BBQ flavor is excellent too.  Although I love salt and vinegar chips, I wasn't crazy about their version.  The sour cream and onion and the cheddar were also so-so.  Out of all the flavors, original is my favorite.  You don't feel you're compromising anything with this alternative chip.  Way to go PopChips!"
"I must be in love if I'm mulling over a 12 pack of big bags for myself. I love the crunch, intense curry flavor, seediness, and the fact they are gluten free. These are one of the more original savory snacks you can find. They're very hard so you need good teeth and I love the substantial curry flavor that is not ""kind of indian"" tasting."
"While I think this product is good, I'm disappointed that they reduced the weight of the product from 18.25 oz to 16.25 oz. Has anyone else noticed how difficult it is to read the type used for the weight, the 6 looks very much like an 8.  Same size box, less product, hmmmm."
ordered some from an amazon-fulfilled associate. Normal amazon shipping etc...The cigars were cracked and stale. How does chewing gum shatter and break? No way it was fit for consumption.<br />Easy return process.
"Well this review is specifically for the Sea Salt flavor of these chips. I so wish I had tried another flavor, Dill or a couple others sound good but I will never know. I am not a fan of the flavor I had. Or better yet the lack of flavor. These tasted like health food more than I had hoped ( Like rice cakes ) and I wanted to write a 1 star review but felt it somewhat dishonest as the other flavor may be ok, others seem to like these but I will never try another and still have so many bags left. Grrrrr"
"This is my daughter's favorite. Lindt chocolate is one of the best I know on the market. But: this time I want to review also this shipper. This shipper deserves 10 stars!<br />The chocolate was shipped on days with extremely high temperatures and I was worried in what shape it's going arrive to. Surprise was on my side: all chocolates were in zipped food storage bag, which was inside of small styro-foam cooler together with 4 ice packs. And all that neatly accommodated inside of clean white carton box.<br />When I opened the cooler, the contain was still very cold! I could not be impressed more. And all that effort for value of $30 merchandise with the free shipping!!!! WOW!!!"
Sugar free instant chocolate pudding/pie filling is priced low and but tastes just like unpleasant metallic which I never expected it to be. Was disappointed and will not order sugar-free again.
"This turned out fantastic, a little sweeter than I expecting but still great. May even consider this a dessert wine. Its nice using Cornucopia kits as they come complete with all the supplies you need, corks,labels,toppers,etc. I only use distilled water in the making of the wine, dont want to chance it with anything else. They have always turned out great. Give it a try.....The Farmwiner"
"Was so disappointed to discover that HappyBaby changed Super Salmon!  My little girl LOVED the old formula, and it had more protein and calories than this new version.  The new version also has more sugar and sodium than the previous version, and it has a completely different taste and texture - she won't touch it.  We will not be buying it again."
Love this sugar.  I also get muscavado sugar and they are both great to use in place of regular white sugar. Recommend!
What more can I say. Barley Edible - Crunch on Sugar.  Did come on time but have a feeling that they wanted this unloaded because it didn't sell or maybe bad batch.  Doesn't make you sick or anything like that but you can actually find yourself crunching on sugar like you put a sugar cube in your mouth.  Kids probably don't care.  Hope this helps.
"When I read the reviews, I noticed someone mentioned the box was light.  It is, but it holds a lot - these pork rinds are compact; they expand when cooked, so there's a lot more in the box than it looks like.<br /><br />As snacks go, these are high in protein and low in carbohydrate.<br /><br />I think this is a really good value, and these are very flavorful - I especially enjoy them with bean dip.<br /><br />The only thing that I'd change is, I'd like a lightly salted version; I don't always want that much salt."
"It's all organic and it's on PETA's (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) list of ""CRUELTY-FREE"" brands.  Did you know that the leading brands of dog foods conduct horrible and cruel tests on laboratory dogs?  Plus it is delivered to my door and no shipping charge (Super Saver Shipping), and costs less than the product I used to buy, saving me time and money. Oh yeah, and my dogs love it!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00139TT72"">Newman's Own Organics Adult Dog Food Formula, 12.5-Pound Bag</a>"
"The kettle chip itself is crisp, crunchy and good, although somewhat greasy.  Over coated with the flavoring causing mouth burn when it was not expected in a chip with Rosemary flavoring.  Leaves greasy, gritty residue on fingers after two or three chips."
"This is a great assortment and price...I only give it 4 stars because the peppermint is very weak in peppermint, so I add extract. Nice cocoa flavor to all, tho. Reminds me of ""homemade"""
"I tried the hot n spicey flavor . ..  wasnt top on my list... and then i got this, and omg. I love LOVE  LOVEEEEE it. Thats all im going to say:P"
"This is a difficult review to write.  I have reflux and coffee is a major trigger.  I LOVE good coffee, dark, strong, robust coffee.<br /><br />I was so happy to find this product and had hoped I could ""have my coffee and drink it, too.""  It is not to be.  I would rather have nothing than drink this.<br /><br />Coffee is such a personal thing.  I know most people drink it because they are addicted to caffeine (otherwise there would be NO on buying the majority of the coffee sold in grocery stores).  I drink coffee because I absolutely love the taste (I normally drink decaf everything so caffeine is not a factor for me).<br /><br />For those who absolutely cannot have coffee and aren't particular about flavor, I think this product will be a godsend.  Just like the gluten free products are godsends for celiacs, but you won't catch me eating them either!"
"The chips are deliciously spicy and super crispy.  It takes a second for the heat to hit but<br />when it does, it's AWESOME!  Love these chips and will continue to buy for a long time."
"Plant shipped almost immediately, and arrived in excellent shape. (I was worried; a heavy frost hit while it was in transit, but it was glossy and happy right out of the box.) The pot was also labeled with clear growing instructions. Now it's up to me to baby the new arrival until she's old enough to make vanilla!"
I have been taking this juice now for a few years. I would not be without it! It gives me energy and makes me feel good. It also has lots of antioxidants in it which are good for you. I take one ounce each morning on an empty stomach. That's all I need to feel good and have energy.
"You can get this same product for .40 per can at Petsmart (when on sale, which is quite often), or .44 per can at Walmart; i.e. $9.60 for 24 cans at Petsmart and $10.56 for 24 cans at Walmart."
Not too dry<br />Not too wet<br />Not too hard<br />Not too soft<br /><br />Perfect for when you want to give your dog a treat and are heading out the door.  By the time you open the door and turn around to check on him the treat has been chomped to bit and swallowed  not fear of a choking while you walk out.
"This is by far the best coffee I've ever had. If you don't want to be addicted to a particular brand/flavor, then do not try this. Otherwise, you will be hooked. I have also tried their cinnamon blend, which I did not care for as much (seemed to be too strong of a cinnamon flavor, and I love cinnamon). Check out prices at their website first though, as they may be cheaper there."
"I've found that young cats and elderly ones have an easy time with this flavor. I've always added at least 2 tablespoons of water to the ""pate"" form of Friskies' food. It certainly doesn't diminish the flavor from what I can tell of the cats' dishes that are licked so clean I sometimes think they look better than when I wash the dishes."
"Unfortunately, most of the flavor in peanut butter is in the oil (fat).  Here they remove that and then tell you to put in water to replace it.<br /><br />You won't end up with peanut butter; you end up with thin, slightly peanut-flavored 'stuff'.  Buy it but don't expect anything else."
"So I bought this to use with my 750ml Torani syrup because the description states it's a universal fit for these bottles. However, the cap is too wide and the straw was too long. I ended up cutting the straw to fit and wrapping plastic around the top so the cap will fit. The price was cheap so I didn't feel like returning it."
"Most of the pill pockets have arrived crumbled or partially broken.<br /><br />The problem is the pocket dough is so inelastic that it falls apart at the slightest touch.<br /><br />Pill pocket needs to go back to the drawing board and come up with a<br />pocket worthy of its name.  It can't be that hard to create a dough to form a sturdy, malleable pocket."
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00769ZSVO"">180 Snacks Almond Pops With Cranberries 17 oz Value Bag</a><br /><br />I have Celiac Disease, and while shopping I picked up a bag of these snacks because they are gluten free. So YUMMY, I had to have more and found them on Amazon and ordered 3 bags.I will be saving them for our trip south for the winter. They are absolutely the best!!"
"Thought I was ordering summer tea flavors, got leftover winter garbage. I will not buy from this seller again. I HATE iced coffee, much less gingerbread and eggnog flavors! I cannot believe I just spent that amount of money on crap that I will not ever drink. Should have waited until Walmart carried it! Does Keurig know this stuff is being sold under such false advertisements? Yes, I know it says flavors may be substituted. That would be fine if they were more teas. If I had wanted gross iced coffee flavors, I would have ordered such!<br /><br />On the up side, the peach tea I received was very good. Otherwise, don't waste your money!"
"This oatmeal tastes great, and it has nice texture because it's steel cut. It's healthier and contains more fiber then regular mushy oatmeal. It's extremely good for you and the texture is amazing but still - it has no taste. Some people say that it has a""nutty taste"" but to me- it has no taste at all. However I cut a banana, and put a little sweetener and voila! - delish! I am now addicted to this oatmeal!"
"After eating Thai sticky rice at our local Thai restaurant, I wanted to be able to enjoy this tasty dish at home.  I purchased the steamer, basket, cheese cloth and rice kit.  It arrived quickly and carefully packaged.  Complete instructions were included, which enabled me to make great sticky rice on my first try.  Import Foods also offers a full list of Thai receipes, along with a list of the ingredients needed, and the ability to simply click and order the needed items.  They offer an easy to use web buying experience and excellent quality products. I will definitely order from them again."
"Having lots of problems with Green Mountain cups. Coffee is fine, but plastic seems heavier than other brands and does not fully drain into cup, but drips considerably when removing to dispose. Will probably choose other brands in the future instead. Have been using K-Cups for over a year and only have had problems with this brand."
"My husband really enjoys baking. Not the mixed Bisquick and Mayo together to make biscuits kind, the traditional kind of baking. This flour behaves very well and doesn't leave that floury aftertaste that you can get with cheaper flours. We've been very impressed."
Pure toxic garbage. Eat poison if you want to. Toxic metals. Go ahead and buy this junk and feed yourself poison. Look at all the high ratings. Apparently people love eating toxic metals. Not harmful? Would you eat sodium mercury phosphate? Enjoy your metals.
"Dear Raisin Bran,<br /><br />Less Raisin, more Bran.<br /><br />- Sincerely, ""Someone who had to eat this because she had no better cereal atm."""
there is no way that there is a decent amount  of ghost pepper in this sauce.  i have habernero sauce that is way hotter than this.<br /><br />according to the scovile scale that should be impossible.  this was a waste of money
"the kids enjoyed it. Very cute idea. The charm and chain could have been nicer , but great for the price."
Product is good; my cats like it.  But the price just keeps climbing.  I will have to train my cats to eat cheaper cat food.
"Switch has been the first ""soda alternative"" that I've LOVED! It's got a delightful fresh fruit flavor, refreshing bubbles, and no aftertaste. It is sweet and juicy tasting, reminds me a little of Orange Crush. The tangerine flavor adds just the right note to peak your interest and overcome becoming just another orange drink. However, the price point of just at $1 a can prevents me from keeping it stocked in our home. Still, I would recommend it for an occasional treat."
"What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets. I am also a big fan of Stash products, or rather of all the other stash products I have tried.<br />I purchased a case of all 4 varieties,  (when i say i drink iced tea, i am not kidding) and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my 16 ounces water bottle.<br />I finally found that i needed to dissolve 2 packets in a small bit of hot water first (if not the tea clumped on me), and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatable.<br />Over all I am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market."
"I have never tasted such a poor excuse for a cocoa drink. It has such a bad aftertaste that I checked the box to see if I ordered sugarfree by mistake! I will toss this  and chalk it up to a loss but if you are reading this, dont buy this brand. Its downright awful!"
"Great way to enjoy pizza on a low carb diet.  We even put a little bit of sauce over the ricotta cheese (there are plenty of low carb spag sauces in the grocery store). I also bake the crust for about 5 minutes before I put everything else on and then bake it again, otherwise the crust does not get cooked enough."
"Tried this with 40% off since Nong Shim instant noodle is my favorite, my ten year old son like it very much, I would like this with the stronger flavor."
"I have purchased this item in a larger can before and it is great mango pulp for cooking, desserts, etc.<br /><br />One of the six cans had a huge dent and it would have been obvious before pack was placed in shipping box.  Items were packaged very well so I don't see how this could have happened during shipping since the outside box had no signs of damage.  It is too much of a hassle to return all 6 cans because of one damaged can.  And I need one can for mango cupcakes that I'm making this weekend.  Due to anosmia, the dented can will probably be thrown away because I can't tell if it is good or bad.  I will probably not purchase this item again from Amazon and will buy locally if I can find it."
"I'll admit this product makes a great loaf in the bread machine (use the dark setting, then let the moisture air out)... it has great texture, lightness, rises well, and has really good flavor.<br /><br />However, I found this product to be almost indigestable Even one piece in the morning with breakfast produces gastrointestinal distress all day. I've eaten many other gluten-free products (and occasionally some gluten ones) and have never run across this effect with any other flour blend. Before I figured out this bread was the culprit, I thought I had a stomach virus.<br /><br />In skimming reviews here and elsewhere, I've found a good number of people have had the same issue. I wrote to the company and they said that some people have trouble with sorghum and millet flours. The sorghum flour is the first ingredient, so that may be the case. I do think this bread dough is more glue-like than gluten products, so that may be part of the trouble. The Baking & Pancake Mix and the Brownie Mix seem to be fine for me, they have different ingredients. You can also make a loaf from the Baking & Pancake Mix, there is a recipe on the Pamela's web site - it's just not as nice as the Bread Mix loaf.<br /><br />Very disappointing."
I was given a track number and told it was delivered to my POBOX.  It never happened.  I received a refund and am now in the process of wating for my new reorder.
This arrived today. The packaging was sealed but after opening the package I found that the cheap plastic cover was totally off the Tamarind Paste and the seal was even broken. Obviously I won't be eating it.
"This sweetner is the best, it brings out the true flavors in what ever you add it to. And it has great health benefts."
"I have been GF for 2years.  I used this product for biscuits and liked them but were a little dry.  As for the pancakes, I prefer another product.  The pricing is outrageous.  I am single but cannot imagine trying to justify this cost when making pancakes for a family.  I love the Betty Crocker GF cake mixes and brownies though.  I still make my biscuits and oven baked chicken using this product.  It is getting more difficult to find on store shelves so most times I order here.  I have several BC cookbooks and have used the GF version Bisquick  as substitute for the regular Bisquick..  Some come out Ok while others are not too good.  I am learning to vary ingredients to achieve better results.  My best experiment with this product was my scratch cornbread.  I use GF corn meal and this mix to make a delicious bread.  thank you BC for this product.  Work on the pricing.  I would use it more often if I could afford it.  Tired of manufacturers holding GF people hostage because it seems to be the latest ""diet craze"".  GF people have to have these products to live.<br /><br />Going GF saved my life and BC now makes products so I can enjoy baked goods again.  I make my own breads using other products and now biscuits, cakes, cookies with this and other BC GF products.  I also use this product when recipes call for small amounts of regular flour.  It depends on what I am making.<br /><br />As I am reviewing the product I gave it 5 stars.  I give the pricing 2 stars."
"This is a real treat for coffee lovers - a little pricey, but worth it."
I have tried so many k cup coffees and products. Bought a k cup coffeemaker for mom & friend and myself but I have been dissapointed in the quality of the coffee until I got the Folgers. Taste like good Folgers coffee on the quick. A bit expensive but you have no wasted coffee.
"Rather Salty, but seems to taste and pop better than the Wabash Farms brand. I'm more than happy with it!"
"Originally, these were made in US. Now made in China ( see back of bag) ... advertised as natural,cage free, no hormones, no fillers, no antibiotics ...HUH? Not in China... I will not trust these as safe treats. Follow up:  My dogs vomited after they ate these. 3/09 original warnings from FDA 2007 re: chicken product from China... a follow up was issued by the FDA again on 12/18/08 to remain vigilant and of concern if fed to smaller dogs.<br /><br />Update: DEC 2011 All chicken Jerky remains a problem according to the FDA (product from China noted again to be of concern)<br />Some dogs made ill from chicken jerky product recovered with treatment and others have died.<br />The email from my vet stated that the FDA would like you to report if you have a problem with chicken jerky treats."
Very dissappointed to find out I only get 1 box of 24 KCups. Almost $1 a cup. I usually get 2 boxes for this price. CRAZY!!! I buy these online because they are much cheaper than stores. I did not receive the right flavor and shipping seemed to take very long. Not happy!!!
"This is my second time ordering the ""bulk"" amount, because these biscuits have no match, and they are hard to find in stores. Packaging was MUCH better this time -- bubble wrapped and double boxed. I'm giving a lower rating, though, because I received these in early August, and the expiration date is already up this December. So I feel I've been sent old merchandise. I would expect at least a year for a processed and packaged food item like this, especially ordered in this quantity. I don't know if Amazon will allow for a return or exchange.<br /><br />***Update***<br />Food items cannot be returned, but I was pleased to see that Amazon refunded my money! Now that's customer service."
"I first found these at our local ""mart"" store (you know which one) but they are often out of stock totally or only have one flavor.<br />This flavor, the apple cinnamon is good, but not my favorite. It's basically just applesauce with cinnamon like you can buy in the big jars, but this has no preservatives, colorings, additives, water dairy or gluten-nothing artificial...just apples and cinnamon, but the texture is much smoother than regular applesauce. It's not as smooth as baby food, but somewhere in the middle. It's extremely convenient for on the go, for kids *no spill and it has a cap!*, trips etc. They're a little spendy..in fact, more so here than at the local store, which is strange, but worth it to have the type you want, when you want it. I actually think my husband and I like it more than my 2nd grader! My personal favorite is the apple/strawberry flavor. I'm not a banana fan, so i haven't tried that flavor.<br />This brand also makes pure fruit bites, which are basically fruit snacks, but without added sugar, preservatives or anything but 100% fruit..and best of all in my opinion, NO GELATIN! They're very yummy, more so than sugary fruit snacks...they're a little tart which is nice. It's so great to have good snack food options, they're a great, fun way to get your daily fruits in. And, like the fruit pouches, they come in a resealable, ziplock type pouch which is also super convenient.<br /><br />All Natural<br />No preservatives<br />No added sugar<br />Soooo YUMMY!<br />..who could ask for anything more??"
"Ended up with a case of the Stephen's chocolate rasberry and a case of the Stephen's French Vanilla<br />""cocoa.""  I really wanted to believe the 100% positive feedback on here, but you should never believe<br />what you read, right?<br />I guess the 1st thing I look for in a cocoa is that the liquid has some body to it. This seemed just<br />watery and weak....it looks like a no-fat soymilk.<br /><br />It kind of makes me think of baby formula...........the other reviewer who said like a hot vanilla<br />milkshake is close to describing it but it is not creamy enough in my opinion to qualify as such.....<br /><br />I added MORE than the recommended amount for the serving size and it was still just so-so.<br /><br />I am just not impressed with the way the powder globbed together and<br />clumped and stuck to the spoon~yuk.<br />$5 a can for 12 serving when you can get the packets of the standard cocoa for 99 cents on sale for<br />the same amount of servings?<br />Granted, Amazon's price is better than the manufactures website since there is NO shipping through<br />here and shipping is at a premium through Stephen's Gourmet.<br />I would say unless you have tried this somehow elsewhere first, do not bother wasting your money to buy<br />6lbs of cocoa mix at one time. You might end up doing what I will have to do when you don't like it.<br />sigh<br />give it away~"
"I will admit that I like strong flavorful but not burnt tasting coffee. I give four stars to the Tully House Blend, but this Breakfast Blend is quite weak.<br />After ordering fifty of them, my husband and I in desperation have been trying to use them up by putting a kcup on espresso setting and using 2-3 kcups on Expresso  as needed to fill up our coffee cup. I'm sure it's a  fine Kcup if you like weak coffee, but..."
"I was actually a little surprised that this was as good as it was, because I've tried some of the other lower calorie peanut butters, like Better N Butter (I think that's what it was called) and I actually spit it out because it tasted so artificial. If you go to the Bell Plantation site, the company that makes this stuff, there are lots of recipes that look appetizing. My only problem with this powdered peanut butter is that it's just not as satisfying as the real stuff because there's no (or not much) fat in it . So sometimes it's hard to only eat a little like you would with normal peanut butter. But the taste is very natural, not fake tasting in any way, and I loved it!"
"I came across this searching for Paleo-friendly products on Amazon.  ""Canola"" oil is NOT Paleo.  Admittedly, the product does not specifically advertise as Paleo, but really, canola oil is very unhealthy.  Skip this and ask for Wilderness Family to re-stock their mayo."
"This was a nice mild Truffle oil. Usually pay more at Whole Foods or high end grocery store. This was a good quality and tastes great over potatoes and grilled vegetables. Quick Ship, happy with purchase."
"If you need a biscuit fix this is good, but costs too much (Should be 1/3 the price). A better way is to get the book 'Carb Wars: Sugar is the New Fat' (ISBN 0979201802) and use the cooked gluten flour secret to make your own for much less money. (The Popovers are great!)"
"DEfintely not as tasty as the Madhouse Munchies which are my family's favorite. Kettle's are dark/burnt,more broken bits, taste greasy-oily and not the light crunch. Oh well."
"Bought a bonsai for my daughter for christmas. When it arrived it was in one piece, packaged very well and when taken out of the box absolutely beautiful.  My daughter now wants a few more and when I get her another one I will definately order from Sheryl Shop again."
"I remember the old days of having shake and bake BBQ ( I had a mother that was raising 5 girls alone). Chicken and the S & B were cheap to buy in these days and we ate it a lot.<br /><br />I never thought those memories could be recreated through smell and taste again, but oh My godness it was!!<br />It is just a delicious as I remember it being as a kid. I bought a case of 8 and have 6 more left. I don't know why the stores don't have this in stock...one clerk said its the msg in it. Well people should be able to make there choices of buying it or not buying it.<br />I am still amazed at the granular style it is and how it ends up this red sticky delicious old style bbq sauce that sticks to it like glue.<br />It is so gooood!! I highly recommend buying it and it would probably be good on ribs too!!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E1HVW0"">Shake 'N Bake Seasoned Coating Mix, BBQ Glaze, 7-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)</a>"
"If you're looking at this product, it's probably because you're like me and the acid in regular coffee is enough to cause fiery backwash within minutes or hours of drinking it. This coffee solved that problem for me, short & simple. I am reviewing this for Amazon vine and I'm not afraid to be honest.<br /><br />The taste of the coffee is very much like a Starbucks decaffeinated Italian roast, but the smell is more like a Whole Foods Sumatran blend/roast. If there were any complaint, the lack of acidity does take away a little bit of the ""hit in the mouth"" that you normally expect from coffee.  That being said, it also worked well for making iced coffee.<br /><br />And-- no acid reflux! So in that, it is as advertised."
"I just called Bob's Red Mill customer service (just do a G search for the company, their customer service number is under ""contact us"" on their site), and I was annoyed to learn that NONE OF BOB'S RED MILL BAKING SODA CONTAINS ALUMINUM. I've been paying $10-15 (with shipping) for this magical 'aluminum free' baking soda only to learn that the Bob's Red Mill 'premium baking soda' at my local grocery is the same exact thing. Call for yourself if you don't believe me. Ugh."
"These are the most fantastic chips I've ever had!  I could eat the whole bag myself!  They're made with lots of whole grain and beans, and make a complete protein, so I have no qualms about feeding them to my kids as snacks.  They are great!  The only problem I have with them:  The bag is too small!!!  We need a bigger bag!! :)"
"Our Airedale Violet liked the idea at first. I sat on the floor with her and introduced her to the ins and outs of it. She just couldn't coordinate holding the jug in the correct position while jiggling the rope. She wound up frustrated, barking at the treats which she could clearly see... ""they're right there in the bleepin' jug"". She spent some time trying to figure out how to open the bottom of the jug. I guess she thought she had a better chance of getting the bottom unscrewed than getting the treats out by holding it at just the right angle with her paw while tugging on the rope. Sorry Vi"
Would be better if the smell of the liver wouldn't stick to the fingers. Also if trying to train multiple dogs you will need a lot of packages.
Keeps litter off the floor and is easily cleaned when compared to other type of mats.
"These are some of the tastiest GF crackers. My 6 year old daughter loves them. They also look the most like non-GF crackers, which helps my daughter feel a little less self conscious when she takes them to school. Amazon sells them for a great price. Thanks Amazon!"
"I tried these and wanted to like them, but just couldn't.  They did not seem to ""pop"" very well (a lot of wasted product in the bag) and they didn't taste very good.  I will not be buying these again."
"OK so pretzels are supposed to be salty, but these are a tad too salty.  They also have a burnt flavor.  You could say this is a distinctive smokey flavor, but 12 bags ahead of you with the prospects of an unsatisfied pallett is a mighty tall order.  On the other hand the subtle sweet flavors are good.  This is not your ordinary pretzel try them in safety first (instead of buying 12 bags).  Also note grocery items cannot be returned to Amazon!"
"van houtte chocolate raspberry truffle lack the rasberry taste, which was what I was shopping for."
"""Yeast Extract"" is listed as an ingredient. Sounds harmless, right? Specifically, these chips contain autolyzed yeast extract, which is, on a chemical level, monosodium glutamate. It's just derived from a different source, but it has all the same toxic properties. Kettle still advertises their products as containing ""No MSG"" while they acknowledge that their chips are not safe for people with MSG sensitivities."
after opening numerous bags I found that none of the chips had any flavoring on them. completely plain and gross. how does this even happen?
"Only one store in my area, Sprouts, sells wheatgrass in their produce section. Whole Foods sells it, but it is a goodly distance from my house so I only get wheatgrass from them once in a great while. I have a bunny who enjoys wheatgrass as a treat, so I go to Sprouts to get it for her, but wanted to grow my own since it is expensive and requires frequent shopping trips. So I bought these kits and decided to grow it myself. First I have to say I was impressed at how quickly they shipped my order. So I planted the seeds on Friday and by Sunday night, I had wheatgrass sprouts like crazy. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, and deliver abundant grass as promised.<br /><br />I have to say, though, that the grass doesn't look at all like the wheatgrass in stores. The blades are way taller (8 inches) and about twice the thickness of the wheatgrass I am used to buying for my bunny. I took pictures but discovered that my camera's memory card doesn't fit this new computer, so I can't show prospective buyers a picture of it. Rats. Since bunnies have sensitive digestive systems and you have to be careful what you feed them, I don't feel safe feeding this grass to her. I can't return it because I aready cracked open the kit and grew grass from one of the three seed kits. The grass is probably fne, but as a bunny owner, I want other bunny owners to know that this grass isn't like the wheatgrass in stores, jut so they aren't surprised and disappointed like I was."
"I recommend this instead for the same price: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HD0PEQ"">Swiss Miss Hot Cocoa Mix, Milk Chocolate, 16-Count Envelopes (Pack of 8)</a><br /><br />This thing falls short, I found myself adding some milk or my non-dairy creamers to my cup of this to make it taste somewhat creamy.  It more or less tastes horrible otherwise.  After I hated it, I decided to make it with a cup of hot milk, I just decided to pour it into a hot cup of milk, and it tastes so much better.  In my opinion, they need to up the powdered milk in them, or the non-dairy creamer in them.  It would improve this product so greatly.<br /><br />They are thieves nonetheless, you usually get 10 envelopes of hot cocoa that tastes better than this in the supermarket for less than five bucks, buy two for less than ten, and still be spending less than what I spent with these.  I really thought I was buying quality, this is definitely not unless I use milk which is like cheating myself and spending extra money.  I've drank common hot cocoa from supermarket straight with water that tasted way better than this.<br /><br />AVOID!"
"For some reason my husband ordered a TON of this stuff for me for Christmas.  We live in Chicago & it's cold so I didn't try it right away.  I was craving something sweet so I finally made some tonight.  It tastes like icy chocolate, & it's a bit chalky.  To be honest it reminds me of the old powdered slimfast.  I've got a whole canister and 5 packets of this stuff & I don't know what I'm going to do with it."
"This is our favorite K-cup at home. Mellow and flavorful.<br /><br />Also, I wanted to clear-up the question of whether or not this is decaf - it is not. See the response I received from WP Coffee:<br /><br />""Is Breakfast in Bed K-cup actually a decaf coffee?""<br /><br />""Thanks for reaching out to Wolfgang Puck Coffee. The Breakfast in Bed is not a decaf blend....""<br /><br />Thanks.<br />Mandy M<br />Customer Service<br />Wolfgang Puck Coffee"
"No odor, works well, good price.  Very pleased and will buy again in the future for our grooming shop."
"The ad plainly says 16oz can ""pack of 3"". I ordered ""2"", so that should have been 6 cans...... I only received two! I have thought about calling the Better Business Bureau and complaining. It's a matter of principle!  It is a good mix, but I won't be ordering from them again."
My little guy loves to try new foods..so this variety pack is great.<br /><br />Feeding organic is the way to go. We trust and love the earths best brand<br />Ther formula is great. Amazon.com seems to have the best price around i checked.<br /><br />It is great to get the auto ships of babyfood..less trips to the store for dad !
"I love this coffee. Rejuvenates me before a workout. It's a little strong the first time that you try it, but after awhile, I couldn't imagine a better coffee to start my day. I strongly recommend it."
"I agree with one of the previous posts - coffee is a matter of personal taste. My wife and I really liked this coffee, it was fresh and flavorful. If you like dark roasts, don't buy this one, it is definitely not dark. The flavor is very distinct and pleasant, as opposed to some Kuna and Blue Mountain blends we have tried before."
"On top of the delightful aspartame, this comes complete with hydrogenated oils and is a dead ringer for Country Time Lemonade mix."
I have a english bull terrier with ALOT of skin problems so he takes medication and vitamins 2x per day and some of them are quite big and the zinc pills apparently taste extra bad so he has become very difficult to give pills and actually hides with he hears the bottles being opened and when you get him you have to pry his very large jaw open and hold it closed until he swallows because he'll spit it out. With pill pockets I even combine a few together and he LOVES it... he will even do his tricks to take his meds now and I'm not sure he even chews ha.. Its a little expensive but combining the pills together makes it last longer and it saves time and my fingers!
"You'd be surprised how much Runa Tea can help you in your daily life. Thirsty or not, Hot or cold, this tea can help you in many ways. As a college student studying to be an entrepreneur, I can't just take prescribed drugs all the time to keep my attention span up. Instead, I turn to caffeine all day every day. Runa Tea has been one of the few products that have really caused me to feel refreshed as if I was just hydrated after a run, as well as feeling focused as if I were ready to write a 10 page paper from scratch. I don't know what it is, but it just makes you feel good in every way. Personally, I love the cold tea- but as a consumer everyone needs to find their niche, as I am a huge hot tea drinker and chose the cold version- Either way, same thing.  You need to try it. And then try and contradict our 5 star opinions! :)"
"Just an FYI that ""Yeast Extract"" is one of the titles that MSG hides behind. MSG IS a preservative and a dangerous one at that. The package lies... these contain preservatives. I will not be eating these!"
"I'm sure this flavor isn't for everyone, but if you enjoy your coffee on the sweeter and more flavorful side then you should enjoy this. It is not what I would call a ""strong"" coffee by any means. I would describe it as mild and flavorful."
I have eaten Kopali Organic Mangos from grocery stores like Whole Foods before and they were excellent. The ones I received were horrible. I had different members of my family try them and they felt the same way. Then when I tried to return the remaining packages Amazon could not find my account and by the time it was straighten out it was too late to return them. I will not be purchasing food items from Amazon again.
"The first time i had these I got them at ""Jacks"" In NYC for .99c a pack. I loved them. Have been dreaming of them. I got the bright idea to look for them on Amazon. Glad I did. Payed slightly more with the auto ship but worth every penny since I live in PA and the gas to get to the city is more then the case price. I like to toast them in the toaster oven for a few minutes. The flavor is very good. Very few off flavored nuts. I have had better luck with these then with the fresh."
"This stuff is pretty disgusting.  I don't care if Madonna, Tom Cruise or whatever celebrity invested in the company and carries a container of it around for photo opps, it tastes bad.  And as far as rehydrating better than water, umm, don't think so.  It might replenish potassium, although, unless you are participating in the Olympics, you probably are not going to risk a potassium deficiency from physical activity."
"this product is the best in usa , We bought this for our grown-up snow cones. Absolutely yummy. Pour spouts are easy to use Flavours are delicious"
a little too salty for me but tasty.  I hope my taste buds aren't just acting up.  They were a large portion though.  That surprised me.
"My dog used to LOVE these.  I thought I was was giving him a great ""treat"", that was actually a supplement to improve his arthritis symptoms.  Then, his liver enzymes were elevated, and he was becoming less active, and always thirsty.  Thank goodness a friend sent me a link about the FDA warnings, 2-3 since, 2009!<br />Hundreds of dogs have died,very painful and expensive deaths.  If you love your dog-go to the FDA  website yourself...and Do Not BUY these ""treats""!"
"I thought that I should post a review in response to bad cat.  We ordered off the same batch for the same holiday reasons and had no illl effects.  The coffee was great.  There was no tart aftertaste no matter how strong you brew it.  The only reason that I gave it only four stars is that I would personally of liked a litter darker roast.  I just wanted to say that we drank off the same lot as bad cat, in the same year, Christmas Eve and Christmas, with zero headaches or ill tidings.  It just might have been something else."
It's a great toy and at first she was hesitant but now she is SO fast.. if your dog is treat intrigued this is a perfect gift to buy. Now I need to find something that will keep her busy longer! She wags her tail and is a pro...great brain teaser for any dog!!
"Amazon seems to have combined the reviews for three different products here, Italian, French, and Columbian. I picked up a box of the Italian Roast at the grocery, and I really like it. It is strong and full flavored without bitterness. For hot coffee, I make the larger size cup, and the smaller for iced coffee. I checked Amazon to see if I could save money, but it looks like the same price I paid at the store ($9.99 for a box of 12)."
Bought these based on the review and the type of treat. My Peagle puppy loves these more than cheese! Perfect for training and they can be cut up easily so you don't overfeed. Great price compared to other treats of the same quality. Highly recommended.
"I'm recently widowed so have to learn to fix for a single person. I hoped this microwaveable bowl of ""Beefaroni"" would provide a tasty lunch. To my surprise, I found that it was nearly all macaroni, with some tomato sauce and a very small amount of beef. The taste was OK if you like macaroni and a rather strong tomato sauce, but I expected more beef. Also, as with so many canned food these days, be prepared for a high dose of sodium -- salt, that is -- 31% of average daily requirement in one small serving. Overall, no so good."
"I purchased these to give to children who come to my place of business.  When they arrived, it says clearly on the back of the individual wrapper ""MADE IN CHINA.""  NO WAY I'm giving these to children if they were manufactured in China, following the whole poisoned pet food debacle.  The fact that these are made in China needs to be highlighted much more clearly."
"I have been eating the 100 Calorie Chip Ahoy for sometime. I really find that it is a filling, guilt-free snack. It has a unique taste of its own - not a `diet' food-type taste either, it taste like a `real' snack."
"I used to love Quaker oatmeal, they they went and changed the recipe, now is tastes like paste with uncooked oatmeal chunks in it.  I tried adding more sugar to it, but it doesn't help.  Don't belive they hype when they say it ""tastes great"".  i would pay to have a box of the classic stuff back."
"I received my tree quite quickly despite the holidays. when I got the tree, it was packaged very well and i don't think anything short of getting run over by a freight train could have broken the tree. I called after I got the tree and the exchange i had with the person on the other end was very helpful, and I could not be more pleased with their service. these guys show great care and dedication to the customers.<br /><br />All in all, a fantastic buy."
"this gum is the worst i have ever purchased, plain and simple. within two seconds of chewing taste gone!"
I first tasted this wonderful black tea six years ago in Ireland and was amazed.  No tea can compare with the rich flavor.  Since then I have bought Barry's Gold Blend tea through a coffee importer--it is the only tea I drink.  Now I see that it is available on Amazon--fabulous!
"Made in China, does anything else need to be said?<br /><br />I used to buy them then noticed the label, I will not buy again."
"I kind of expected something that would taste nothing like peanut butter. Not only does this stuff taste like regular peanut butter, it has the same consistency once you mix it. It has a taste similar to a low quality peanut butter or a high end less sugar healthy kind. Peanut butter has always been my weakness and I am so excited to have an alternative that wont kill my daily diet. It's even good enough to eat by itself without and kind of cracker etc. . .<br />The only down side, why I gave it 4 stars, is the price. It is much more expensive than regular peanut butter, but considering the trade off with so many fewer calories, I consider it worth it."
It has been a long time since I had used Shake and Bake..I wasn't even sure it still existed.  However I reall enjoyed this sample...it gave a really good flavor to pork steak and I have enough left for several pork shops..very good and healthier than frying. Glad to see it is available at Amazon.
I love snacks and Grandpa Po's Originals are a great snack to satisfy a hunger craving. They are crunchy and have great flavor. It's hard to stop eating the whole bag in one sitting!
"I thought an acid-reduction was a great idea, yet  the taste just isn't there. Tasted & smelled bitter, flat & slightly weak.<br /><br />Doesn't taste like any French roast I've ever had. Needs more work in the taste area.<br /><br />Comes in a single-use foil pouch for coffee maker or French press.<br /><br />The science may be there & it didn't bother my stomach, but it didn't taste the best either.<br /><br />I'd rather get a great coffee & take an antacid with it to get the great taste. I'm not much of a coffee drinker, but like a nice cup of great coffee every once in a while.<br /><br />Might be OK for every-day coffee drinkers that buy regular, bulk coffee brands, but not for me."
"Definately not what I'd expected with the Wolfgang Puck name on it.  To me, Wolfgang Puck has conotations of a heavy, dark-roast European-style coffee.  I thought I'd already found my perfect coffee in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D0GV68"">Timothy's World Coffee, Breakfast Blend for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a> but this one edges it out.  Smooth and balanced it really is great from the first sip till the last drop.<br /><br />There will never be a coffee that all coffee lovers will agree on but if you like a light-medium roast, give the Breakfast in Bed blend a try.  Very low in acidity, someone who can't tolerate the acidity in coffee may be able to enjoy this blend.  But, be aware and contrary to popular belief, light roast coffee is typically higher in caffine than the dark roast coffees, the extended roasting to produce a dark roast burns away some of the caffine. This one will definately get you going in the morning in a good way.<br /><br />Those who prefer a dark roast or extra bold should probably look elsewhere."
"It saddens me to say I had to return this item.  The item's page specifically said the Calamares were packed in Olive Oil.  However on the actual boxes the ingrediant showed it was packed in another oil....an unhealthy oil.  That was the bad news.  The good news is Amazon, as usual, was gracious and professional in allowing me to return this item which is considered to be 'not returnable'.  That is why I buy everything online from Amazon.com.  They are the best."
I think we bought about 8 bags of this Merrick Whole Earth Farms adult dry dog food and so far the first bag is working out well.  We have a few dogs and we usually get a couple of 35-40 lb bags but it is hard to store but this 8 lb bags are convenient and easier to store if you like to stock up.  The ingredients are good and our dogs seem to like the food and they have not had any digestive issues.  Will probably buy this again in the future.
Love All THE FLAVORS!!!!! JUST THE RIGHT SIZE PACKAGE AND TASTE GREAT!!!!! GIVE THEM A TRY YOU WILL LOVE THEM ALSO!!!!!
"I love Keurig coffee.  I can't always get the flavors I want in the store, so I shop Amazon.com.  The coffee is always fresh.  I am going to order more as soon as I finish this review.  You can always count on Keurig and Amazon."
"Hazelnut coffee is the best coffee I have ever had,  I find myself drinking 2-3 cups a day exceeding my ususal 1 cup with breakfast.  I have tried other brands and like Timothy's also, but this brand is slightly less expensive.  I will continue to purchase it."
"Bought 1/2 lb each of five different Mo's Fudge recently from a school fundraiser. I'm not much of a chocolate fudge eater, prefer peanut butter, but the dark chocolate fudge is incredible. So rich and creamy! Almost too creamy. Had to throw it into the fridge to make it easier to cut. But if any fudge can turn me into a chocolate fudge lover, this can!"
"I've tried many different low-carb pastas over the last 14 years. They all tasted like cardboard, didn't smell like pasta and disintegrated into grainy, pasty substance if even slightly overcooked (not that the texture was ever pasta-like to begin with). When I ordered the Carba-Nada, the most I had really hoped for was ""edible"" or that whatever funky grassy or cardboard-like flavors it might have could be masked with a bold sauce. The first surprise was that it smelled exactly like regular hard semolina pasta while boiling (I really love that smell!) I like my pasta al dente and this was most definitely al dente and sturdy like a good pasta should be. I ate a few strands right out of the pot with nothing on them and was surprised at how much I liked it. Bonus: With all that extra protein and fiber in it, I was more stuffed eating what's considered 2 servings (4 dry ounces, like ""regular"" pasta) than I've ever been with the same amount of ""regular"" pasta but the Carba-Nada has fewer calories. I saved even more calories because I didn't need to add a protein to my dinner. There's already plenty of protein in the Carba-Nada pasta itself. The best basic pantry item I've found in years."
"Newman's Own Organics - New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats, Lamb and Barley Recipe, are a hit with my dog. I own a Shar Pei/Beagle mix with an extremely finicky appetite. She is very hard to buy treats for, as she turns her nose up to most dry, larger treats. I had my misgivings about this product, as the treats are larger than I expected, two cookie-like squares attached to each other. There is also no powerful or distinct smell of her usual favorite treats, peanut butter or cheese. Yet, every time I give one to her it disappears in seconds! I'll definitely be buying more of these.<br /><br />I'm also grateful for the healthier ingredients: organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic apples, organic palm oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols, a source of Vitamin E), and organic molasses."
This toy is perfect for my Min Pin.  He works at getting his kibble out of it for a good 30 minutes.
"I am on a highly salt restricted diet (and potassium too.) I have End Stage Renal Failure, or kidney failure, so on dialysis. Also diabetic so my overall diet is extremely restricted. This is the first 'salt' substitute that acctually has a salty taste. Most others use potassium which is a poor substitute, or various herbs and spices to make up for the missing salt. They add flavors to be sure, but still no salt-like kick of flavor enhancement. It's too bad Amazon doesn't also sell the 1 pound package, that has to be obtained from the small manufacturer, which right now is extremely backlogged. Took me 4 months to get my direct order of the 1 pound package, but a great price saving for everyday use. If it is hard giving up salt, try Table Tasty, I think you will like it."
"My beagle/lab mix is fairly picky with treats, but she goes nuts for these. I've been trying to find something other than chicken jerky from China (after reading reports from the FDA showing illness/death in dogs) that my dog really loves, and these seem to fit the bill nicely."
"Very bitter!  I couldn't taste the coffee at all.  It basically tastes like baking cocoa.  No sweetness, no richness, not coffee.  I bought the 4 pack though, so I've begun mixing it half and half with Swiss Miss (in the can), and then sprinkling it with instant coffee after I've made a cup.  Even making it with whole milk couldn't make this yummy by itself.  If you like a rich chocolate taste with just a bit of coffee.... shop elsewhere."
"My favorite candy by far.  Just the right amount of chocolate and peanut.  I can eat a whole bag by myself.  And no, not the small package, the COSTCO sized ones!!  Yep I'm a huge fan :)"
"I've been using this tea for for about 6 months and drink it as iced tea daily.<br /><br />I microwave my water on high in a pyrex 2 cup glass container for 2 minutes on high and then pop the little white mesh bags in for about 5 - 15 minutes. I use about 3 - 4 bags for a rich taste and since I'm going to be pouring it over ice. I put my ice cubes in a large glass and pour my hot tea over the ice, grab a straw and it's ready to drink.<br /><br />It also tastes good when I steep 2 bags of the Revolution White Pomegranate Tea with 2 bags of the Arizona Pomegranate. This is my favorite on ice. The Arizona is a green tea. Anyhow, this is my usual lunchtime pick me upper. I want to note that I gave up drinking diet soda in March and has made this concoction my replacement. It was a little difficult at first, but now that awful stuff is out of my system.<br /><br />I have not tried this tea hot, as I am not a fan of hot tea, but I'm sure it's just as delicious. I subscribe to this and the Arizona Pomegranate Green Tea."
I took a chance seeing the variation experienced by others.  The shipment that we received has such a minimal taste of cinnamon that I wouldn't say they're cinnamon if given a sample.  We opened each of the packs to see if any were a strong cinnamon taste but no luck.  I definitely won't reorder these.
"I purchased the High Protein Pretzels.  I've had Newman's Own Organic Pretzels before and they tasted great - but these are not good at all.  95% of the salt is at the bottom of the bag (have to have salt on pretzels!) and they have an overwhelming flavor of being burnt and not a good burnt either!  I have no use now for all these pretzels and i can't imagine anyone enjoying this taste!<br />It is upsetting to see that a few others also ended up with the High Protein pretzels having this awful BURNT flavor and yet they still kept sending them out.  I'd think maybe they'd look at batch numbers or something to prevent them from being shipped out to dissatisfied customers who will give it a bad review.<br />Generally Newman's Pretzels are really good, but buy these at your own risk...."
"I get around a shipment a week all year round from Amazon, and I can not remember ever writing a review. But I am making a point of expressing my anger over this product. I buy lots of tea from many sources and white peony is one of my favorites. The package says it is organic and of the finest quality. It was possibly the worst tea I have ever tasted. In fact, after a couple of pots, I actually threw nearly the whole half pound in the trash. And the price wasn't even that good. I subsequently bought a pound of excellent organic white peony from Whole Foods for less. Whatever they are, this is not a tea company."
"Flavor may be something that has to be given up with low acid coffee, but I decided I'd rather take massive doses of Pepcid and drink regular coffee than subject my tongue to this awful swill."
good products and fast shipping equals a happy me. a little pricey but you can hand pick a few good flavors...a few i cant find anywhere else so def worth the price
"Slightly biased because this company was started near my hometown, but I've been a fan of Erin Baker's Breakfast Cookies for years since I first noticed them popping up at coffee shops back home.  Now living on the other side of the country I was pleasantly surprised to find them on Amazon, and even more excited to find them at such a great price!  Store them in the freezer, pop them in the toaster and it's like eating a fresh baked cookie that is full of good things for you and keeps you from getting hungry till lunch.  High in fiber and much better tasting than any energy bar out there, who doesn't love a cookie for breakfast?  I love these things, will be ordering more soon to keep our freezer well stocked!"
"Coffee was good but every cup broke during use, making a mess inside the cup and out, will not purchase again."
"I've tried several of the Blue Diamond jar almonds and the Butter Toffee almonds are the best.  They would probably be my favorite almond, but they're high-carb. I guess the trick is to only eat a few at a time....  We can all do that, right?  :-)<br /><br />I agree with the other reviewer who said that the Blue Diamond almonds in the cans are better than the ones in the jars -- my favorite are the Vinegar & Salt -- but the Butter Toffee almonds are the exception."
My dogs had been eating canidae since they stopped eating their puppy food. They did great on it until yesterday we bought a new bag and they became violently ill after only eating one bowl. This was the only variant in their diet.<br />I returned the bag back to the pet store and found out they had changed their formula because ingredients had become more expensive. They did not even notify consumers!<br />My dogs have very sensitive stomachs. What they may consider a simple change made them very sick. This is a complete disregard for the dogs they supposedly care for. I understand they need to make money but notify the consumer so they can make an educated decision or buy the old formula at a higher price.
"I have purchased many different flavors of the Coffee Masters ground coffee.  They are the best I have ever found.  Also discovered that they make a really awesome iced coffee on a hot day.  I just make a pot, let it cool and put it in the fridge.  Just throw some ice in a glass and add sugar and cream to taste.  Everyone has a favorite flavor and that is just a matter of personal preference."
"I was expecting great things based on the reviews. While it IS good, it's not great. I believe my waffles made from Bisquick were just as tasty as these, and this costs quite a bit more. The instructions ARE very easy to follow though, and I DO like the canister for storage."
"I bought these cookies as Easter gifts for two different family members and both RAVED about the clor, shape and flavor of these organiz cookies. They're sure to please everyone!"
"This product is so dry it can cut a Cat's mouth, cause bleeding and choking. The product I received from Petco was dry as a Bone. It could be compared to eating a Fish without debonning it first. You wouldn't feed your Family Fish Bones. My cats are my Family.<br /><br />Maybe te product I received was no the usual quality, but it was dry, dry dry. Both the Salmon and Whiting were equally dry."
"The Brownie Mix is a great base for cheesecake, creamcheese, cool whip stuff, etc. The brownies are great, the whole family loves them, not just those who need a gluten-free diet.  MAKES A GREAT GIFT!!!!!"
"okay, it's freeze-dried liver cube-lets.  my common sense tells me that for a lot less than the price of this treat i could buy real liver, cube it and freeze it.  it would serve the same purpose for a lot less money, and it would not be over-processed.<br />that said, our dog would do back flips for this treat, so if you're made of money, go ahead.  you'll make your dog's day  :-)"
"I really like these crackers. They have a mild good flavor, very crisp and crunchy. Lots of good fiber. I very rarely use bread anymore. I just put whatever I was going to put in the sandwich on the cracker. Yum,Yum, and Crunch, Crunch. Bacon and egg on a cracker?? Mayonnaise and sliced tomato on a cracker?? Try it, you'll like it."
"WOW!  I didn't expect that this would work last night, but it did!  I had the worst case of heartburn at 10 weeks along, and after not being able to eat dinner and 4 tums, it wasn't getting any better.  My best friend just bought me the Earth Mama Angel Baby tea sampler the other day and I had a lightbulb moment, remembering the heartburn tea was in there.  I figured it was worth a shot, not having eaten dinner and feeling nauseous and miserable.  Within a half an hour, the tea helped me to let out a couple of good burps and the hearburn finally eased.  I'm not usually so excited about something to go out and write a review, but am hoping this might help some other mamas 2 be in need as well.  I am putting in an order to get some more of this today.  Will be good to have a box on hand at home and at work.  The taste is very nice too, so I am beyond pleased!"
"A number of us earnestly tried this product but after trying another brand, found this to be wanting very much.<br /><br />  With that said, there is a company making soy jerky that has better flavor, texture and quality. They even make jerky that is unsweetened. Most importantly, this company tasty eats does not have any garlic or onion powder in any of their products.<br /><br />  This was the biggest, we felt, downfall of this product. Except this company, every jerky company; except tasty eats which uses no garlic or onion powder in any of their product line, all would list garlic or onion if an ingredient. The primal strips company has ""vegetarian spices"" so one is not clear what this is. Even the company, after phoning them, are rather reticent about saying if their is granulated garlic or onion. But there is. In these primals strips, all are having some form of garlic, possibly onion.<br /><br />  We found tasty eats soy jerky to be Perfect. Really, in quality, texture and also the fact that they use no onion or garlic whatsoever."
I love these chips they are the best chips at a low price to pay because they are baked.Only 3 points for weight watchers member's for 1ounce which is about 20 chips and there are 3ounces in this bag.
"this product is grainy and smells very strong. my son didn't care for it and when i tried it i didn't either. when i did further research on this product i was disappointed to learn that they use a process that involves hexane to separate the oil used in their ""barrel drying""."
"These candies are great if they are NOT expired. I have ordered these candies from several different sellers on multiple occasions and I have consistently received expired products. Additionally, some sellers put company stickers over top of the expiration date so you can't tell when the product expires. Beware of the following sellers as I have had trouble with each of them: Toys Samurai, ABCTOY4me and ToysDiva. I have reported each of them to Amazon (4 different complaints in the past 4 months) and Amazon has done nothing to stop them from sending out expired products or products with hidden expiration dates. Good luck."
You can't make a better cup of regular coffee flavored coffee than this at home. I had been trying in every way imaginable for nearly forty years to make that 'perfect cup'. My patience has paid finally paid off.
"These chips are good. Knowing that they're not as bad for you will make you eat more of them - very dangerous. Most of the time, the chips tasted quite good, but every now and then I'd get one with this somewhat bitter aftertaste that wasn't very pleasant. Besides that, I would definitely buy these again."
"Although I'm a little embarrassed touting something so processed (maybe it's a reaction to a childhood eating peanut butter my parents hand-ground at their local health food store) I have to say I really like this stuff.  It is also the only peanut butter my 10 year old daughter will eat (can't get any other brands past her).  The reduced fat aspect of it may not save calories but it gives the product a slightly sweet taste, and for some reason only the Skippy brand maintains its smooth texture--every other brand I've tried gets tough or grainy patches in it.  This product is getting harder to find in supermarkets (and when I do find it it's at a premium price), so the availability on Amazon is great."
This IS the bread you've been looking for;  If you're gluten sensitive then look no further!
"I really liked the tatste of this.  It actually tastes like you're getting the juice from a tangerine...I think the carbonation gives it that zing taste you can only get biting into an tangerine, orange, etc.<br />My daughter, however, really didn't like it.  Not sweet enough for her.<br />I think it's a little pricey, not sure I'd be willing to plunk down that much for it~~the can is very small, 8.3 fl. ozs., which is a proper serving of orange juice, which makes it around $1 a can, or a little less.<br />But overall I truly enjoyed that zinging tangerine taste!!"
"If You have a Keurig and love good coffee, This is a product You will like. Easy single servings of delicious Folgers coffee from Amazon."
Tossed this out after trying it.  Texture and taste were far below expectations.  Seemed kind of mushy and pasty.  Pricy to boot.
"I thought I would go back to my grandparents heritage,all four born in Ireland, and try some Irish Tea.  I recently had a heart problem and my cardiologist recommended that I significantly decreae my caffeine intake.  I used to drink several glasses of iced tea every day. Strangely enough tea has at least as much caffeine as coffee.  Green tea is definately out as an alternative to coffee or other beverages; but black tea is fine.I picked up some store brand black tea bags (Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Chai)to make iced tea and I was quite pleased with the heartiness of the flavor.  I then researched the matter further and came accross the Taylor's Decaffeinated Irish Breakfast Tea.  I was quite disappointed with the results.  I like strong tea, and must use at least 14 tea bags to get the same results as 10 tea bags of the store brand.  As you might guess the store brand ia a lot less expensive.  I will use up the 6 boxes that conisted of my order, and then buy the store brand again."
"Tastes great, very yummy.  Will order again.  Healthy for you too.  No artificial anything."
"Love this mix for pancakes!<br />Many GF products have other ingredients I'm allergic to, so finding something that tastes great and is convenient is pretty exciting. I make a batch of pancakes and freeze individual servings to microwave later.<br />Just had the yummy Cheeseburger pie for dinner last night, recipes can be found on Bettycrocker.com."
"When it became difficult to find this product in our local grocery stores, I panicked until I found it on Amazon.  This has a MUCH better flavor than any other canned chickens I've tried.  For years it has been a major staple in my kitchen & desk drawer.  For a quick, guilt-free snack, it's tasty just smashed up in its own broth.  Mixed with some relish & either mayo or ranch dressing, it makes a delicious salad to eat alone, in a sandwich, or on crackers.  My elderly/feeble parents loved it microwaved with various tuna helper flavors as an easy main dish.  This is great in all of my favorite cooked chicken recipes, & it's always in the pantry, ready to use on short notice, but keeping just fine (unlike refrigerated alternatives) until it's needed.  When I can't incorporate the broth into whatever I'm making, I usually drink it, because it's too flavorful to waste."
"We use this flour for pancakes, muffins, biscuits and more.  I have found that this mix works great in all my old regular bisquick recipes.  We find the flavor to be similar to wheat flour.  We have subbed this flour into several wheat flour cookie recipes, leaving out the leavening called for, and only one has turned out unsatisfactorily, but not inedible.  Definitely convenient and more affordable to our family of seven to be able to purchase in bulk."
"This food is organic, sure.  However, look at the ingredients, top 7 includes chicken meal.  Never feed your pet anything with chicken meal or chicken by product.  It's a cheap substitute, and really is bad for the dog.  I suggest a brand like Evo, Blue Buffalo, ect.  No ingredient should be meal or by product."
"I bought a Bigelow ""sampler"" type box of decaffeinated teas, and fell in love with this French Vanilla Tea. I couldn't find a box of just this flavor in any local stores, so was delighted to be able to order it from Amazon. It's just wonderful tea; I love it! I think you will, too, if you like French Vanilla flavored coffees etc."
"Yummy!  Great ""everyday"" coffee.  Newman products in general are wonderful for you and the earth.  This k-cup and Jet Fuel k-cups are enough for me!"
This is for sure not what I was expecting it to taste like. It's not bad but not for me. I like the carbonation and juice idea with no added sugar. When I first took a sip of it I noticed it has a bite to it. The best way I can describe it is a non alcoholic champagne. I however did like it better than the watermelon but still not for me.
"this was a nice flavor,as I do enjoy french roast coffee.  it seemed a bit bitter to me, though.  I am not sure if that is because I have been drinking coffee from a keurig single brew for a while, and a ""pot"" of coffee tastes different after sittting a while?<br /><br />I would have to say that the low acid was a plus.  I didn't get the upset stomach that I would have after 4 cups of other coffee.  My only request is make this in kcup form, please :)<br /><br />so, all in all, it does what it says it'll do, it's low acid, doesn't bother your stomach, and does have a nice flavor.  the foil packaging would be great at keeping out heat and light and keeping the flavor in.<br /><br />if you need a low acid coffee for whatever reason, this would be a good buy at the price."
"Let me start by saying that I have purchased Popchips for several years. I was even on Amazon autoship for 2 boxes every 2 months because we enjoyed them so much. That being said, I have been very disappointed with the last 2 shipments received. The barbeque had little to no seasoning on both boxes of both shipments. Not to.mention that the bags are now half filled with air. The bad thing about this is that both shipments came from different plants. I was so dissapointed with this last batch that I attempted to return them, but Amazon does not accept food returns. I have canceled both autoships and I won't buy them again until I am assured that this problem has been corrected. LISTEN UP POPCHIPS: YOUR LOYAL CUSTOMERS WANT THE PRODUCT THAT WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO CONSUMMING. IF I WANTED ORIGINAL FLAVOR CHIPS I WOULD HAVE ORDERED THEM. I WANT MY BARBEQUE CHIPS TO TASTE LIKE BARBEQUE. YOU HAVE LOST A VERY LOYAL CUSTOMER WITH YOUR COST CUTTING EFFORTS :("
"I have been very interested in Starbucks Via instant coffee line, and it made me take a new look at Taster's Choice. I was pleasantly surprised by the good taste.<br /><br />I am a coffee fan that is often on the go, and I am going to use Taster's Choice to keep in my briefcase and car.<br /><br />Give it a try, and you'll enjoy Taster's Choice. Via costs $10 for 12 servings with only a slightly better taste. I would rather pay a tenth of the price and have the convenient tubes of Taster's Choice.<br /><br />Frugal is in and so are Taster's Choice Single Sticks."
"We have a new hot beverage cooker. This thing is the closest thing to the futuristic ""replicators"", made know via Star Trek movies and series of various efforts.<br /><br />We love our hot beverage brewer and have added a higher-end unit to our own home environment.<br /><br />We've used such a device and various coffee and tea pods over the last few years, but this kit tops that experience.<br /><br />I especially like the Hot-Chocolate and Tea beverages apart from the hundreds of coffee options.<br /><br />Do consider buying one of their devices and also sample the so very many flavors of coffees, teas and other hot beverages attached to the brewing station."
"The nuts arrived very quickly (with reg. $5 shipping). They came adequately packaged in 5lb thick, clear double-plastic bags. There's no oily residue left on my fingers after handling these nuts, thus I say they're dry-roasted or well toasted, actually too well for my taste, as some have pronounced ""burned"" taste to them. Since there're very similar cashew offerings here on Amazon that state ""roasted"", I was naively wishing for these to be UN-roasted. Still, these are much less expensive & less burned than those in grocery stores & not covered in sugar, salt, oil etc..."
"However the first thing to note about these is your going to be hammered with a strong garlic/onion after taste. And your significant other will remind you of this the next day. lol...But not hydro oils or fructose corn syrup or other stuff that should no longer be in any of our snacks are NOT in these. I have replaced the regular potato chips,""even the baked ones"" with these. I think they're better. Going to try the sea salted vinegar ones as well as the plains. Will report following. (Id give these a 4.5 if I could)<br /> ***One other thing to note;if you have soft skin in your mouth these may scratch it up."
"Shake and Bake is a popular coating and has been loved for years.  This packet is the same, and provides a crunchy and flavorful coating for the pork chops.  I generally use boneless, but have tried this on think boned pork chops also.<br /><br />I like the taste, and I feel the crunchy coating keeps the flavor in.  For leftovers, this makes a quick run and go snack.<br /><br />Tasty!  .....Rizzo"
"We live out of the country and if you can believe it... there are NO STARBUCKS anywhere near us.  When friends come to visit us, we ask them to bring us a supply of VIA Ready Brews.  It's almost as good as the freshly brewed.  It has a great aroma and big taste.  We love it!"
"I bought this because of all the great reviews, but unfortunately neither one of my two dogs were at all interested."
"Something is not right. Tastes very old. Stale. Weak. Weak at 8 ounces. Weak at 6 ounces. Strength OK at 4 ounces but tastes horrible. Not only will I not buy this coffee again, I won't buy Green Mountain coffee again. Very bad."
"If these brownies are gluten free, than I shall forever eat gluten free!  They are better than brownies containing gluten.  I have made them for parties and everyone always raves over them.  I even have had some family members act concerned that I would let my kids eat these brownies since they are suppose to eat only gf foods...little did they know the brownies are gf!  My skeptical friends and relatives who love to make fun of my different recipes (they don't really get it) cannot believe these brownies are gluten free.  THE best - the simplest terms in which to describe them!"
"My cousin was delighted with this gift, was the best gift I could have bought, the only downside is that if you do not get the price, I had no option to remove the price."
"I remember well the ""Beer Nuts"" I used to savor. Those were the days of the big 'Redskin' type peanut surrounded with a glaze of honey sweetness punctuated with a salty tang I remember so well. These nuts I now have in the palm of my hand are not reminiscent of ""Beer Nuts"" in any way. Yes, there is a discernible salty taste but the sweetness is more to me imagined than real. Plus, these nuts are simply the common inexpensive 'Spanish peanuts'. In short, I would just ask ""Beer Nuts"" ... 'What happened?'"
"This is a very tasty and refreshing little drink.  One of the best orange drinks you will find anywhere.  I only wish it were bigger, because it's that good."
"I consider my Sheltie to be an intelligent dog, but the noise of the toy makes him back away. And I can't tell you how many times I've ""demonstrated"" how to get the kibble out. He just waits until I do it. He could care less about the thing, and he's very food motivated."
They are soft small and great for training I recommend breaking them in half for puppies because of the high protein.
"I bought this molasses at a local grocery store and nowhere on the bottle does it state that it is, 'unsulphered'. I called the company and talked to a sales rep in which he stated that it was not unsulphered. Although it does have a higher percentage of iron, I'm going back to Plantation."
"When I stumbled across pink grapefruit tic tacs, I was intrigued enough to order them.  I do enjoy grapefruit flavors and I love tic tacs with intense flavors.  These did not disappoint.  They offer an intense flavor that tastes just like real grapefruit.<br /><br />An unusual treat!"
"i got a jar of this in a gift basket and wasnt sure what to do with it. I decided to try it on some crackers and it was delicious. Its sweet with a nice kick of jalapeno.Since I've had it on burgers, potatoes and vegetables. I quickly went online to order more and found they were sold out, so i signed up here on amazon to be notified when more come in."
I was expecting a bit better after reading other reviews. This is about the same as any other hot chocolate made with water. I prefer making it with milk as the flavor and texture is much better. Adding milk didn't help much. I guess Mom spoiled me (good).
I love it. Tastes great and it is very convenient to use. My husband drinks that in the car instead of soda or juice &lt;just pour the powder to 32oz water bottle and shake well - directions on the box say to use 500ml(16.9oz) but the tea is really strong so we use 1L bottle)> my kids love it I love it. In Whole Food 1 box costs $20 + tax. Here you can get 2 boxes for the price if you use all promotions (currently 35% off) still quite expensive but well worth it!
These chips are the best. Better than regular potato chips. So good in fact I am going to order more
"My wife is 76 years old and is missing a few important chewing molars and found that these walnuts were very light and tender making them very easy to chew and enjoy. I have no chewing problems and enjoy them as well on occasion. I would normally have a negative reaction in my mouth when eating more than one walnut directly out of the shell, but with your dry roasted formula I can eat a handful or two with no side affects. I recently changed my ordering times so we never run out of these delicious nuts; however, we received an extra 6 can shipment about a week after a double order of 12 cans. I would like to review my automated ordering cycle so the canisters do not pile up. In addition, it would be nice to know what the suggested shelf life is for this product in their sealed container? Since your company is in upstate California and we reside in the San Diego area, your shipments do get here quickly after they are ordered manually. This may be a better option for us if we can still get the generous price break you offered for subscribing.  Armen Tavy"
I received a trial packet that made one pot of this coffee. I think it's a good product to try if you like coffee but have to limit your consumption because too much coffee can irritate your stomach.  The aroma is nice and the flavor is good. It still has that little tanginess that makes coffee taste good - without the stomach discomfort that sometimes follows. I didn't add sugar or cream. It's worth a try.
The local merchants quit stocking this. Was pleased to buy this on line so I can make French Canadian pea soup again. 5 stars for ability to obtain since quality is not that much of a factor. All of Bob's Red Mill products are 5 star.
"I thought these were the salted black beans but they turne out to be unsalted or at least they taste like it. I am really looking for the salted, fermented black beans"
"Purchased approximately 24 of these bars in different flavors (the chocolate fudge being my personal favorite, though the brownie crunch is also tasty).  The texture is a bit chewy but the flavor is good...for a protein bar.  Not necessarily on par with the average sugar-filled candy bar of course.  The carb/sugar/protein content is on par with most higher end Gluten Free protein bars I've discovered (including Quest Bars and NoGii).<br /><br />All things considered - flavor, consistency, and quality, I'd likely give these 4 stars.  The issue, however, is that after eating about 6 bars with no issues, I began having gluten reactions to the next three I attempted to eat.  Needless to say, no matter how much protein you consume, your workouts are not going to go well if you're horribly sick.<br /><br />I have written to the company to complain, but cannot afford to take this risk, especially with other comparable bars available.  I caution anyone with Celiac Disease to try these at your own risk, they say GLUTEN FREE on the label, but something was not or a batch became contaminated.  I've been a diagnosed Celiac for over 10 years and I (unfortunately) know the reaction all too well and this bar sparked it.<br /><br />Although I wanted to support this bar for it's high protein content and GF label, I will not buy Think Thin bars again for this reason.  I've moved to Quest Protein Bars for now as I've never had any gluten or allergic reactions to those (and they tend to taste better if you like an almond/caramel type flavor) <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00418OR56"">Quest Bar 2.12 oz. Low Carb, Gluten Free, High Fiber Protein Bars (Box of 12 Bars)</a> - though you'd likely want to buy these from the actual site as they are much cheaper there.<br /><br />Otherwise, if you have no food allergies or specific dietary constraints, these might work for you...good luck!"
The wheat free brownie mix is not to my liking.  I won't be reordering. I'd rather not eat chocolate than to eat these brownies.
"I was looking for a good sweet and sour sauce for chicken and based on the reviews, I took a chance.  Well, no one in the family likes this stuff- it tastes nothing like sweet and sour sauce- more like what it says it is- Chili Sauce.  Now I'm stuck with two huge bottles.  Sometimes reading the label is really all that matters."
"Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat..... not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber..... not more than 3%<br />-Moisture..... not more than 6%"
I read all the reviews before purchasing. Just received the mini sprouter tried to start using but the water keeps leaking out the sides.  Not sure what i could be doing wrong since its only 7 pieces that stack.  Very disappointing!  Returning this ASAP!!
popcorn is very good. but only makes about half of it.tast so good like moive theater popcorn.so so so goooooooooooooooooood
"Our Lab puppy was able to figure out how to turn the red bar and left the dispenser lids, but the angle of the treat pod is such that she can't fit her snout, or manuvuer her tongue very well to get the food.  Even turning her snout sideways didn't help.  The idea has promise but unfortunately the design is lacking.  We'll keep trying but it doesnt really hold her interest since she can't get the reward."
"Like the other reviewer said, this pepper doesn't have much kick - if any at all.  I had a feeling something may have been off - or in this case, nonexistent - and that certainly is the heat.<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this stuff!"
"We switched to this dog food after our 12 yr old mixed breed dog started losing weight and developed severe dermatitis, itching, scratching and shedding! For 12 yrs, we had been giving her a name brand dry product we purchased at local pet stores.  She is a completely different dog these days!  She has gained back all her weight, is happy, and does not itch,scratch or shed.  I HIGHLY recommend this dog food!  It is made of natural, good ingredients."
"Some have already speculated on flavor, so I won't go into that. But some have said how it tastes like an energy drink that has gone flat. Two words: club soda. I've used old water bottles and filled them with club soda, squirting Mio Green thunder energy until it becomes a 'mountain dew-ish' color (about two squirts) and it's like a whole new drink. It's like a generic brand of an energy drink or soda, but without the damaging sugar that dentists cringe at."
"Janie Marie Appleseed prefers the Chinese chicken to the pot pie, and especially laps up its saucy goodness, so score one from the kitty's POV. Me, kitty Mama? I think it would be cool if they were available as one or the other to the box. Or even singly, but guess that probably wouldn't make sense through Amazon. I like that Petite Cuisine is available in small cans, as she never finishes a 6 oz. meal in a single sitting, but wish there was a little plastic lid the right size to fit when she doesn't even finish 3 oz. Also, for my druthers, it's overkill on the packaging. Lose the inner boxes, just stick the 24 cans in the one outer box. Oh, kudos on no food coloring."
"I love these noodles.  They are really great for a midnight snack.  It's not really something that will fill you up for a dinner.  If you do eat it for dinner, you will be hungry later.  Maybe some people wouldn't!!!!  But, it just doesn't stick to my ribs.  I love them though and Amazon has a really good price."
The holiday liquor cups were exactly what I was looking for.  The chocolate is<br />delicious and holds up well to the liquors
"as mentioned...give this a try!  instant party food, frozen meatballs and this sauce... great on chicken, you name it...anything party/snack/happy hour food that you put sauce on would work with this.<br /><br />however the prices from some of the vendors OBSCENE.  $19 for 2 25oz bottles??  This stuff is $1.50-1.75 for the 10oz bottle at any asian grocery...."
"Never had Hawaiian Hazelnut before so I didn't know what to expect, but it turns out it's pretty good, not as flavored as say DD, but nonetheless pretty good. I have it on subscription now along with the German Chocolate Cake, another one of my favorite flavored K-cups."
"I emptied the contents of the tins and used them for other tea. The tea seems to give me bad gas. I think the product could be old, but the date suggets it is still good.<br /><br />As for the taste, I would give the product 4/5 stars.<br /><br />People should give it a try since everybody has different opinions."
Broke right away.... the yellow part broke off and won't fit back on correctly... all the other's I purchased have been great and such a joy watching my lab using her brain to think how to earn each treat.... once the instructional toy is figured out it no longer is a challenge....
"I was not happy about the price of this single package item!!!  What a rip-off!!!  If you can, buy it from the store...I was charged over $12 for a package that costs only $1.99-$2.50 in stores...the problem is finding a store that carries this item"
"I'm not the best cook, but I like to try new things to make my diet healthier.  I confess that I LOVE ramen noodles, and this product helps me cut the salt content.  The flavor packet that comes in Ramen noodles usually has between 600-900 grams of sodium per serving (2 servings in the packet...I eat the whole thing, so that's a LOT of salt.  This Miso contains 880 grams sodium per tablespoon.  I add a table spoon to my ramen, then just a light sprinkle of original flavor packet, cutting the salt almost in half, while still adding a nice savory flavor.  I also add a handful of frozen peas, but I like to keep it simple.  I'm sure there are many other recipes and uses to be found out there, so enjoy!"
"According to an article on CNN.com on 8/5/11, the nutritional content of this brand does not live up to what is on the lable.<br />""Researchers at ConsumerLab.com tested the sodium, potassium, magnesium, and sugar content of three leading brands of coconut water, and they found that only one, Zico Natural, contained the stated amount for all four ingredients.<br /><br />The sugar and potassium content in the other two brands, Vita Coco and O.N.E., also matched the label. But the amounts of sodium and magnesium--two nutrients key to hydration--were as much as 82% and 35% lower, respectively, than the listed amount."""
"Purchased original can at Walmart. Of course, during the holidays - it wasn't always there. I got on Amazon.com and found a really good deal on it. My family & I LOVED it thru the holidays and will be taking a canister of it with us when we go camping and using it year round. Good good product & taste!"
"This is basically candy masquerading as a ""healthy"" snack. They taste good - because they have three different kinds of sugar in them! Blue Diamond  wants you to think that eating sugar is a healthy snack - c'mon!<br /><br />I purchased these thinking they were sweetened with stevia. Yeah, there's a miniscule amount of stevia (very last ingredient) - but sugars are the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th ingredient listed. These have corn maltodextrin - the worst thing there is on the glycemic index (can you say fat formation?). Now I'm stuck with 3 containers of this sugar snack."
Paul Prudhomme makes great seafood seasoning and pork and veal seasoning. I found the Vegetable Seasoning to be too spicy.
"These are perhaps the worst chips that have ever gone into my mouth.<br /><br />For my entire life Sour Cream & Onion (and in this case ""& Chive"") chips were my favorite. Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br /><br />I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them. Hopefully they'll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips."
"I had this product for literally only a week, and had only used it one time. When trying to use it again I found that it wasn't sending the sound through. When I plug it into my PC, it recognizes it and the icicle lights up, and i select it as my recording device, but then when i actually try to record, it makes no sound at all (and i have tried moving the gain knob around so it's not that) This was a complete waste of money, unless there's an easy fix that i'm missing..."
"I was looking for a replacement for Knorr's Carbonara sauce mix because the grocery stores don't carry it anymore in my area.  Wagner's is creamy enough, but it doesn't have the bacon flavor that I have come to expect in carbonara.  I don't recommend it unless you add your own bacon."
"I have always trusted the ""Newman's Own"" brand.  From popcorn to salad dressings, I have never been disappointed in one of their products.  Until now.  Each dog treat is scored to break it easy and is of similar size to a fig newton about 2"" X 1-1/4 inch and quite thick - about 1/2 inch. And hard as a rock.  I am all for organic products, but when my dogs don't care for them, it's not like I can bribe them to eat it like I can with kids.  Our dogs are around 15-20 pounds and I think these dog treats are a little bit too hard for them.  The first time we tried to feet these treats to them they turned up their noses. They were absolutely NOT interested at all.  The next time we tried they carried them around in their mouths for a minute or so, and decided, for some reason, that they were inedible.  However, the third try must have been when they were REALLY hungry because they appeared more interested. But this is more like rawhide than a ""treat"". Our dogs really had to work on this for a long time. Our younger dog, a Shih Tzu did okay and after about 15 minutes was making headway on eating it.  Our elderly Japanese Chin who is 14 (that's 98 in dog years) was  much more fussy.  She seemed interested for awhile and even though she still has all her teeth, she just couldn't be enticed to do much more than sniff it. Perhaps a larger dog would like these better. I haven't given up on ""Newman's Own"" brand but I doubt that I'll try their New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Biscuits (made with lamb and barley)again."
"Nabisco knew if they didnt put little things that give this much pleasure in little baglets, we would keep dipping our hand in the bag and in a couple years would all weigh 400 lbs, die an early death and no longer be able to give Nabisco money.<br /><br />Kidding aside, these are loveable. The texture is perfection. If you feel like chewing them quickly or take it slowly and let the light wafer melt in your mouth."
"Sierra Mist Diet Cranberry Splash is the best tasting soda to be released.  I've enjoyed it for several weeks now, but can't find it anywhere in the St. Louis market presently."
"My bog loves these dental chews more than any other treat I have ever given him.  As a bonus they seem to give my dog better smelling breath.  Just so that it doesn't take you by surprise, they will turn your dog's poop a darker shade because of the coloring.<br /><br />I highly recommend these."
The recipient loved this gift. The minute they opened it they decided to have a party to taste the beer. Would give as a gift again!
"If you only knew....<br /><br />Bisquick Gluten Free(GF) is by far one of the best options out there for people with Celiac or Sensitivity to Gluten.<br />I honestly don't know how healthy it is for you. What I do know it that it is a great option for people trying<br />to eat as normal as possible. This GF option has been a great meal saver for my wife who this last year was diagnosed<br />with Celiac and got sick in tired of tasting gross tasting GF options or super simple meat and vegetables options for meals.<br /><br />We have made all types of breakfast items, biscuits, even fried food (chicken tenders, mozzarella sticks, fried fruit,...) We bout our own little frier<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0016NQ49Q/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=talkinhome-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=B0016NQ49Q&adid=0XK6HZPJRKAED855HEWP<br /><br />In short, It has not only been a great option, but also has been quite tasty allowing my wife to make one meal for both of us not worrying that<br />it will taste bad to me.<br /><br />Hope this was helpful."
This coffee has a smoother and milder taste than a dark roasted coffee.  I like to have this coffee and a dark roasted on alternate mornings.  The daily contrast in taste keeps me appreciating the delicious coffee favors of each type.
"i always enjoy Jello pudding, however, one package that i recieved was opened, and the powder spilled all over.  it really alters the price when you only recieve 23 packages instead of the promised 24."
"So tasty and delicious, a must have in my pantry. Easy on the teeth and bladder for those who need that information and super tasty. I drink it all the time. Yum!"
"I bought this for my husband since he loves Ranch. He uses ranch dressing with everything. Before I bought it, I read a review that said it taste good inspite of the fat-free... Well, my husband had it and says it's aweful. I guess ""to each his own"" everyone's tastebuds are not alike.  Someone else may like it, so I am not going to discourage anyone from trying it. However, I had to cancel my subscription because the only one that likes Ranch in the family, doesn't like this one. I guess he needs the fat:)"
"I usually purchase these by the case at a local Walgreen's, saw them here, and with free shipping, for about 1/3 less than I usually pay...well, I hesitated, thought ""what if they are old and stale, probably why they are so much cheaper.."". Well, I decided to go ahead and try them, and am so glad I did! They are as fresh, maybe fresher than the ones I have purchased local. I notice now, as I am leaving this review, they are no longer free shipping, and with the price of shipping, makes them about what I pay locally...so, I hope they go back to offer free shipping, as I love these candies, and buy them quite often. Bring back free shipping, keep the freshness!!!"
"We have been living gluten-free for 5 years now, and this mix is the best I have found!  It makes great waffles."
"This is the best tasting coffee available on k-cups!!!! The flavor is amazing, it is more expensive than other brands, but for a reason. Definitely worth trying."
"Like many others have said, Gnats! It would be a fine product except for that. Used some insecticidal soap, so far so good. Caveat emptor!"
"I bought this because the store was out of my brand.  I was disappointed with this coffee.  Not very flavorful, and the flavor is just ok.  Wouldn't buy again."
"This dogfood has never been recalled, has protein as the first two ingredients, and is organic. Doesnt make my dog throw up like when she tries other dogfoods full of fat and fakeness. Cant get better!"
We use these popcorn packs for our party rental business. We can keep enough in stock. They are easy for our customers to use and taste great!
"This pecan meal is more like bran flakes than pecans.  I had thought it was ground pecans, and the name would indicate that.  The container it came in is very light, which was my first clue it was not exactly the whole pecan nut meat.  The ""meal"" is flaky.  The price might have been a clue, I suppose, since the per pound price of pecans is over $12 most places."
"The first time I tried this product to make pancakes, I thought it was terrible.  I made it according to the directions and used the ""right"" measuring cups for liquid and dry ingredients, but found that the batter came out thin and the texture was gummy.  Then, one day when I was visiting my mother, she decided to make pancakes, and since I am GF, she had bought this mix for me (not knowing I had already hated it).  I saw that she measured the ingredients ""incorrectly"" as she used the same measuring cup (generally used to measure liquids) for both the dry and the liquid ingredients.  She also used a whisk to mix the ingredients.  Amazingly enough, the pancakes came out fluffy, and I really liked it.  In fact, it is my favorite gluten free pancake mix so far.  Having said that, both my husband and I are of the opinion that this product still has a bit of the gritty texture that is present in many gf products.  However, it is the best pancake mix that I have found so far."
"For me they are the best chocolate I've ever eat., a little bit chocolate and peppermint, I love it."
My wife loves this oatmeal and she can't always find it. I get it here for a good price. I hope they will keep carrying it.
This stuff is great! cant get enough ive tried the others and they dont compare! but it is hard to find in stores :(
I prefer the reg. stevia pkts. from this company as opposed to the liquid flavors.  had a funky taste to it.
"The flavor of these nuts is similar to cinnamon toast cereal, yet they are filling and healthy, containing little sugar and almost no salt. I would deduct a star for being priced too high both here and in the supermarket, but Blue Diamond deserves credit for their restraint in using quality ingredients and in not producing a sugar encrusted candy. Now if they would only go against the trend of charging a huge markup for minimal extra processing cost...<br /><br />The other reviewer seems to think these contain lactose. The ingredients:<br />ALMONDS, EVAPORATED CANE JUICE, BROWN SUGAR, CORN MALTODEXTRIN, CINNAMON, NATURAL FLAVORS AND SALT. PEANUT FREE. MAY CONTAIN OTHER TREE NUTS. Unless OTHER TREE NUTS comes from cows, I don't think this is true."
"There should be an option for a 0 star rating because that is what I would rate this item.<br />First, the sampling was to include 9 varieties but included only 7.  It appears that the two flavors out of stock were not substituted with two other flavors but instead a few more of the remaining flavors were tossed in the box. I had expected that when a limited edition coffee flavor such as Island Coconut was out of stock, it would be replaced with a different limited edition coffee flavor.  Same thing for the Half and Half Lemonade.<br />Second, the order was not balanced.  Of the 7 flavors I did receive, only 2 were coffees, the remaining 5 were teas.<br />The concept of a summer sampler set is a good one but the execution here was an epic fail.  The order is being returned today."
"I used to regularly eat pretzels as snacks or part of my lunches for work.  Although I never really followed along with the low carb diet craze, I did become concerned that pretzels weren't providing me with any nutrition other than carbohydrates, so I gradually stopped buying them.<br /><br />Then someone told me about Newman Hi-Protein Pretzels.  Each generous serving size (18 pretzels) is just 120 calories, but you get 5 grams of protein and 4 grams of fiber, with only 1.5 grams fat!  That's better than what you might get from a lot of yogurts that are on the market today.  Furthermore, like all Newman products, these pretzels are made with all-natural ingredients, including what flour,n pea flour, sunflower oil, and salt.  And finally, they taste great!  I truly cannot taste any difference between these pretzels and others--well, if anything, these are better. :)<br /><br />If you are looking for a delicious snack that is nutritious, too, I highly recommend Newman's Hi-Protein Pretzels."
I agree with the reviewer who said it won't give you 100% the firmness of jello but it does satisfy my cravings!  Wonderful product!
"I have used this product for a few years now, my family and I love how it adds flavor to our salads and frozen vegetable dishes. Problem was I could only get it at a few grocery stores when I would go home to Florida to visit, then I couldn't find it at those stores anymore. I was happy to find it on Amazon and ordered the case quantity which will last a long time."
"I have not had this drink in years.  The first time I had it was in Connecticut at an Au Bon Pain restaurant.  I was recently in the Virginia Highlands area in Atlanta in a very cool coffee, wine grocery store and they had it.  My daughter loved it so I began to search online for it since they don't sell it in my area.  It is so fresh and delicious.  Wish it was easier to get.  Great service with this order, however shipping amount very high."
They grow well in my sprouter and the taste great. Sometimes I just eat them plain.
"This Hot cocoa is the nastiest tasting instant cocoa I've ever had. I know it's not going to taste like the real thing, but after just three cups I can't bring myself to finishing the box. I think I'll just throw them out. Our k-cup machine is about a month old and the coffee flavors we've tried are all fine so we wanted to try the cocoa. The first try was very watery so I thought the cup size needs to be reduced. This results in just a sweeter cup of hot water. Stick with coffee."
I have been a loyal POP chip customer for a while now and wanted to try some of the new flavors. I ordered the variety pack on Sept 15th and it said in stock. Now exactly a month later I have still not even received and ETA on when they might be shipped. I am very disappointed!!!
"These are, without question, the best ""diet"" crackers I've ever had.  I've had them with and without salt and since I usually put peanut butter on them, I didn't need the salt.<br /><br />These are great for travel, for kids, and when you just need a very low-calorie cracker."
Great for stocking up and keeping a few in the closet. I like to buy things in bulk and this was a good deal and smells good too.
"I bought a 2-pack of the liver flavored Everlasting Treats to see if my husky/g.shepherd puppy would like them. She ate the first one in one sitting. That wasn't very ""everlasting"" and at nearly $4/ea it was an expensive treat. The 2nd one she took 2 - 3 days to eat, so I decided I would buy more of them as an occasional treat. My next puchase included the treat ball and a couple of other flavors (BBQ and Vanilla Mint). I put a Liver and a Vanilla Mint in the treat ball and she went LOVED the VM. It took effort this time to enjoy it, and she worked on it for over a week until there was nothing left but a disk of the treat in the treat ball (so I removed it, gave it to her, and put a new treat in the ball). The ball definitely helped a lot in slowing down the consumption time of the treat and she enjoys playing with it.<br /><br />Two paws up!"
"I drink this on days that I'm feeling sluggish.  It definitely gives me more pep.  Not crazy about the taste, but I love the effects."
"Simply put....I love this coffee!!! It's my favorite!!! Hard to find sometimes, so I make sure I have extra on hand!!! It has a nice rich, bold taste! If you like the taste of coffee, you won't be disappointed!!!"
"if the house catches fire, I will grab my husband, amnimals and senseo.  I love the french vanilla coffee pods.  I use one pod and select the 2 cup option as I dont like strong coffee.  You will instantly fall in love with the foam that is on top of the coffee.  Use fat free/ carb free vanilla creamer and you have a mighty tasty cup of coffee!!!!"
"I absolutely love this spiced tea. I was not a big tea drinker but this one is something.. Do give it a try, I bet you will love it. :)"
This product comes off as natural but let's not forget people that canola oil is a horrible oil.  And if it isn't stated as non-GMO than IT IS.
"My honey has a serious sweet tooth, which I accommodate by preparing him a weekly dessert. Martha White's Muffin Mix is very convenient to prepare because it only requires one-half cup of milk, which I toss into my cuisinart; and wah-la six beautiful muffins with virtually no prep time. They are moist, delicious, and economic."
"I used to buy this sugar for years. I do not eat much sugar, but still. This sugar is called turbinado sugar, but is misleading. I picked this brand just because it says real turbinado sugar, and other brands (in the local food store) that their sugar is brown because it is colored with caramel or something.<br /><br />HOW did i find out? I needed just a sweet water few days ago. I put this Sugar in The Raw in the glass. The water became brown and on the bottom of the glass i got just PURE WHITE SUGAR CRYSTALS!!!!! What a shame on the producer! U can try to put this sugar in your mouth and after few seconds you will spit out pure white crystals as well.<br /><br />I'm just wondering if the consumers can hold the company liable for such a practice."
"I bought Nutiva organic chia seeds before, two pouches 14 ounces each - $16.24 with tax, this brand in one 16-ounce pouch $14.83. The quality and the taste are the same, but the latter one is WAY much more expensive. Buy Nutiva Organic Chia seeds, not Navitas. In terms of the taste, I usually toast mine and add them everywhere - cereal, yogurt, oatmeal, etc. Tastes great and full of fiber."
"My experience with this was a disaster. The first push on the applicator sent gobs of the bait all over the place.  Because of the size of the tube's opening, you cannot control the amount of bait you apply. With a slight pressure on the applicator nothing comes out; anything stronger and you have a mess.  I have no idea how the bait itself works- I had to clean it all up."
"Nice to have coffee delivered right to your doorstep.  I had gotten the variety pack, so I could see which coffee I liked the best and this was the coffee for me."
I was so excited to get this and try it.  Unfortunately I'm not impressed.<br /><br />For starters the value is terrible.  You get 3 cups of mix per box.  That's enough to make 1 batch of pancakes and 1 batch of biscuits (or 3 batches of pancakes whatever).  For almost 4.50 a box that's not worth it to me especially when the end result is mediocre at best.  For the biscuits I made cheddar biscuits and not even the bread loving toddler would eat them.  The pancakes were okay if I used twice as much real maple syrup as I normally do.<br /><br />The pro's?<br />The biscuits did puff up nicely.  That's the only pro I have.
I love this coffee and the price is remarkable for a gourmet product. I have bought from other high-end coffee dealers and spent an arm and a leg and waited a lot longer to receive it. Very quick delivery. Excellent price and product. Can't wait to try the next flavor.
"These are a great deal when compared to the small bags of treats available at the pet store. More importantly, my dog adores them. I use them as an extra special treat, usually just for when he goes into his crate. As soon as he notices that I have one in my hand, he runs to his crate and waits, tail wagging. The only downside is that the liver cubes smell horrible (to humans, anyway) and leave a powdery residue behind. But as some other reviews have noted, the powder is great for sprinkling on dry food for a finicky dog."
I have orderred Jeremiah's Pick Coffee Organic Breakfast Blend Whole Bean Coffee more than 5 times however the last lot I received with really bad quality. Lots of broken coffee beans and very oily. Hope the seller can check what happen...I may not try it again.
"A friend of mine recommended these chocolate nibs and I love them. They arrived promptly and undamaged. And most importantly, the price was great!<br />:)"
"I can't eat these oats, they have a funny taste to them.  My kids also think they taste funny.  My husband thinks they are OK, so he has 50 pounds of oats to eat on his own!"
"I tried this cereal the other day and really liked it.  I paid $3.19 for a box at my local Target store.<br /><br />I came onto Amazon to see if they sold it since they seem to carry alot of the same items that Target does.<br /><br />Well, I come across this and am a little confused.  $14.99 for one box of cereal?  Is this right?"
"I like the ingredients that these biscuits have -- everything's organic -- meat, veggies, and grains.  Each biscuit comes in two squares, so I tried to break the biscuit in half to separate the two squares and found it very difficult.  Those biscuits were hard!  I also smelled the biscuits and didn't notice much flavor/scent at all.<br /><br />I gave one square each to my two dogs.  While my one-year-old dog gobbled it up (as she does with everything, and may have swallowed it whole for all I know), my six-year-old dog was hesitant at first.  He sniffed it a bit and then had a very hard time taking that first bite into the very hard biscuit.  I think he was afraid of breaking his teeth!  (And he chews on very hard toys/bones/rawhide.)  He didn't seem too wild about the taste either, as he wasn't in any rush to finish the square after he broke into it.  They looked and probably tasted like cardboard, so I can see why.<br /><br />I appreciate what Newman's is trying to do for dogs in giving them healthier snack alternatives, but please don't break my dogs' teeth!"
"I've always hated the Peete's or Starbucks burnt-bitter taste. This is a great blend, still strong without the burn roasting.<br /><br />FYI, low quality beans are burned to hide it's bad taste."
"I enjoyed these k-cups when I used them. They tasted pretty good. However, I quickly noticed that my Keurig brewer began to have problems after I started using these and other Grove Square k-cups. Even when I would brew other cups, I would get half-brewed cups of coffee, smaller cups, and other issues. I cleaned the brewer, following all the instructions and tips in the manual. The issues came up again as soon as I used these k-cups. What I discovered is that the Grove Square k-cups were gunking up my brewer badly. I had to clean out every part of the brewer completely, including the brewer basket area, the water reservoir, and the internal mechanism. After completing the entire cleaning process two more times my brewer got back to normal. I won't order any Grove Square products again."
This popcorn has alot of hulls I order 4 bags and can't stand to eat it it's so hully - terrible
"Yuck, these do not taste good and they are quite tough. Better off buying the bags of rinds already prepaired."
What a RIP-OFF. These chocolate bars can be found in the dollar aisle of many grocery stores.  They are also found in some 99-cent stores.  Don't be fooled into paying $8.94 (including shipping) for a $1.00 chocolate bar!
"I had seen Nutella in the States growing up but didn't really become a heavy user until I lived in Europe for a year. This stuff is amazing - it's super chocolatey with a hint of hazelnut that gives it a really full-bodied, mature flavor. I usually put it on bagels or English muffins as a quick, satisfying dessert. It's also great for baking (Nutella brownies are awesome!)<br /><br />In terms of nutrition, the calories per tablespoon of Nutella is pretty close to the American sandwich staple, peanut butter. Nutella doesn't have quite as much protein as peanut butter but it also doesn't have as much fat or sodium, so there's a trade off.<br /><br />All in all I LOVE this spread and I always have a big jar in my pantry."
"I would not buy this particular Yogi Tea again because I hate the taste of licorice/anise.  The flavor of the licorice and fennel seed is very dominant, making it a sort of sickly sweet flavor which wasn't what I was hoping for with my burning throat.  I think a better blend would be something with more ""heat"" like ginger, which is why I usually drink Yogi's Cold Season instead, for the same purpose.<br /><br />With a sore throat, its reasonable to suffer through a yucky flavor if it makes a discernible difference but this tea didn't do that."
"If I drank more than one commuter cup in the morning I'd probably need to back off the caffeine a notch or two, but this espresso (made in my stove-top espresso maker) is delicious and (almost) worth getting out of bed for."
"I bought this for my girlfriend as she had been having tummy issues and she absolutely loves it.  Now it seems assumed I will keep her in stock.  That alludes to a completely different product review.  The point is, buying it in bulk grants the obvious versatility of making tea bags when on the go or strainers when home.  It seems very economical without sacrificing quality in the least.  My only wish is that they would institute the subscribe and save feature here for those who are hooked and are loyal customers.  My GF usually gets what she wants."
"I have always made my own pancake and waffle mix; no pre-made stuff for me!!  I tried this mix and not one person really liked it.  It is a heavy, cornmeal floury taste.  Back to my own recipe."
This low-carb pasta is not like any other low carb pasta. It is made with semolina and taste better than any dried high carb pasta. Absolutely the best dried pasta I have ever eaten and it is really low carb.
"They are a healthier chip with less salt and fat, which I like better than the over-salted regular chips on the market.  The flavor is great and they are nice and crunchy. Absolutely worth a try!"
"If you like the wasabi peas that you can get at the grocery store but, you want a little more kick, these are the bad boys that you're looking for."
"Not only are these brownies very tasty, they are very easy to make. I use a brownie pan (11 x 7) and they come out perfect every time. I wish they made a bigger batch because they don't last long in my house. My family members, who are not on a gluten-free diet, really like these brownies. I am glad I can buy them in bulk on Amazon along with other gluten-free groceries too."
"I rescued my dog a year ago. Ever since then, I've been feeding him Newman's. I like that the main ingredient is a form of meat and there isn't a lot of grain type of ingredients. All of the ingredients are organic, so it's really good for my dog. I've tried several other brands with my dog. But I don't think he's really allergic to anything or has a distaste for anything in particular. And since this is one of the cheaper brands out there that is still nutritious, I decided to stick to this brand. Ordering it on Amazon is very convenient because I can use the Subscribe & Save feature and set the schedule of when I want the dog food delivered. I never have to worry about running out of dog food!"
Pop Chips are the best chips I've had that are low calorie. The originals are my favorite but the Sea Salt and Vinegar are very very good also.
"I relied on the ingredients listed on Amazon's site.<br /><br />Ingredients<br />Peanuts, Dry Roast Seasoning, Tapioca Dextrin, Natural Flavoring, Salt.<br /><br />Guess what? When the product arrived I read the laundry list of about 20 other ingredients.<br />According to the actual label the Dry Roast ""seasoning"" contains MSG.<br />Now I'm not that paranoid about MSG but if the product has it as an ingredient it should have been listed on Amazon.<br />I wish they had shown the nutrition label. It also contains added sugar.<br />What's wrong with plain dry roasted peanuts?<br />The taste is about what you would expect. Peanuts with a flavor coating.<br />I will not buy them again.<br />Also it is a 12 pack."
"Plain coconut water?  No thanks.  Flavored coconut water?  Yes PLEASE!  This is my favorite of all flavors.  So refreshing, hydrating and good for you all in one!"
"I bought this because it was a very good price.  It was really good though.  I love mixing a peppermint with a dark chocolate and having a double sized up of hot cocoa.<br /><br />Will keep buying this until they don't sell it anymore. It is really creamy.  I like it best with 6 ounces of water, gives it a thicker feel."
"Tasty noodles.  They are a little wider than I envisioned. Once I lowered my cooking time they started coming out a little firmer, which is more what our family prefers."
"This 100% juice, carbonated beverage is a good alternative to traditional soda. As a somewhat health-conscious consumer, I avoid high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) as much as possible. This beverage contains no HFCS, no added sugar, no preservatives, and no added color. I'm sampling the orange flavor. It contains 100% of your daily recommended dose of Vitamin C, and 20% of your Vitamin A for the day. The downside is a single 8.3 fl oz can contains almost as many calories as a 12 oz a can of soda.<br /><br />The Orange-Tangerine flavor reminds me a bit of Orangina. Perhaps you've tried Crystal Geyser's Fruit Squeeze beverages which are also similar. It's definitely not comparable to artificially flavored orange beverages (Sunkist, Crush). It has a hint of grapefruit-like taste to it, but without the bitterness, which may be due to the added apple, grape, and acerola concentrates. The aftertaste is a bit metallic to me. The beverage itself is clear - without pulp of any kind - and is light-orange-yellow in color.<br /><br />This is a good alternative to those looking for something soda-like, but healthier than all the HFCS-loaded options. Maybe it's a good option for parents to give to their kids if their kids drink a lot of soda anyway. Personally, I don't enjoy it enough to buy it instead of other available, similar products. If I want orange juice or crave soda, I'll rather drink the real thing."
"Quaker Instant Maple Brown Sugar oatmeal is a hearty dish for breakfast.  It's tasty, filling, and easy to prepare.  The ease of preparation is important for working folks who don't want to rush to work with an empty stomach.  Combined with a cup of coffee or a glass of orange juice, the oatmeal will definitely hold and fortify you until lunch.<br /><br />It also makes for a good snack, instead of overly salty and sugar-rich foods.  I know many people put sugar and milk in their oatmeal, but I'm a purest.  I enjoy it just plain.  It's sweet enough to tingle one's taste buds, but not so sweet as to make it feel as if you're eating candy.  Instant foods suffer a generally bad reputation.  When ""ease of preparation"" is a primary consideration, often flavor suffers.  Not so here.  There was plenty of maple flavor.<br /><br />There are two options for preparing the instant oatmeal, one involving boiling water, the other tap water and the microwave.  I combined the two, because I like really hot oatmeal.  First I added boiling water, as directed, and let the oatmeal stand for a minute or so.  Then I gave it a 15-second nuke in the microwave.  The result was perfect for me.  If this sounds like too much preparation, stick with one of the prescribed methods, listed on the box.<br /><br />I'm not a really devoted oatmeal eater, so I may not be the ultimate authority on this product.  My review is based on the flavor (quite pleasant), preparation time (swift), and texture (just right, not too watery, not lumpy).  As with any food, individual taste is a major factor."
"I like Japanese soups and just love the similar products from San-J (also available from Amazon -- get those, they're 5-star!).<br /><br />This Miso-cup brand is terrible. I can't tell you more than this is just yicky. I wish there was a zero-star rating!<br /><br />I didn't finish the first cup even (but I'd already tried and re-tried another Miso-cup flavor and hated it). Therefore, I only used one envelope before giving away the rest. Oh, why did I stray from San-J? Actually, I thought it might be worth trying Miso-cup's different flavors to add variety to my afternoon broth experience. It was this flavor, in particular, that I was most interested in trying for variety. But now I know that ALL the Miso-cup brand are equally dreadful!!!<br /><br />I gave these and the other Miso-cup boxes to a Food Pantry BUT I told them first why to warn others it might not suit them. Get the San-J brand!!!"
"The 4 pounds of sliced meat itself are contained in a single cardboard box; no vacuum seal or even plastic wrap.  That box is placed in another box that is lined with styrofoam sides, styrofoam peanuts, and three frozen ""ice"" paks.  It was shipped FedEx 2 Day (that's what the label says), not Overnight or next business day, which begs the question, what exactly did the $52 in shipping charges for 4 lbs of meat and minimal packing materials actually go towards?  I think I know, and it wasn't shipping.<br /><br />Years ago ""Grecian Delight"" (the brand on the box) was sold in a local supermarket chain in Gyro Kit boxes - each contained a pack of sliced gyro meat, one pita, and a small container of tzatziki sauce.  I loved them, but I haven't seen the kits in decades and was happy to find a way to once again stock the freezer with gyros-in-waiting.<br /><br />The gyro meat itself, which I have ordered before, tastes just like ... gyro meat!  As I said, I love gyros, but there's no place nearby where I can drop in and enjoy one.  So I have ordered the product in the past, but in this case, I've ordered for the last time.<br /><br />I've gotten the individual 1 lb vacuum packets before 3 at a time and they've arrived frozen or nearly frozen. Not so this box.  The meat was not only thawed, it was only slightly cool. I'm afraid I'm going to be throwing it out.  Too risky.  For $52 shipping charges, it should have arrived in perfect condition. Overnight. I won't make this mistake again.  I can't afford to."
The lids are impossible to secure.  This purchase was a complete waste of money.  Product cannot be used as lids are unable to be secured.
My little dog loves these treats. Besides rewarding my dog I crash treats and mix it with medicine. It works great.
"Purchased this for my 3 year old Dalmatian who suffers from separation anxiety and boredom when my husband and I leave for work.  We put his breakfast in the Tug-A-Jug, and he went from howling when we left, to happily chasing his toy around to get his food.  He isn't a major chewer, but has ripped things up in the past.  This toy shows some minor scratches (we've had it for about 6 months), but they are all cosmetic-nothing structural.  So that's the good news.<br /><br />The bad news?  The rope gets super smelly.  Since we wanted to use this to feed our dog breakfast, we aren't using the Premier brand treat inserts, we are using just normal kibbles.  After about a month of use, the toy began to smell, so we sent it through the dishwasher.  The only problem is that the rope never fully dries out, and the smell came back quickly, and worse.  Now, if we want it clean, I have to soak it in bleach water, then hand wash, then dish wash, and then put it in the oven on the lowest setting so the rope fully dries out.  For me, this is too much work.  We're ordering a kong to see if we can save on some of the clean up time."
"I ordered this as it is the food I always use and pay $52 for the large bag, didn't realize I was getting the small 4.4 lb bag.  This is not a deal.  It is higher than I pay at the pet store!"
"I drink mostly German and Brazilian coffees for their smooth, strong flavor.  I received Ola's coffee as a gift and found it to be as pleasing as my favorites.  Ola's has no bitter/acidic taste and is strong enough to please this palate!  For an organic, free trade coffee this one is delicious!"
Very pleased to find this product.  Fantastic purchase for anyone who uses pumpkin pie or any other spice in large quantities.  It was reasonably priced and Marshall's Creek Spices is on my list for future orders of their products via Amazon.  Will definitely order again when needed.
"Well you get what you paid for. While this milk chocolate k-cup is pretty cheap $12.95 per 24 (54 cents per count) but it is not good. It tasted like watered down chocolate (as if you put in too much water and not enough milk or chocolate/cacao for that matter). This thing is sweet tho, in fact kinda too sweet for my taste (i am beginning to think half of the powdery content is sugar/sweetener). I thought it was the amount of water that made it taste watered down so I lowered the cup size from 8 ounce to 6 ounce on my Keurig brewer and it's the same thing."
"I liked the popchips, specially the taste and low calorie fact.<br />Also the individial serve bags keeps them fresh and pack just what<br />you need need for a snack."
"All of the Kind Bars are simply delicious with large portions that satisfy any sweet tooth.  They average 12 carbs with plenty of fiber to bring the net carbs down to 8.  The ingredients are simple; nuts and dried fruit with a little honey, but each bars packs a great deal of flavor.  One taste will have you choosing Kind Bars over any candy bar.  Unlike other ""health"" bars that have hidden calories these bars are simply fruit and nut with nothing else added."
"Pop Chips are delicious, light and tasty. I bought a box of the Parmesan Garlic and it almost dissapeared before I had a chance to eat some of them."
"This egg protein is great!<br />First off, it is sweetened with Stevia, a natural herb, and not some artificial sweetener like aspartame or sucralose.<br />Next, it is very easy on the stomach, even whey without lactose is a lot harder on my digestion system it seems.<br />It tastes good, mixes well, and is a good value.<br />I bought all 3 flavors and found I prefer the vanilla.<br />Goes really well with some almond milk and blueberries.<br />I'm glad I've found a pure protein source that is dairy and soy free."
"I eat them just like this!  I like something with substance to it, and when you eat these, you know you're eating something.  They're healthy, taste good, and are reasonably priced."
"Here is a nutritional breakdown:<br /><br />Calories: 100<br />Calories from Fat: 30<br />Total Fat: 3g<br />Saturated Fat, Trans Fat, Poly and Mono: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 160mg - 7%<br />Potassium 180mg - 5%<br />Total Carbohydrates 15g - 5%<br />Dietary Fiber 1g - 4%<br />Sugars 2g - 4%<br />Protein 1g<br />Calcium 2%<br />Iron 2%<br /><br />For Weightwatcher folks this breaksdown to 2 Points......."
"I've eaten a few of these, and while they tasted interesting at first, I can't bite into one now without gagging.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I was looking for some high-protein snacks so I picked these up.  A vegetarian friend of mine tried one and instantly hated them, calling the taste ""disgusting"" and the texture ""too much like meat.""  The taste is not something that grows on you and I can not recommend these to anyone, especially at this price."
"I am a fan of spices... No one has what Tabasco has. The healthiest out there. Only 30 mg of salt per spoon. Others not only cannot compete with Tabasco's taste but they have 200 plus mg of salt in each spoon. That is ridiculous amount of salt. Do not need to refrigerate the Tabasco bottle for one year at all so you can leave it outside at room temperature.  I have been using Tabasco for 40 years all over the world. I add <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNS55A"">TABASCO brand Pepper Sauce - Original Red Gallon</a> to all my dishes since it is the spiciest of all. It is not thick like the Chipotle but it is very unique test when I am making dishes that have many different ingredients since it mixes well. I add <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNZRKQ"">TABASCO brand Chipotle Pepper Sauce - Gallon</a> to the tortilla pizza that I make with cheese and herring since this is heavier and tastier but not as spicy as the original red or green. I add the green <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HNQV2Y"">TABASCO brand Green Jalapeno Pepper Sauce - Gallon</a> with anything that I make with eggs including the egg sandwich in between tortillas since this is the best with eggs. I love beans and lintels so after cooking those I add serrano chilli pepper deeped in Italian vinegar, extra virgin olive oil, eggplant and the Habanero <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002HO0F1Q"">TABASCO brand Habanero Sauce - Gallon</a> and I can tell you that becomes real hot. I place the mix in between hot tortilla with avocados for consumption. Now that does not mean that I am limited with these food selections since many times I may mix all those Tabascos together. Regardless, I have never been disappointed since it is truly delicious, spicy, hot without all the garbage and additives that it is out there in other brands without the taste. I have a very healthy diet and I consume healthy food without additives. Thanks and Double bravo to Tabasco."
These nuts arrived fresh and are very tasty.  They are not broken or dirty looking like cashews sometimes can.
"This tea is incredible!! The complexity of the flavor is mind tingling.  Like a fine wine, fermented pu-erh tea gets better with age, and this product surprised me with its excellence."
"These arrived fresh and in very good shape, Just like buying from the local store only cheaper and delivered to my door!"
"Happy Hips are one of my little monster's favorite treats.  She is a very finicky eater but she will obey and be sweet for a chance at these chip like treats.<br /><br />This product was recommended to me by another dog owner as a healthy treat because it contains no fillers, byproducts, antibiotics, or added hormones. It also has vitamins and minerals to maintain healthy joints, which for a French Bulldog that has problems with hips and joints, is a plus.  I feel better about giving the little critter a healthy treat instead of the garbage contained in brand name treats on the market.<br /><br />One huge red flag is they are made in China, which certainly gives me pause, but I will keep buying them.<br />I have only tried the beef liver variety and will stick with it since my little creature likes them so much."
If you like stuffed olives get this.  Only compliant is pain to clean.  Easy to use.  You can make much better olives then expensive ones in store.
"I was pleasantly surprised with this coconut sugar! It has a very earthy, slight maple flavor. It doesn't have an overly sweet sweetness as white sugar does. I've used it in tea and also made banana muffins which came out tasting wonderfully! I did not notice any coconut flavor at all, which wouldn't have mattered either way for me. I will continue to use this in place of white or brown sugar in our home."
They said the salt and vinegar were horrible! Blecht! Couldn't get the awful taste out of their mouth. Now i'm stuck with this box of popchips! lol.
These quickly became dog treats!  Just nasty!  I don't even know how they can sell these for human comsumption!  Stay away!
"I have been using canidae for 5 years now along with nuvet vitamins  and it has been a wonderful product. After the ingredients change I have not noticed any sort of change in my siberian huskies what so ever. They still have high energy, very lush coats,white teeth and great done density. I am very happy with this product i have had no problems!"
This popcorn brings me back to days before the microwave version. What a treat it was to savor the taste and lightly salted lily white popcorn that was popped over the heat of a stove burner again.
"Switch is a tangy drink that's more reminiscent of Sprite than Orange Juice. It's carbonated all the way and you will even burp after it as you would've after consuming any soft drink. The drink doesn't feel sugary, but a quick glance at the nutritional facts reveals that each can contains 34 grams of sugar. The claim on the can is that there are no additional sugars added, so I'm assuming that's the sugar from the orange and tangerine. The can"
"The tree is nice, but that is the only part besides the pot.  Did NOT come with a matching drip tray, as promised.  Instructions were lacking information and were merely a printed piece of paper."
"I love rye. Used to eat the thick rye crisps, but my old teeth just can't handle them anymore.  But I still love some crunch. I also like to eat healthier and these crisp thins are whole grain and have more fiber than many bread options.<br /><br />It was getting harder to find them locally so I started getting them here on Amazon so I never have to be w/o my favorite cracker! Another bonus - I've had these around the house for years but my kids never showed any interest (just some weird thing mom ate) until I ordered a whole box of them last month. My last daughter still at home thought maybe she should try them since I bought so many. Now she's hooked so she's taking them off to college with her!"
This looks and smells great but my son didn't really like it.  the texture is much lumpier than their other products.  It requires a lot of chewing and seems a bit dry.
"I had purchased this item and their actual pizza mix too. I like this better for pizza. Haven't tried it for other things, but it makes a nice crust. Hubby even likes it and he is not GF. Very easy to make. Be careful, it is very fine and some blew out of the bowl when I had a window open!"
"I was overjoyed to find an organic black tea at a low price, and I assumed since it had the ""Newman's Own"" brand name on it, that it would be a great tea. I was disappointed. It was mild and rather tasteless. I understand that organic teas tend to be less brisk than non-organic, but I've ordered a favorite organic Assam from another well-known tea purveyor, and it was heads above this Newman blend. I got what I paid for with the Newman, but at least I'm not out a whole lot of money."
"Comes out soft and not hard as other brown rice products.  Can be used as sushi rice.  It is rice that may be difficult to find, so we are buying through here.  Wonderful!"
"These cookies were ok, just ok.  I may have been inclined to give them three stars had they arrived as whole cookies, every last cookies was broken.  I understand this is probably due to poor packaging.  The consistency was a bit grainy and dry though.  And milk did not help.  Next time I'll purchase a chewy brand or Mrs. Fields."
There was absolutly no scent or flavor to this.When I brought home truffles from Aosta in Italy they were wonderful and cost less. These were worthless.
"My dogs LOVE this.  Over many years and with many dogs I've tried every dog treat there is, and this one is rated 5 stars by my dogs.  They respond to it as if I'm giving them grilled steak.  It's miles ahead of any other treat including fatty pigs' ears.  If you want to treat your dog well, this product is IT."
"I couldn't wait to try the 8&#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake because it is made with fresh eggs, creamy sour cream, Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla and is topped and filled with cinnamon streusel. This 8&#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake is available online for only $18.95. Now, I have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes, but, let me just tell you that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake really ""takes the cake"" with size, price, quality and taste.<br />The cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition. It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top, before serving. I couldn't believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast, for three days. The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling. The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake. The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavor. Pair the cake with your morning coffee and you've got the perfect breakfast treat!"
"Just what I was looking for...  I'm not able to find this in the retail market.  I work all day and when I go to the gym, this product gives me the necessary staying power and doesn't give me the shakes like some of the other products."
The gravey is wonderful.  It taste just as good and the one from Scratch.  Except it is not as greasy
"This soil is unpredictable, except that it's definitely deadly if you add fertilizer during the first two months.  By unpredictable, I mean even without adding fertilizer, it may burn your plants due to hot spots in the soil, where the 6 months of time release nutrients come out all at once.<br /><br />Don't use this on prize garden stock without testing first.  You simply cannot control the nutrient uptake with this potting soil."
These are not the greatest.  Thought they would be great to have on hand when guest come.  Not so.  They were not what I had expected.
"My 22-year old son introduced us to this tea, which is quite refreshing. This powdered version has several virtues over the prepared version. It is much less expensive. It keeps much longer. My son says the taste is equal to or better than the prepared version (he makes it a bit stronger), and I like being able to make it a little weaker and less sweet. It mixes very easily with no powder remaining."
"This is the best peanut butter substitute I have ever had, and the chocolate version is perfect for low calorie desserts :o)"
I can no longer buy this in my area so was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  It is one of my favorite breath mints which I keep in various places around my home as well as in both of my cars.
"My labrador LOVES all the treats from Dogswell ! However, all of the Dogswell Jerky treats I have come across are Made In China. As a dog lover, I cannot knowingly give my dog a product from China. It does say ""cage-free"", but really? I'm not sure. BUT DOGSWELL Jerky Bars are Made in the USA & my dog loves this just as much! So bad news on the regular jerky, but upside: Dogswell has some USA products too!"
"Another hit from Coffee Masters.  Not overly oily like some flavored coffee companies make, but still the same flavor. Again, a pretty good sale, $18 for 4 bags of beans. Doesn't make as good an iced cup, but more than makes up for it with a normal brew. Smooth, creamy but not overpowering. Works out to 3# of coffee for $18, still a good deal for flavored coffee."
I've used others that are better.  If you're not careful you'll wind up with a lumpy sticky mess.  Try and mix this with the liquid prior to inserting it into the rice mixture.
"I am a person who has NEVER drank tea.  I've tried many different teas and have never liked any.  I also have moderate stomach issues so thought I'd try this tea.  I will admit it took me a couple cups of tea to get hooked, but once I did I found the taste wonderful and the calming effect on my stomach is a big help.  I drink one cup every night after dinner.  If I'm away from home I bring some tea bags with me."
"I wanted to love this because I LOVE Earl Grey tea, I NEED decaf and I ADORE the convenience of the Keurig.  Unfortunately, I don't love these.  The flavor is very weak and doesn't deliver on the aroma.  I typically use the large cup setting on the 3-size model, but even the small cup is wimpy with these.  I did find that mixing this one with a stronger-flavored decaf tea results in a more suitable strength, but then you have to make 2 cups of something. The English Breakfast decaf is a much better choice."
Was really bummed to find out that these chocolates had melted before they got to my daughter for her bday.  Seems that they should not be sold online if there is not a way to keep them 'safe'.  :-(
"I've always like Sugar-in-the-Raw but it is usually too expensive. Amazon has this priced very reasonably and I've been buying it regularly. I also try to avoid any food with hi-fructose corn syrup, and this sugar is what I like."
I have always made my own corn chowder and have been skeptical about store-bought.  BUT!! The Bar Harbor Corn Chowder is VERY TASTY!!<br />My husband (he likes to think of himself as a chowder connoisseur) enjoys it.<br />I use soy milk in it but cow's milk will make it richer.  Add a touch of butter and you're good to go!!
"The FDA has issued a warning about pet treats made in China.  You have to look for the small print on the back of the bag, but these are not made in the USA.  Please don't trust the health of your pets to Chinese-made treats.  I have personally lost a beloved pet.  I didn't know about the FDA warning.  Educate yourself before purchasing these."
"Altoids wintergreen mints were once my favorite flavor of altoids. They had a clean, refreshing, decidedly strong rush of pure mint flavor. For years I enjoyed the intense, clean sweet flavor, as I bit into them. Unfortunately, Wrigleys (the new owners) have altered the flavor (more artificial ingredients?) and added blue artificial color to them. The mints now taste like cheap toothpaste, that leaves an unpleasant chemical aftertaste in your mouth. These once delightful mints are now ghastly! Let's hope the Wrigley's people with the uneducated palates don't mess with the Peppermint Altoids!  I will not buy these wintergreen mints again, unless they change back to the old style, which was full of natural mint flavor, and artifical color free.  If you are lucky enough to find a tin that does not list ""color (blue 1)"" in the ingredients list, you've found some of the old style wintergreen mints (the good ones).  The full ingredients list on the original good wintergreen altoids was (sugar, natural and artificial flavors, gum arabic, gelatin).  Since I wrote this review I've been fortunate to find about a dozen boxes of the good, old mints.  These were at small out of the way grocery/drug stores that tend to charge a little more for their products.<br /><br />July, 2012: Well, it's been a year since I've been able to find a box of the good, old mints.  I broke down and bought a box of the new version today.  Wrigley's has added some of the natural flavor back to these mints, and they do taste slightly better.  However, they have left in the artificial color ""blue 1"", which negatively affects the flavor, and leaves  a bit of bitter aftertaste.  I won't buy them again.  I did buy 6 boxes of the Peppermint Altoids.  Thankfully, they are still the original formula, and as good as ever!"
"By the time these little rocks tell you that your plant needs water, your plant will be dead.  Great idea and just didn't pan out."
"I like this product, not bad taste at all plus good value.I like it.<br />Mailing is fast as well.: )satified with what i got."
this product comes from finland and is an all natural product that is always fresh and I have never tasted better licorice in my life.  This product arrived fast in a protective box and the price is great.  I will purchase another case now.
"This is a review for the Treat Wheel by Kyjen. This is my second product with them and will most likely be my last as the other one had some design flaws as well. Overall, the concepts seem to be good, but there's always one glaring flaw and cheap materials/construction. This treat wheel is a good idea: pull out the ""pegs"" and find the treat then use your nose to push the wheel around until you find a secondary treat in another chamber. However, the execution is anything but good. First, the pegs are in too deep and with little (except a dangerously small hole to snag a nail) to grip except super slippery plastic. I tried myself to push and pull the item out of place, and it wouldn't budge (not surprising since 3/4 of it is ""buried"") and my dogs just grew frustrated and quit. I thought of using it without the pegs and just as a spinner but all the chambers are connected, and the top portion is so badly attached to the bottom that it wobbles about instead of spinning smoothly around. Plus, the chambers are so slick (all the toy being made of that same super slippery plastic) that the treat just slides around. And forget durability. I've seen Dollar Store toys constructed better. A medium to large dog could break this thing in one sitting."
"Wow! Wow! What a great product. I am 70 and have been slow cooking steel-cut oatmeal for over 50 years. Now, that my 96 year old Mom is living with me and I am her caretaker, I have been looking for some nutritious short cuts and decided to give this a try. I was dubious because even some of my favorite brands like Trader Joe's Instant Oatmeal were dismal. This is the real McCoy. We both like chewy, filling hot cereal without a lot of sweet taste and this is simply delicious. One cup provides two servings - one for each of us. How thrifty is that! I still slow cook a quart of oatmeal 2x a month but am going to Subscribe & Save on this one regularly."
"I absolutely love poptarts even though they aren't the healthies breakfasts, I buy the low fat version and save half the fat of the regular version and I think they taste better, they are crispier when toasted.  The price is also right on amazon.com."
"We have two cats in our family. One will try just about anything the other one typically will only eat dry food.  My dry catfood eater could not get to the dish fast enough and he ate every last bite of it which is unusual for him.  My try anything cat also loved the food as well. It was a great treat for them.<br />Upon opening the can of food it smells like fresh fish, almost good enough to eat.<br />Try it, you and your cats will not be disappointed.  You won't have to worry about throwing any unused food away because they will lick the dish clean."
"Stale. The worst flavored, worst tasting walnuts that anyone ever tasted. They shouldn't even be on sale. Where is your quality assurance or quality control? I want my money back."
"These aren't as good as other bars of this type. My kids won't eat them, nor will my husband. They are all fond of the Nutrigrain variety, but I thought these would be a healthier alternative."
"Well I have tried many protein shakes and the taste is never been a problem for me but this was just horrible. It's GOOD for YOU but I just couldn't do it. It might be a good protein shake but it's extremely salty, i tried to drink it with other liquids to help the taste but every time it tasted worse and worse =( too bad because I was looking forwards to see some results!!"
These popchips are the best and they only have 100 calories per bag!  I can have a bag everyday they are so good.
"I got a popcorn maker for Christmas and after doing some research, I found this product. The key is the oil. Since than, I have ordered several boxes. It seems I always have popcorn on hand now. Once you try it, you will be sold."
"At first I wasn't sure how this would compare to my usual tea cabinet staple, Celestial Seasonings India Spice chai, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well it measured up. It has a spicy but pleasant aroma, and no harsh peppery taste like a lot of supermarket chais. Instead, there was a strong note of cinnamon with a hint of ginger, so if you like either of those ingredients, you would probably enjoy this. Unfortunately, as others point out, it is no longer available in leading grocery stores, so you will have to buy it here."
"I bought these without first doing some research. I was giving these to my dog for a few days, her breath was great and I felt good that her teeth were also being cleaned aside from brushing. I noticed she was getting diarrhea didnt really think it was the greenies until I did research and found alot of dogs have digestive issues over this stuff and some small dogs have even died. My dog is 60lbs not small but it was affecting her stomach. I stopped for a week and her stool was back to normal. The other day I gave her one greenie to see how she would react and 12hrs later the diarrhea is back. She had it all day yesterday and some this morning, hopefully tomorrow it is all gone but these greenies are now in the garbage and I am in search of other dental chews."
"They didn't honor price listed and when I called and sent several emails to complain they stated it was a computer ""glitch"" and proceeded to refund my money. A WEEK before Valentines Day. I was sending over six orders and they ROYALLY screwed me and did not have enough customer service experience to honor the price it sold for. I will NEVER order from this company EVER again!"
"OK, you may have tried the regular Shirataki noodles.  They have a texture nothing like a noodle.<br /><br />These Tofu noodles are excellent!!  I purchased them and have used them with tomato sauce, Asian dressing in a cold noodle salad, and also in a fritata with eggs and sauteed veggies.<br /><br />Just rinse under cold water for 2-3 minutes, then microwave for 2 minutes, pat dry and go for it.<br /><br />Amazing!"
"For a microwavable chili, this stuff, and the firehouse variant, do taste good. However, I never get to eat the full container because it tends to explode in the microwave. I've followed the directions exactly on the label, as well as tried some tweaking, and nothing so far has prevented it from exploding.<br /><br />The problem is the plastic lid that is to be left on. It is left on because it is vented but covers the chili to keep it from splattering. Irony is there is not enough venting, the chili plugs the holes, and as it boils and water vapor expands, it basically becomes a messy bomb in your microwave.<br /><br />I wish I could say it was user error and that there is a way to enjoy this without the mess. So far the firehouse variant hasn't exploded on me, but it also has less meat and beans to it. Since the firehouse variant is not really all that spicy, I may just stick with that until Campbells can make this not a bomb."
This is a great way to buy coffee especially when the local grocery stores are of no help to the consumer.
I just had one of these bars today and I got to tell you it was good. Kind of like an Almond Joy candy bar w/o the almonds but awesome good. I am planning to buy some of these bars along with some of their other products.You will not be dissatisfied.
"We ordered this candy for the color without tasting it for my daughter's wedding reception candy bar.  It was among the favorites.  It is not too sweet and not too tart--just right.  Due to huge popularity in my office, I have since reordered it to restock the candy jar.  It seems to be universally enjoyed."
I purchased this food coloring hoping it would create black frosting. I read several reviews on this and other websites which suggested I use chocolate icing (as white icing + black food coloring= gray frosting) but this product did not darken the chocolate at ALL. I ended up using over half for one cake and still decided the color wasn't right. It was still obviously brown. Perhaps my expectations were too high.
"This is absolutelty the best ""instant"" hot chocolate we've ever had! Put some whipped cream in it to make it even better."
Very good lemony flavor.  Amazing how good this tea is without having to be seeped for several minutes.  I recommend.
"I bought these for my husband because he occassionally likes a cup of coffee at home and it is a hassle to drag out the coffee maker and grinder when he only wants one cup and it's not everyday.  It also comes in handy when guests come over, because we don't tend to keep coffee in the house.<br /><br />Each serving comes in a little pouch that you can easily slip into your pocket, briefcase or travel bag.  The flavor was rich and at around $1.00 a cup, much cheaper than going to Starbucks or anywhere else and grabbing a cup on the way to work.<br /><br />It dissolves completely leaving no grit or residue.  He first tried it in a 12 ounce mug and found it to be a little strong, but was perfect in his 20 ounce travel mug.<br /><br />[...]"
"Great product and great scheduled deliveries.  I get it for my youngest son, who lives in a group home. Not sure what they do with it all, but at least he's clean!"
"i was shopping for SUGAR-FREE cookies, so they suggested other SUGAR-FREE cookies and i selected them, unfortunately, i'm a diabetic, and when i received the ""lucy"" chocolate chip cookies: NOT only were they assorted flavors (Which i DIDNT order) BUT they were NOT SUGAR-FREE!! why would they suggest these i have NO idea,but i'm very upset."
too much MSG gives it a nasty salty after taste.  i basically gave them away.
"It is not what I thought it would be.  I expected more chocolatey, so I was disappointed.  Other Tassimo coffees are very good, so I won't let this keep me from ordering others.  I especially like the Kona blend."
Food is very much a personal preference but I really don't like any of these crackers made by this company. They taste like flavored paper. Someone said better than nothing but I'd rather have something else.
"I bought this because I wanted to try the Wild Blueberry and the Hazelnut Dark Roast.  I really liked the Wild Blueberry (which is really yummy!), but this pack doesn't contain the Dark Hazelnut - it's the regular Hazelnut which is ok but a major letdown.  The Caramel Vanilla is really good, so is the French Vanilla.  It would be better if they would replace the French Vanilla with a different sample though, to give a wider variety of samples."
This is quite the buy compared to other hot chocolates. The kids love it quick and easy.I will order this hot chocolate again.
"I consider myself a big fan of both Reese's and Whoppers so I was excited when I saw this new product.  However, after going through one box over a few days, I find this to be a major disappointment.  The product is very waxy and doesn't have enough peanut butter taste (package says ""Peanut Butter Flavored"" which should have been a red flag to begin with).  Maybe this product could be improved if the company 1) adds real peanut butter and 2) tries a double-layer coating of chocolate and peanut butter since this is the winning combination for the famous Reese's peanut butter cups."
"I agree that this is a great alternative to those other ""instant noodle soups."" I definitely prefer Annie Chun's Soup Bowls to the greasy and overly salted take out around my college campus. However, other than it being better than the other choices I have, it's not that traditional and the tastes are a bit too strong for my liking. I will try to put in less seasoning but I doubt it'll taste anything like my dad's pho. I'd recommend it though for those looking for a ""healthier"" alternative to ramen."
"My Tibetin Terrior is 3 years old and has been on Wellness food since birth.  I just recently found Newman's Own Organics.<br />The price was a bit cheaper, plus free shipping to my home!  AWESOME!  When I started to gradually change foods.  My LIVI,<br />would eat only the Newmans' and leave the Wellness to later when she was really hungry.  So Funny!  She is the ""queen"" and she knows it!!"
This is a great Dental Chew that my dog loves so much and it is very healthy for him.
"Greenies are a healthy treat for dogs and they love them!  I first bought them while working at a hardware/feed store to give them a try. We were so pleased to find them on Amazon at nearly half the price.  Every dog owner should try them, they come in all sizes for all dogs and really do keep their teeth in great condition."
"the one i got says ""cleanse"" on the box, I don't know what it means, but I know that I picked the one that doesn't say ""cleanse"" on the box. i'm all the more angry because that one costs way cheaper. and all the more am i angry because i'm not going to bother to go through the refund process. plus it took it ages to arrive"
"I wish more companies were as good as Newman's Own. You feel like you are getting quality food at a good price. That's why I jumped at getting these for my dog when I heard about them.<br /><br />They are the same consistency as ""Milk Bones"" maybe a little denser. They come in around 1""x 2""x 1/4"", they can be easily broken in two because of a seam in the middle. I have a minature Maltese and they are kind of big for him but I just break it into quarters for him which is a little hard to do but it can be done.<br /><br />He seems to enjoy eating them and I know they are better than most of the stuff out there since they are made by a company with such high standards for food."
"For a sweet after dinner treat, try this with a little milk and honey.  Ummm!"
"I recently found I that I have an allergy to gluten products. I wasn't really a fan of the products I found on my local groceries shelf, I thought I would give this a try. They taste pretty good, not as good as the normal every day kind you get off the shelf. Be careful not to overcook them as they can be dry. I made these with dairy free white chocolate chips and another batch with walnuts mmm did they taste good! I would buy again as Amazon is the best price I have found it!"
"This coffee is great, don't buy it here, though.  Your local grocery store will have it for much less and your local Sam's club will have it for less than $13."
"Jamaica Me Crazy has a slight overtone of cinnamon that is a very nice compliment to the taste of coffee.  The flavoring is strong enough to taste, not just smell, without overpowering the flavor of the coffee.  Very good."
"My baby LOVES his chicken, and he prefers it in this type of food pouch. It is easy to heat up and nice that it came in a timely manner"
My dog has still not figured out what to do with this.  He is a very smart dog with a vocab of about 50 words.  I was surprised how hard the plastic is and am also worried.  Once he does figure out how it works I am afraid he will knock himself out when he shakes it from side to side! Let alone what will happen if it flies out of his mouth!
"We use this bread mix for our main gluten-free bread at home.  Everyone loves it.  Plus, we have an egg allergy and so I make it egg-free and it is still very good."
"This is an awesome product.  use generously for maximum effect,  tastes just like the gourmet popcorn you pay $5 a bag for.  Please buy this so they keep making it.  Thanks."
"These are good chips! Maybe not as tasty as some other unhealthy chips, but I would definitely buy them again."
these are only half the size of the pixy stix I ordered 6 mos ago.  1/2 ounce each. That translates into a heck of a price increase.
"A friend sent me two boxes of this for Christmas.  I thought it an odd gift, as I can just go out and buy herbal tea.  Shortly thereafter, I was flung into major stress and chaos during an extreme family crisis. I started drinking this tea to help with unexpected stomach pains and it worked!  Not only that, during this time, other family members got physically ill, but I was able to carry on without catching the bug.  Since then, I'm a believer.  I make this as iced tea for daytime and drink a cup at night before bed."
I loved cheese crackers as a kid in the 1940s and 1950s.  They changed them and I hadn't had a good cheese cracker for years and years.  Then I discovered Back to Nature Crispy Cheddars Crackers.  I'm hooked.
"I am making the swich from other no calorie sweeteners and bought this to use in my coffee in the morning. They recomend 6 drops as a serving and I find this to sweet so use 4 for a large cup of coffee and find it is just right! At first I found all stevia products to be a little bitter after taste but after using for a couple of weeks I am now used to it, so if you want to make the swich, just think of it as good for you and try to get used to it. It is worth the effort and you will be doing your body good!"
These Macaroons taste fantastic; but they are not raw. Hail Merry is advertising this product as raw and it isn't. Out of six ingredients only two are raw. The Coconut oil and sea salt are the only raw ingredients in this product. See back of package for Details.
"There is nothing ""extra bold,"" or even ""regular bold"" about this coffee.  On the other hand, if you like your coffee meek and weak, you may well like this.  This comment isn't meant to suggest that my tastes are superior, I'm just stating that this is not ""extra bold"" at all.  If you want your coffee ""slap your face"" strong, try another Green Mountain flavor.  Dark magic, for example."
"Our dog LOVES these, but we only use them in the everlasting treat balls- worth the money if you have a chewer!  They last forever if they are inserted into the everlasting ball because only the end sticks out- perfect to entice them to chew the toy :)"
"This review is specifically geared towards the new Nong Shim bowl design...<br /><br />I live in MA, and my local Shaw's only stocks the new plastic bowls of Nong Shim now, no longer the Styrofoam kind, most people are used to.<br /><br />There are two very different things to consider here.<br /><br />No. 1, the bowls are deeper and hold more volume (i.e. water), meaning they aren't as spicy if you fill it to the top.  If you enjoyed their age-old flavor don't fill the bowl all the way to the top.<br /><br />The second difference is that these bowls no longer insulate, so please be careful after adding boiling water.  WARNING: they are hot.  It's a design flaw in order to make the bowls recyclable/microwavable.<br /><br />The tradeoff is that they can be microwaved now.  The lids are different as well.  They don't have the same lining as before, but create a nice seal if you simply place a spoon over them for the three minutes after adding boiling water.<br /><br />I have yet to microwave a batch--it seems useless if you have a stove, so just be aware of the new design next time you go to enjoy a bowl."
"These belts are so good! I am eating one as I write this review. They are soft and extremely sour (but not too sour). I also like that they come individually wrapped in high-quality plastic. This product comes with 150 pieces and weighs 3lbs 4.90z, so as far as I can tell, we are only paying a slight premium for the individual wrappers."
"I have two Australian Cattle Dogs VERY high energy breeds, I have tried all foods from solid gold to Canidae and have had mixed results with both of those foods,I have tried the regular Royal Canin medium breed and both of my medium sized dogs (50 lbs) seem to like the puppy food. There waste deposits seem to have gone down and there coats and behaviors have never been better (both on royal canin for 2 years), no vet bills, beautiful coats and best of all the dogs attitudes have never been better."
"I've purchased dozens of bags of this pancake mix (which is a great product, by the way).  This is the highest price I've seen.  Whole Foods carries this item and it's been on sale there for $9.99 (that's Canadian dollars, too, as I'm in Canada).  It's even cheaper on Baker's Box's own website, and they're the company selling this product through Amazon. For a two-pack they should be charging $20 or less.  What gives?  I thought Amazon was where you could find competitive prices."
"Good chocolate and a lot of it, and quite a unique item.  If you're a chocolate lover and need a huge fix, or want a great gift for a loved one, this is what you want!<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who's not on a diet... :^)"
"I have a different Keurig model at home and I absolutely love it. I would always make myself a cup of coffee first thing in in the morning and bring it with me to work.<br /><br />When I saw this model in a store, on sale for $80 I could not resist the temptation to buy one. I have kept this model at my desk for about a year and have zero regrets. Makes the perfect cup of coffee every time, and I get it fresh no matter when I want it."
it like drinking a energy drink without the sugar. cant wait till it ready to ship again it must be pretty popular becaus even green mountain coffe dont have any
Cost was $48 at time of review.  Only $25 at other sites .... buy elsewhere!  Sometimes prime is worth paying an extra dollar or two. I will be comparison shopping a little more now.
"That's the one and only ingredient in this oatmeal.  No sugar. No salt. nNo preservatives or ""natural flavors"".  No food dyes - none of that.  Just whole grain goodness.  Cooks up in just a few minutes. I love this oatmeal!"
"We have been purchasing this product for several months and have enjoyed it in the past, but this order is inferior.  Did the company change hands or outsource their production?"
"I was excited to see this 50 pack of coffee! Read all about how ""if you like Dunkin Donuts, you'll love this"".  Well its not good at all.  Comes out looking like tea. Has the flavor of coffee but its really just water.  Trust me, I am not a fan of the ""Rocket Fuel"" they serve at Starbucks but this is nothing like Dunkin.  Just cancelled subscription."
"I'm sitting here, (Switch) drink in hand, trying to decide how to describe the Switch Kiwi Berry. It's lightly carbonated, which I like but too sweet for my taste (think strawberry candy). The mouth feel is quite round and it has some body too it. It's made from juice concentrates and carbonated water and there are 135 calories of sugar in the small 8 oz can. I wouldn't call it a healthy beverage and whether it's natural or not doesn't matter to me."
"This candy was obviously old. Each chocolate was discolored. The Krackel krispies were not crispy and the chocolate wasn't right. Peant butter cups and Goodbars nasty, the nuts are horrible. Hersheys pulls their candy off of the shelves in the stores when it is getting old. Seller must have bought it up & sold it here last year or the year before. It has to be at least 1 or more years old. Do not buy chocolate from ZANY Values, it isn't good for you!!<br /><br />I'm sure that if the candy were FRESH that it would have been just fine. I have re-ordered from a different vendor and will let you know if theirs is fresh (as it should be) or not."
The taste of this almond milk is so off that I cannot even finish the carton that I purchased. I prefer Blue Diamond original Almond milk
"I expected that these canisters of Blue Diamond ""Roasted Almonds - Honey"" would be the same product as the little cans of Blue Diamond ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" ( <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSZ5PW"">Blue Diamond Almonds Honey Roast, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a> ) but they're surprisingly not the same, and have a very ""off"" taste.  What a disappointment!  Blue Diamond has apparently seen fit to add much more maltodextrin and ""other natural flavors"", which I suspect cause the odd taste, thus ruining a fabulous product.<br /><br />I've been having a hard time finding the small cans of Blue Diamond ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" at the supermarkets, despite all the other flavors being carried.  It's as if Blue Diamond just, for some reason, *wants* this product to fail.  First they make it hard to get the canned version, then they completely change the taste of a great product and package it in a canister, using a name that is so similar that it contains all the same words, but without a hint that it's not the same product.<br /><br />I'd contact Blue Diamond and complain, but I already know that they never respond to customers despite having a contact link on their website.  In the past, I wrote to them when they test-marketed and then removed some wonderful silvered almonds (not ""slivered"" but silvered, as in almonds with a very light sugary coating);  when I wrote to ask, instead of appreciating my interest as a customer, they simply ignored me.<br /><br />So I'm offering this review as a warning to anyone else who might make the same mistake, and think that these almonds will be like the similarly-named canned ""Honey Roasted Almonds"" from the same company.  The ones in the can are great;  these are just plain awful, and I'll be throwing out 2.9 canisters of 3 purchased."
The taste is not real great and the protein level is really low.  I definitely prefer Amazing Grass Green Superfood Chocolate to this product.
"For the longest time, I made microwave popcorn. Never again. When I first ventured into popping my own, I bought a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004RC6R"">West Bend 82306 Stir Crazy 6-Quart Electric Popcorn Popper</a>. I then went to the store and bought some popcorn oil and some kernels. I was so disappointed when I had it.<br /><br />Then a friend recommended this popcorn to me, and I absolutely love it. I've bought two boxes so far from Amazon. It tastes as close to anything I've ever had to movie popcorn (minus the butter).<br /><br />A few suggestions if you use this with the Stir Crazy.<br /><br />- If you use a Stir Crazy, the 4 oz. packs will fill it up perfectly.<br />- Separate kernels on both sides of the rod in the middle, and distribute the oil in 2 portions on either side also.<br />- Enjoy!<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />+ All ingredients in 1 pack.<br /><br />+ Tastes incredible.<br /><br />+ You can use as much or as little butter salt as you want.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- Coconut oil is a bit sticky when you squeeze it out of the pack.<br /><br />Overall, highly recommended."
This is a great product. My dogs love them. In fact they will fight over who gets one first. The teenies are the perfect size. It is one of the few treats I can safely offer my smallest yorkie. They both seem to listen very well when I pull out the bag.<br /><br />My vet says that for yorkies they both have very little plague. It beats trying to use the small brushes to brush their teeth.
This is the best white tea I have ever had. Tried other Lipton flavors but this one has them all beat..Teenagers love it too.
That is why he brought this down from the heavens for us mere mortals to taste.<br /><br />There's only 2 Cereals that the we've truly been blessed with. 1. Lucky Charms 2. Cinnamon Toast Crunch. I'd throw Fruitloops in there but that's a man made attempt at creating a God given cereal.
"My 3 yr old 75lb boxer is a heavy chewer and has a really long attention span to toys that give him a challenge. So at first this seemed like a promising toy.  It lasted maybe one week before my boxer figured out that picking it up in his mouth then dropping, no slamming, it on my hardwood floor gets pieces of food out. The end cap, which screws on and is plastic, never stood a chance. it broke off and I was able to screw it on once more before bits of plastic shards were on my floor and victory was his.<br /><br />It now sadly sits in the dogs toy box he doesnt like it anymore now that it doesnt dispense treats. lol. I wish I could get my money back or get a new plastic screw cap for it."
"I have a two-year old Jack Russell Terrier and she loves Newman's Own Dog Food! She ate Beneful for a year before switching. This goes down much easier. She doesn't each eat it ""just because she's hungry""; she actually likes it! I highly recommend this product and would consider giving any dog nothing less!"
"I must be the odd man out here...but this powdered goat milk is horrible!  My 18 month old son is allergic to dairy and soy, hence the reason for goat milk.  We were going on vacation for two weeks, and I was afraid there would not be any source of goat milk at that destination. Being he drinks almost a quart a day of regular liquid goat milk I purchase from Trader Joe's, I figured I would go for the gusto and buy a two weeks supply for him. It smelled horrible and more importantly tasted horrible! Words cannot even describe how disgusting this stuff was.  My poor son almost threw up from tasting it which prompted me to smell it.  It smelled so bad, I couldn't even taste it myself.  Maybe we're just used to the regular brand he drinks?  My only advice, try a small amount first.  It is not returnable!!!"
"I have four dogs, two males and two females, of the Heinz 57 variety, all sizes and shapes, and they LOVE these treats!  Since this was something new, they were of course a little hesitant at first, but after eating just one they caught on really fast and all begged for more.  As I removed each treat from the bag, I had each dog's most rapt and focused attention.  I like the ingredients, nothing fancy, just good stuff for dogs.  I will be buying these again."
"Sorry to all you champurrado fans, this is not the real deal, but an artificial version, and WAY too sweet. Please compare to others 'hecho en Mexico', and get yourself a 'molinillo' while you're at it! ps: I use almond milk to make mine!"
"I was sorely disappointed in these cookies.. They are pretty tasteless and damn hard too.. I wouldn't buy them again and I've certainly tasted much better low-cal cookies.. I definitely recommend saving your money, folks.."
"I used this oil for a few years now for almost every recipe. It bakes really good in breads and it smells nice, and good in salads. Highly recommended."
"In my opinion, its an outrage that these treats which used to be Made in the US are now Made in China. The company did not advertize anywhere about this and we only found out accidentally while looking at the wrap for ingredients.<br /><br />Let me start my review stating that many of the current 5-star ratings here look suspiciously fake (made up). Its hard to imagine anyone writing something positive about them unless they fail to see reviews clearly warning buyers about these treats being Made in China. Hard to blame Chinese to manufacture them but its Dogwells fault for not realizing dangers of making them there with their poor record in food manufacturing from the past with food poisoning in pet food."
I drink this delicious tea almost every day.  I have yet to find anything like it on the market.
"I have used Lavender Essential Oil for years and loved the idea that these were food grade.  I ordered 7 different oils about a month ago - at the time of this purchase - but have only received 5.<br /><br />First the oils: They are mostly comparable to other brands but seem a thinner and do not seem to last as long as others - I expect that is due to the food grade. The bottles do not come with droppers - this makes it difficult to use as everything with essential oils is based on drops.  Depending on how often I actually use in food - I may or may not purchase this brand of lavender again.  The price is good but if I have to buy my own dropper tops it outweighs the better price.<br /><br />The company - faerie's finest - I was okay with the delay I was informed of on two of the oils in this purchase; however, when I recently emailed them to find out when those two oils would arrive I was informed that they were supposedly mailed before the date I was told there would be a delay.  When the issue is resolved - I will update this review.  In the interim, I will not recommend the seller nor will I buy from them again.  Which is unfortunate as they have nice selection of essential oils."
"Tender / very few left-over kernels / Cheese coating adheared to the popcorn..  Absolutely Yummy ;)  Reminded me of ""Cheetos"" & will recommend this product to ALL Cheese Lovers !!!"
"If you like cheese seasoning on your popcorn, this product will not deliver.  It tastes like they should instead of putting anything cheese related on the label they should say, 'improved salt flavoring that will stick to popcorn more than salt'.  I would recommend anything by Kernal Season's brand... that tastes like cheese.  But if you like a salty tasting popcorn, this is the seasoning for you..."
"I enjoy the nice tang in this mayo, made coleslaw with it and it was much better than the usual brands."
"I expected better from a premium Maine chowder. This is no better than, say, Snow's, which you can get for less than half the price. Not bad, but not worth the money."
"I bought this toy and put one of my dogs in her crate with it.  I just filled it with a handful of kibble.  1/2 hour later the Tug a Jug was broken.  My dog had chewed the end off where it screws on.  Her chewing destroyed the threads so the toy is useless. She's a 55 pound food motivated dog, medium chewer.  My original worry about the Tug a Jug was that it would be noisy on hard floors.  It never made it that far.  I had better luck with the Busy Bone toy, although she can get the Gnawhide rings off pretty quick. At least that one is still usable."
This lands in the gormet category for sure.  Having these pancakes is like going to a resturant and having exceptional pancakes that you would expect to get at home.  The price is a bit high but you know that before you buy them so its not fair to downgrade the product bnecause of that.<br /><br />They cook up nicely and one pack of two goes a long time.
Item is delicious.  Arrived early.  Packaging was ample.  Candy was extremely fresh and size was exactly as shown.  Item is a little pricy but well worth the expense.
I love fact that this drink is neither too tangy or tos sweet.The combimation of both is perfect and therefore quenches yor thirst  without leaving an unpleant after taste. t
"I adore sardines.  I'm used to the Bela brand, but decided to try these for variety's sake.  I opened up a can and it smelled like nasty cat food.  I tasted them anyway, but was totally grossed out.  In the trash it went.  Stick with Bela, super clean flavor, fresh and better sourced.  Totally different food product.  Try them with Siracha."
"A little while back, Newmans Own Tea was on sale and we have enjoyed all the other products under the brand name and appreciate the fact that proceeds benefit charities! The tea is phenomenal~ has far less bitterness than others, has a mellow flavor, lovely hue,whether your preference is to have it plain, with milk, with sugar,lemon or orange wedges, iced, or with a few oz. of pomegranate juice. I am not at all uncomfortable with having 6 boxes of 100 bags in my house for my husband and I and guests....my sister-in-law just decided she thinks it's the best there is and I gifted her with a box!There's no chance of it lasting long around here. It would also make a great Christmas gift with a lovely antique tea cup and old fashioned sugar cubes!"
"I love these bacon curls or pork rinds as some call them. I was so happy to find them again. Easy, delicious and high protein snack --- I eat them every night watchng tv. Never had a bag that didn't perform well........LOVE THEM!!!!!"
I have been trying many different brands and types of maple syrup because my family loves homemade waffles and pancakes and Coombs Organic Grade B is the best so far. The Grade B has a richer flavor than Grade A. It may be a little pricey but keep in mind that it lacks all of the chemicals and additives. It's just pure maple syrup!
"Normally I buy the Fruztio Freeze Dried Apricots made by Crispy Green Co. and they are DELICIOUS- but the store I was getting them from was out of stock for a very long time. So, I decided to try the cantaloupe since I like fresh cantaloupe...how bad could they be?<br />My only choice was a large multi-pack bag, so I forked up the money with high hopes.  I tore into the bag, appreciating the single serve sized bags inside. I opened one up and took a bite. Blech! yuck! These tasted like green, under-ripe canteloupe! I was hoping for that super sweet-I could eat this whole melon- sort of flavor....but no.<br />These were so bad that I threw the whole multi-pack away, and that's saying A LOT, because I'm very frugal with my food purchases. I just knew I would NEVER eat the rest of them. Wish I could give a better review, but i can't.<br />But I do recommend the apricots that I mentioned....they are super flavorful and delicious if you love that tart apricot flavor!"
I like the size & Angel loves the taste!  She likes to eat when we do & the Itty Bitty Bones satisfy her participation without affecting her appetite at her regular mealtime.  I LOVE knowing the products are safe and USA made.  Have just subscribed to monthly deliveries of this product.
"I really like this coffee but,I'll be dammed if I'm going to pay $91.8 cents a cup<br />just to support GM's stock price.I hope whatever they're smoking over in corporate<br />is worth it.."
"I've had these several times-they're very good brownies.  They have a good texture (gluten free can mean gritty, but these are fine).  They're very chocolaty, not overly sweet."
"Working odd hours I'm always looking for the latest/greatest energy drink that doesn't make me crash and actually does it's job.  I'm not a coffee drinker so these energy drinks are my only saving grace.  Having had the others out there, I loved the increased alertness I had after drinking Energy 2000 and it seems to last for over six hours.  It makes sense since according to the label it has 25% more ""energy"" than it's counterpart energy shot.  So it lasts longer AND it costs less?  Count me in!"
I thought this would be a easy way to get a quick dinner for the baby & for babies used to eating processed food this may work but my granddaughter will not eat more than 2-3 bites before she turns up her nose and shakes her head no.  I have found it much easier to just cook her small amount of veggies and cut up cooked chicken that she can finger feed herself and she is much happier.
"Ok Folks - listen up. For special occasions, we'll spend the big bucks and get a rack of lamb.  You're lucky today if you can even find it in the stores - it's so expensive - often at $20-40 per pound.  So, the very last thing you want to do, after spending all that money, is ruin it with the wrong flavoring. Colorado Spices, New Zealand Lamb Rub has the right blend of herbs that goes well on just about any meat.  We just used it on some fresh bluefin and yellowfin tuna and it was FANTASTIC. My 88 year old Mother, who cooks every day and is not a huge spice fan (she's used to plain, New England cooking) loves and uses the rub on chicken, lamb, and fish.  She's having me order another case and loves the individual packets - as the rub does not lose its taste or flavor and stays fresh.  This is a great product!"
This soup is very very sweet.  They left out the salt but it is full of sugar.  There is 14 grams of sugar per serving with two servings in a can.  Too sweet for me.  Also there is dairy butter in it so it is not vegan or for someone with dairy allergies.
"got the wish pearl as a gift. My daughter thought it was a ""little disgusting "" the mollusk and the necklace  to hold the pearl was cheaply made so it wasa struggle to open it.  (we still haven't gotten it open)  We live at the ocean so my daughter is not sqirmish around sea creatures but didn't really enjoy this gift."
"We are big fans of the Passion Fruit Tea but wanted to try something different. I like all of the flavors but the blackberry is my fave for a change of pace, still got to have the passion fruit as the go to tea though. Everyone raves about how good this stuff is. I can't make enough."
Nice and thick the way pizza sauce should be - not a watery mess the way the rest of them are. Good stuff full of flavor.
"This ""Baby White"" popcorn pops small and somewhat hard.  I have tried several batches with various adjustments of heat, using a ""whirlypop"" popcorn popper.  Unsatisfactory results!  I won't purchase this again."
"Using the SproutMaster I've had great success with these, full trays of sprouts effortlessly. One container will produce a massive amount of sprouts.<br /><br />If you don't know much about this kind of sprout, beans and peas are a good source of vegetarian protein. Sprouts, as they grow produce enzymes, which can play a number of roles in digestion and even immune system function, because most of your immune system is in your gestational tract. Sprouts are also a great source of fiber, and antioxidants. During the winter it is great to be able to grow a fresh, live food, because veggies at the grocery store are usually quite wilted or picked well before their peak. Sprouts, eaten fresh, are a plant that on a per-size basis, is pretty much the most potent and healthy thing you can feed yourself."
The nuts were stale and tastless. I tried to get a refund but you said it could not be refunded. I threw them out.
"These chips taste great! You will not go wrong with them they are low in calories high in fiber. If you eat to much like more than one bag in a sitting, you may become constipated! other than that they are wonderful you will not be sorry."
"My dog loves these things more than any other treat we've ever bought her, but they are pricey.  This supplier sells them for half what the pet chains do and shipping is free."
tastes like dry brownie w/ invisible pieces of puffed rice which get stuck in your teeth. come on. we can do better than this for cookie bars.
I agonized over what to put in my five year old's lunch.  I know she will actually eat these and they have a good amount of fiber (and even protein)!
"Nice flavor and great value.  I roast using a Behmoor 1600 and it turns out great!  I have had several other types of beans from these guys and all were tasty, arrived on time and worth the money!  I have bought from others who also sent tasty beans, but the value from these guys can't be beat."
This product was very good when I began buying it but lately it is terrible. There is no taste at all. That's the reason I no longer purchase this item. Thank you.
"I was attracted to these because they have more fiber than most, along with more protein. I think they taste great!"
"If you are going to eat potatoes, go organic and the real thing...not in a can. Big mistake. I like some canned foods but potatoes are a few miles away where you can get the real thing, cheap."
"I purchased this product based on my research on the internet and the reviews on Amazon regarding this product's lack of aftertaste, low glycemic response, and mainly because people stated it had no gastric effects as Xylitol does.  I used it this morning in a banana bread recipe.  This afternoon I began paying the price and a few minutes later everybody near me began paying the price with me.  This impacted my gut exactly the way all sugar alcohols do.  I'll be passing this item on to my sister with diabetes.  Her meds already tear up her gut so she probably won't notice as much.  Back to the drawing board for me."
"This popcorn has a good taste like the movies theaters at a reasonable price. The package contains all of the ingredients and instructions to a good eating and popping experience.<br />Although I didn't got through the whole case I bought,family and friends loved it. Nice product I'll buy from Discount Tommy soon!<br /><br />  Marcla"
Saw These Treats On Site Thought Would Try Dogs Love Them Will Be Purchasing More
I buy K-cups all the time and it was nice to buy a double pack for less money than I would have paid in the store. The breakfast blend is not a bold coffee. Being rather mellow and not bitter and with no after taste. If you are looking for a mild tasting coffee this would be a good choice.
"Good flavorful chips - too bad the selection does not include jalape&ntilde;o or paramsan garlic. Packaging is difficult to open, but they fresh."
This stuff tastes like the pink soap in a a gas station bathroom smells.<br /><br />Yuck.<br /><br />I threw the whole bottle away after two tastes.  I only took the second taste to see if it really tasted as bad as it did.
This sauce is excellent for authentic Chinese dishes! My wife is from China and we love to use this product to make Hot Pot and Ma Po Tofu.
"My Maltese absolutely LOVES anything that Exclusively Pets makes. But if you really want to train your pet, give him or her a cheese treat! The greatest thing about their products is that they smell exactly like whatever the package says. The cheese treats smell like Cheez It! The carob cookie treats smell like chocolate chip cookies... So forth and so on. I used to buy these locally but saved buying them online."
"OK, I can't stand these things, but my babies love them, so I gave it 2 stars, not one. First of all, it's just puffed corn, like Peanut Puffs, if you've had those by Envirokids. And that wouldn't be so bad if they didn't taste like you were licking a cinnamon stick or putting a teaspoon of ground spice in  your mouth. For being ""all natural"" it sure does pack an unpleasant wallop! Watch out! Maybe the Honey Nut is better..."
"I bought the popchips variety pack to try the different flavors and I kept an open mind but I just don't like this flavor.  Their other flavors like BBQ & salt and vinegar are great, but these are REALLY peppery.  I can't even taste the salt on them because the pepper is so overwhelming.  Might be your bag of tea if you like a lot of pepper on food, but my husband puts pepper on everything and even he said there was too much pepper here."
"I bought this with the expectation of receiving exactly what is shown in the picture.  Obviously, that doesn't happen (like most tragic marketing schemes).  The plant arrived with 6 TINY traps of which 3 were in dormancy (fully black and dried out - but hey I live in VA so it's cold here).  So you can imagine I was somewhat disappointed at first.  Then I stuck with it and kept raising it for 3 weeks.  New traps grew and the plant seems to be doing fairly well.  The traps are also looking bigger.<br /><br />I would recommend this purchase, but buyers should not expect a PERFECT plant to arrive."
"The AmeriColor AmeriMist Edible Paint and Airbrush Color Gold Sheen worked great with my airbrush or you can just spray it on. Awesome color, just as in the photos."
"I bought these for my wife for her birthday, she LOVES chocolate and its a staple gift I give her. Well this year I got her these. She only ate one, and put them away. Very strange. Later I caught her putting them in the garbage. When I tried one I quickly realized why, they taste like they have no sugar in them, and leave an aftertaste that reminded me of badly burnt toast. I had to brush my teeth to get the taste out. We had a good laugh about it. Fortunately I also gave her a necklace which she really did love so they didn't ruin her birthday. 43 dollars wasted."
"I don't eat eggs, so oatmeal is my warm comfort food of choice for breakfast.  Maple Brown Sugar is one of my ""go to"" flavors - it disappears from the variety pack first and it's the one I seek out at the store (along with apple).  I'm also big on cutting costs at the grocery store, so I avoid name brands that aren't truly worth the extra money.  So, the important thing for me is how this oatmeal compares to the cheap stuff.<br /><br />There really is no comparison.  The store brands are a real disappointment.  The oats don't absorb the water properly.  The flavoring doesn't dissolve.  The texture is like someone threw confetti in hot water that was used to boil okra.  The taste is the cloying side.  On the other hand, Quaker absorbs the water, the flavoring dissolves, the texture is nicely bumpy and three-dimensional, and the brown sugar is just enough.<br /><br />Don't go cheap on oatmeal or you'll be sorry.  If you want to save a buck on your oatmeal, buy the real stuff in bulk on Amazon."
"I'm not sure most American coffee drinkers would go for this. I tried it several times at varying strengths, and even using half what I normally use, it tasted way too strong and burnt. It has very little complexity--whatever is there is drowned in the harsh burnt taste that reminds me of mud for some reason. I don't have an issue with regular coffee though I did once have trouble with acid reflux; I didn't notice much difference in acidity levels and the sheer overwhelming strength of the coffee gave me a stomachache that normal coffee doesn't.<br /><br />I understand that some foreign drinkers might like this and suspect that's the market the manufacturer is going for. I gave two stars because some people might actually really like that strong taste in their coffee. I don't think it's bad coffee, just really really strong. It makes me wonder what their normal roasts and blends might taste like."
"thesedon't like hot food they might be a bit much for you. They have a great balance of sweetness and spice. Of course, Kettle Chips are just good chips - they use good oil to make them and even the plain ones are tasty. I also like that they are ridged chips - those are usually too crunchy and hard to chew for me - I don't want to have to work that hard for my deliciousness. If you like spicy barbecue you will definitely like these chips."
"Be careful of size description here - listed as .1 oz. jars when clearly the jar itself says .01 ounce. That is a HUGE difference. Shop around - you can find saffron from several retailers for $85-$95 per ounce, thus making this .03 total ounces valued at $2.70. I know this is an awesome spice at a ridiculous price (no matter where you order it from), but a diligent consumer will save alot. It will also be beneficial to learn what to look for in high quality saffron vs. low quality. Happy surfing!"
"This is a quick & easy way to make green tea. It isn't sweet & only has the barest hint of blueberry, but it makes it easy when pressed for time in the morning. It does have more green tint to it than most teas- here's why: ""Sencha green tea comes from the Kyoto region of Japan. It is made from small leaves and has a more refined taste than others forms of green tea. Additionally, the color of the tea is actually green, not yellow, like many Chinese varieties."" Powdered tea is also good for cooking as well."
This is the best cocoa ever. It beats out anything you can buy in the store.  Sometimes<br />I just mix it in my coffee and it's wonderful.  Highly recommend.
"Sorry, folks, but my pit bull mix destroyed this toy in less than two hours. He even ripped off the top and chipped the indestructible plastic... if you have a ""busy"" dog, this is probably not for you."
I don't know what to say that others have not covered. If you like potato chips you will like these. Get em on sale when you can and limit your intake...if you can...
I am so surprised that they have this popcorn for sale.  I received 6 bags the other day and the special popcorn pan from Wabash Valley Farms Amish Country ....GOURMET ... well.. the popped kernels are the size of a pea and with hulls.  It burns very easily.  There are too many old maids due to the delicate nature of the kernel.  I ended up throwing most of the popped corn away.  I am so disappointed in this product.  I now have 5.75 bags of this stuff ... I have nothing good to say about it ... but if you like tiny popped corn with lots of hulls then this may be your product.  I am giving mine to the squirrels.
"I ordered this product after thoroughly enjoying a competitor's black truffle sea salt product.  I had high hopes in being able to equally enjoy a white truffle version of this condiment because I rate white truffle higher in the flavor scale than black truffle.  The item was delivered on time in a vacuum sealed pouch.  The aroma upon opening the pouch was hypnotizing - made my mouth water in anticipation.  I place a portion into a glass jar to serve from and left the remaining product in the re-sealable pouch.<br /><br />After a couple of weeks the aroma disappeared and so did the truffle taste in the salt from both the glass jar refrigerated sample and the remaining product in the original pouch.  Because the list of ingredients did not identify the source of the truffle flavor, I have concluded that this was a sea salt product with added artificial truffle essence, the laboratory created aroma of truffle that contains no real truffle bits or natural flavoring.  As such I believe I wasted my money on what is now a bag of sea salt whose saltiness is on the bland side as well."
"I have the enviable job of getting two pills into Cee Cee daily. I would mix them with her wet food (brand X). There were times she would NOT eat her foodies! There went the pills and my money. But I decided to buy ONE can of this food to see if she would eat it -- wow -- she scarfed up everythiing, pills included!! She LOOOVES her Friskies Selects Indoor Cat Food, Classic Chicken Entree with Brown Rice & Garden Greens. So now she has 20 cans, all for HER!! And I am so glad she is taking her pills now with no complaints!!"
"I tried this baby food several times, even though it it recommended 7 months & older, my 10 month old baby is not able to handle this food.<br />She's able to ""chew"" other, more textured baby food, but this just makes her throw up (literally...unfortunately)!<br />It has a very weird texture, that I've never seen before in any baby food (organic or not)!<br />Even warming it up or mixing it with fruit only food did not help, it looks like it is not ""moist"" enough.<br />I can't recommend to buy this food, we didn't have the problem with organic baby food of other brands."
"Good cup of coffee. If you are looking for a nice cup to wake up to, this is it. Light blend, no overpowering taste. I prefer bolder blends but my husband likes light - so this was our compromise blend, and I enjoy it as much as he does."
"I like this hot  once in awhile, usually make it iced along w/a few bags of Celestial Seasonings' Bengal Spice, very chai like tea this is...I just like added cinnamon flavor."
Handy cups were easy to fill using the enclosed stand and performed quite well. Lids fit snugly and ran well through my Keurig machine.
"The lids keep popping off when the cup fills up with water, the only I have not tried is putting 2 holes in bottom of the cup so that the water might flow out faster. It's a damn mess getting coffee grounds in your cup! I would not buy anymore of them, unless I can fix the problem!!!!!No more disposebale K-cups for me!"
"I purchased this at my local health food store and I am enjoying it immensely.  The juice has a nice, robust texture, and it is not overly salty. The flavor is amazingly fresh and refreshing.<br />I combine it with Odwalla flash-pasteurized 100% carrot juice for a well-above-average vegetable juice that is a good energy-booster and makes for a great alternative to orange juice or other sweet juices.<br />Enjoy!"
"I used this squid ink for a recipe out of Ferran Adria's new Family Meal cookbook.  I had to buy on Amazon since apparently no one in Dallas has ever heard of or carried squid ink in their stores.  Thank goodness for online ordering!<br /><br />I used two of the four packets for the recipe (for 2 servings of squid risotto), and it dissolved into the fish stock pretty easily.  I was expecting any stray droplets to permanently stain my counter, but that didn't happen.  It wipes up easily.  The taste was good...kind of salty and milder than I expected.  I've never had squid ink before, so I can't tell if this product is better or worse than others, but I liked it and the dish turned out well.  I'm just glad that I didn't need much more for the recipe since this product could get a little pricey in larger quantities."
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5M3Y"">Sadaf Pitted Prunes Black, 12-Ounce Packages (Pack of 4)</a><br /><br />This item was full of mold (fungus) on reciept!"
"I've ordered this product from Amazon before and always been happy with its delivery condition, until this package arrived. I opened it and found most of the little creamer containers to be crushed to some degree, with the creamer leaked out all over the inside of the box. It had apparently been in this condition for a while as some of the creamer had thickened and adheared to the insides of the box in nasty clumps. At first, I thought perhaps I could check and save some of the little containers, but on second look, it was apparent I was wrong. What a nasty mess, and the worst part is even if I wanted to return this mess, I discovered it cannot be returned. So I'm appealing to you to consider refunding this horendous example of bad packaging. Until now, I've always been happy with Amazon and will probably order many other things down the road despite this incident, but I just think I shouldn't have to pay for such a mess. Thank you, Susan"
"This bone is nothing more than a very expensive dog biscuit. My dog consumed the entire thing in less than 20 minutes. He really enjoyed it, but there is no way I'm going to buy another one. There are a lot of  more durable bones that cost the same or less than this one. I do not recommend it at all.<br /><br />My dog loves Nybone products. All the other ones seem to last a long time. I guess this ""Edible"" line is just made for eating and not chewing. In my opinion, the price is way too high for what you get. I highly recommend other Nybone products, but steer clear of this one."
"My husband has Celiac disease, so we try lots of products.  We found this mix recently and loved it.  I added a few extra chocolate chips.  My kids had no clue it was GF, and I didn't feel the need to make a second pan of ""regular"" wheat based brownies.  As with most GF bread products, don't over cook.  We like these better than Betty Crocker, which are kind of sugary/grainy, though still pretty tasty.  We also like them better than Pamela's (though I liked Pamela's fine, personally...my hubby was indifferent, and he's got to eat the stuff.)"
I tried breast feeding my baby but was only getting few drops. But after using this my supple went up gradually and now after two months I am getting enough for my baby. I dont know what happens if I stop taking this but I dont want to find out.
i was disapointed in this salt. since it is a truffle salt i expected to taste at least a hint of Truffle but didnt. if you want a really good Truffle flavored salt order Fusion Black Truffle salt it has a wonderfully strong aroma and great flavor!
"contrary to all of the glowing reviews this is the worst Earl Grey tea I've ever had - and that is comparing against bagged tea from the grocery store in addition to other loose leaf brands.<br /><br />The smell is way too perfume like yet still a bit pleasant, but the taste is nothing like the smell.  Way too astringent for me - yuck.  I've tried various weights and water temps to no avail.  The first steeping is not good, the second is more drinkable for me, 3rd steeping is not worth the effort.<br /><br />I've choked down the first can and a half.  I'm going to gift the 3rd unopened can to someone who might enjoy it more than myself.<br /><br />This tea is so bad I wonder if Rishi is all marketing, packaging, and setting price points to brand a sub-par product and then have a team post positive reviews all over the net.  I'm not saying its so, but it does make one wonder . . .<br /><br />2 stars only because I didn't horque it up."
Not strong enough for the first cup in the morning.  I need something strong to wake me up. Maybe I should have found a stronger blend
"I  was so happy to see that someone realized that the Kcup is a product in a lot of homes.  These disposable Kcups make using ground coffee a simple clean and easy way to enjoy a favorite coffee, tea or hot chocolate beverage easy  I work as a merchandiser and am always searching to find the new products and making sure that I can reccomend the products to the customers and stores that I service"
"Our dogs (30lb and 40lb Corgi/border collie mixes) love it, it's about the right level of difficulty.<br /><br />It was evident pretty quickly, though, that as soon as our bigger dog figured out how to sink his teeth into the plastic enough to pick it up from the bottom and bash it against things to shake the contents out that it was going to have a rough life, and so it's proven.<br /><br />After a couple months of fairly regular use, the body of the jug has split all the way down from the mouth to the bottom cap on two sides.  It still works, but the pieces are only held together by the bottom cap and the rubber ball at the mouth."
I know nothing about this CO2 method of decaffeinating but thought I would give this a try. I usually buy the Swiss water processed. This had a wonderful chocolatey taste. It also claimed to be 99.9% caffein free. Hopefully this is all true because it really is the best I have tried of decaf.
Usually do not get the breakfast blends but it was on sale and decided at price would try it out. It was not as weak as some breakfast blends tend to be. Not bad.
"Ughh ..l I tried getting a toy for my puppy to play with to dispense treats.. it worked for a day.. my puppy was slammimg this jug around .. and the treats would dispense out .. he whipped it around he loved it ..but it cracked on the bottom and that's that.. so out of commission .. but nosey if you do not have and carpets or rugs in your home.. i have hard wood floor .. it was loud and nosey ,which was ok for a few minutes but then, i had to take it away .. good idea but my pup is 3 months old  pitbull/german shepard mix.. he is active so now i ihave to shop for another treat dispenser.. i will submit a video of what i am talking about .. i just purchased another toy I will tell you how it goes .. i ordered the squirrel that dispenses treats i heard it was strirdy !!"
"With all natural ingredients and no preservatives; all I can say is ""fantastic"".  There is no expiration date but I would eat this within a week or two -- faster if it's opened.  Absolutely excellent!<br /><br />You can freeze these with no loss of quality.<br /><br />Don't order if the weather is hot because they ship it in cool bags with cold packs instead of styrofoam with dry ice.  My orders usually arrive cool but not cold."
"First of all: I agree with the other reviewers, way to expensive here on Amazon. You can save at least $10.00 if you pick it up a your local Sams Club, that is where I got mine. Sad to say since Amazon makes it so convenient.<br />With that out of the way ....Lively Colombian by Folgers should be categorized as a medium-dark roast to me. Not everyone has the same taste buds but I found it to be a wee-bit on the bitter side, even at the largest cup. Would I buy this again: yes! I don't mind it being a wee-bit bitter but in my opinion Colombian coffee should be bold & smooth tasting not bold & bitter. I know Diedrich Colombia coffee has that bold & smooth taste I prefer; there must be something in the word ""Lively"" that Folgers put on this box to indicate that it may be bitter. Like I said: not everyone has the same taste buds so if you are the least bit hesitant about the word ""bitter"" I typed here, I would suggest you get this k-cup in a variety pack first instead of buying this 80 count then regretting it later."
"i received two 9 in x 9 1/2 inch bags containing 1 pound of anise seeds.  i am so stoked about the the culinary possibilities.  the spices were fresh and smelled wonderful.  i will buy from FRONTIER again.  i looked up some info on the Internet which indicated that to impart a stronger flavor to toast before using.  I CANNOT WAIT TO START COOKING!!!  thank you, FRONTIER"
"This is a great alternative to regular soda in the sense that aside from being carbonated just like a regular soda, it contains vitamins and no added sugar making it really a healthy alternative. Its sparkling appearance also adds to the attraction to this juice. The only downside I can think of for this is it is expensive. Other than that its very satisfying."
The soup taste terrible.  The picture with big chunks of chicken is extremely misleading. There is almost no chicken in the soup.
"My sister told me about this popcorn, saying it is the best she ever had.  Wow, I must have gotten a bad batch.  Mine is very dry, crumbly and hully.  The kernals fall to pieces and have so many pieces in hull in them, they are impossible to eat.  Will Not purchase again!"
Loved this...kids finished off the entire pot! I added much more to the recipe as it is quite salty. I would say almost doubled everything...adding corn...black beans...onion etc.
"Got 8 of these and they're a pretty good size. It's just garlic, salt, pepper and oregano... a time saver having them all together."
We love these crackers but getting them through the mail doesn't work - all the crackers were broken and crumbly.
"Just be aware.....the first ingredient on the list is salt.  I don't find this product very peppery, hot or spicy.  It is a disappointment."
"The ""Sugar and Maple"" label on the top and front of the box also states ""Natural & Artificial Flavors,"" as does the ingredient list on the side of the box.<br /><br />But ""Artificial"" is not mentioned in the Product Details or Ingredient list on the selling web page. Instead, there is a disclaimer that the ingredients may ""differ.""  That is deception.  Was that really necessary?<br /><br />We don't buy ANYTHING with artificial flavors in it.<br /><br />Quaker has a long reputation of excellence and should know better."
"To me this coffee was extremely bitter.  I dumped it out and made a different cup.

"I have 4 dogs and all were sick on this food. One actually almost died. It had to be ressucitated. After I spent $4,000.00 on Vet's bills I decided to call the FDA to analize this food. They found Ethoxyquin on it - a pesticide. [...] I just want to make sure if someone out there has the same problem, that it must be known. I'm still not happy about this incident. I decided not to pursue it any longer, but I still feel people should know. These 'Organic' companies can't get away misleading people. If everyone exposed them, then this would be a better world. Think about it...<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YQMB1G"">Newman's Own Organics Chicken Rice, Advanced Dry, 25-Pound</a>"
"If you enjoy pork rinds you are going to love this product. Hot and fresh pork rinds beat the socks off any of that bagged stuff from the grocery store that taste like steyrofoam packing peanuts. These little gems cook up light and crispy right from the microwave. They have a mildly spicy flavor that builds up as you make way through the serving but the heat never gets too powerful. The key to getting the best yield is to shake the bag before cooking. That will distribute the pellets evenly. Then you have to find the ""sweet spot"" for cooking time. Mine is 2 min 30 sec which leaves me with no burnt or uncooked pieces. I only have two minor criticisms: 1) The serving size is a little small and 2)the spice mixture is a tad bit too salty for me. Otherwise, these things are tops !"
"Newman products have been used in our home for years. After researching Newman's Adult Dog food I felt confident in giving the food to our two cocapoo's. They love it! One of them wolfs it down in 4 seconds! Really, I timed it.<br />With so many companies recalling dog foods,I felt the Newman company being organic would be more reliable. Keeps me from worrying so much as I pour that bowl of food for them."
I thought that because of the name attached that I would be wow-ed...its just a good average coffee nothing spectacular.
This bone is nothing more than a big dog treat.  I have a 2 yr old Pit who ate through the souper in 5 minutes.  After reading other reviews I took it away from him and will save the rest for a later date.  I was hoping for a bone that would last a little bit longer as a chew toy and not just be eaten like a treat.  Will not be buying this again.
My vet recommended this years ago for my cat who has a digestive tract the size of dental floss. Always got at Pet Smart. Cheaper on Amazon and delivered right to my door.
Just got these in today and opened up 2 of the packages to put them in the cookie jar. They were not any broken and they are delicious. So full of chocolate chips!!!! I recommend these to anyone to get. They came to me in a large box with other things I ordered and they were in great shape.
Not the best product for the price. I got these for my dog that has plaque problems but I haven't really seen any improvement since we got them. They are okay to give as a treat but as far as helping with plaque I don't think they work at all.
Purchased these by the case since they are so hard to find in my local store.  Also enlisted in the auto delivery program.  The only problem is by purchasing them 12 at a time - they are always in the house and tempting me.  Will never go back to regular chips again.
This device's lid does not seal.  I am not sure why it is being sold as anything other than a trashcan.  Did work well for beer as long as it was transferred to a secondary right at the end of fermentation.
"Why eat regular potato chips, when you can eat pop chips. The BBQ Flavor gets boring pretty quickly, so don't eat a whole lot in a few days."
"Same great taste as the honeybush tea bags, but so much more green!  Thank you for packaging this in bulk!"
"Sometimes, I'd rather have cocoa instead of coffee at work. This meets my cocoa craving. I do not need to add sugar - just add water and brew!"
"I had a handful of these crackers last night - and though they are tasty, my hands, face, and ankles swelled to a ridiculous size.  I wasn't sure if it was the crackers or something else I ate - so I ate them by themselves at lunch - and again, I am a swollen mess.<br /><br />I didn't realize the MSG content was so high.  I won't be eating these again.  If you react to salt, sodium, or MSG - just stay away from these tasty little buggers."
"I bought 4 of those boxes to serve as one element of an antipasto in a large party. Everybody was satisfied and requested that I use this same supply for our next year party.  Only one negative comment: there were not 60 by box as expected, boxes were uneaven due to size of each stuffed leaf. Next time I will order an additionnal small bo."
"I used to be a fan of Canidae, but after $2k in recent vet bills and a very sick dog, I found out there is a HUGE amount of Consumer Affairs complaints about this company.<br /><br />After blood work, ultrasound and many other tests trying to figure out why my dog wasn't eating, was throwing up on the rare occasion he did, had pockets of gas the size of base balls (he is a small dog) and had all the symptoms of kidney and liver failure, my vet determined it might be the food. I found that hard to believe, but we couldn't find anything else wrong. If you read the complaints you will see many people have lost their dogs. They started using one of the very companies for production whose imported food killed so many animals a year or so ago.<br /><br />As soon as I quit feeding him this poison, he started getting better. I was one of the lucky ones since my pet did not die, but as I write this, he still has not gained all his weight back.<br /><br />The company is acting as if nothing is wrong. Probably on the advice of their attorneys.<br /><br />You don't need to take my word for it, please read up... http://www.consumeraffairs.com/pets/canidae.html"
"I really like the flavor, not exactly like real peanut butter but still tasty. And I don't feel bad about eating it like I do when I eat 10 grams of fat on regular peanut butter. I do agree with the previous review, price is high especially since it doesn't last as long as the regular PB. Although there always seems to be a higher price on unique products like this one. I bought both the original PB and Chocolate PB, I like original better. I'll buy it again."
"The first thing you notice when you open a tin of Twinings Lady Grey<br /><br />(beside the redolence of bergamot oil mixed with the aroma of black tea and lemon which is a staple of the *Earl* Grey Teas) is the striking visual pattern of the loose tea:<br /><br />Dark dry tea leaves sprinkled with bright dots of dry orange peel and stunningly-blue cornflower petals.  It is almost as pleasing to the eye as it is to the taste buds. Milder and less caffeinated than the Earl, this mix has become a permanent inhabitant of our pantry and our tea cups for almost 5 years now.<br /><br />Note that unlike Earl Grey, *Lady Grey* seems to be a Trademark of the Twinings Co.  If you are looking for a similar tea that is not manufactured by Twinings, you may have a hard time figuring what is the exact equivalent.  For example, some other companies market a blend called ""Pouchkine"" or ""Afternoon Earl Grey"" which essentially are milder versions of the traditional Earl Grey and lack some proprietary Twinings-only ingredients (most notably, the cornflowers)."
"these pork rinds are a great value plus they are fun to watch them puff up from a small piece to a giant puffy tasty pork rind! I also like the fact you can make as much as you like.I like to make small batches so I can eat them when they are still warm.So easy to make, pop them in the microwave a minute or two and time for a tasty treat ENJOY!"
"My grandkids and I love the mints in the tin and thought we would try these to cut down on packaging. They taste terrible. They have a funny after taste and really don't taste like cinnamon. We won't buy them again. We buy many Newman's Own products, but are disappointed this time. If they aren't the same mints, they should have a different name."
I thought this fondant was very easy to work with and it tasted great! Also the wedding cake i used this product for turned out awesome and the bride and groom and their guest loved their cake!
"These are expensive, but amazing treats.  My dog goes crazy for them.  She literally starts shaking when she gets a whiff.  They break apart easy, if you have a smaller dog, or just want to make them last longer."
"These packs have the perfect recipe of oil, corn, and seasoning. I've been trying to get a corn recipe that duplicates the flavor of a big amusement-park popper. Put this corn in a souvenir bucket from one of our big amusement parks in Orlando and you can't tell the difference. Everybody that's tasted it is very impressed.<br /><br />I have a whirly-pop popper, the larger size that should use the 5.5oz packs that come with the popper. While these 6oz packs work fine in the popper, the corn nearly bursts from the popper. Next time I'll get the 4oz packs.<br /><br />Perfect texture, fluffiness, color, and flavor. I love it!"
"I love chips and can easily go through an entire bag in one sitting. With Popchips single serve pouches, I can now feel good about snacking as each bag is only 100 calories. The single serve pouches also help in portion control. The larger bags are a slightly better value, but unless you have astounding self control, I would recommend the single serving option. They are that good! They easily stand up to any of the traditional fried chips I've ever had, and at half the fat and calories, how could you ask for anything more?<br /><br />The variety pack comes in 6 flavors: Original, Sour Cream and Onion, Salt and Pepper, Cheddar, Salt and Vinegar, and BBQ. My favorite flavors are Salt and Pepper and Cheddar. My least favorite is Salt and Vinegar, but I don't like ANY salt and vinegar flavored chip. My only wish is that this variety pack contained the Parmesan Garlic flavor which is VERY good, but extremely hard to find in local stores. I have ordered the Parmesan Garlic flavor in a 24 pack here on Amazon, but prefer the assortment that comes in the variety pack.<br /><br />At ~$17 after the subscribe and save discount, each bag costs only 70 cents. This is a bargain for these great tasting, healthy chips and I highly recommend you try them!"
"I guess there's no telling what will tickle the palate.  I'm a huge Tabasco fan, and I love unconventional snacks.  But these don't taste to me even remotely like the wonderful sauce they're made from; I didn't find them to have much of a kick at all.  Practically bland, in fact.  Even with my strong aversion to wasting food, I had to throw out or give away most of the case.  Do yourself a favor and find a bag of these locally before taking a chance on 12."
the product was hard as a rock. i could not even break it in half. both dogs had hard time chewing them. puppy could not either will not get product again. unless the two packages i got were old and dried out.
"I love this sugar.  It is the only sweetener that I use now.  I bought my first case a few months ago and am getting ready to order the 2nd one.  For me... a little goes a long way as I don't care for anything overly sweet.  I use the same amount of this product that I used with the organic sugar I've now replaced.  For Lucy who is wondering whether this is 100% organic coconut sugar, the ingredient list states: organic granulated coconut nectar (it is made from the flower buds of the coconut tree).  It is very yummy!  I have even introduced others to it who like it so much they are now ""converts""."
"Kombu is a wonderful energizer, especially during the summer and in the cold and flu season.<br /><br />Drop one strip into boiling water for 2 to 3 minutes, remove and cut into smaller pieces.  Add to 6 cups of water, then add 12 teaspoons of shiro Miso (mild white miso), heat and stir until miso dissolves.  Avoid boiling the ingredients. Add cubed tofu (soft is best), spinach or swiss chard cut into thin strips, shiitake mushrooms cut in thin strips and scallions thinly cut including the green part (reserve half for soup garnish). Heat, but do not boil, for about 10 minutes.  Servie with a splash of soy sauce for a little extra flavor.<br /><br />The Kombu has a very mild flavor and best if not overcooked or over softened.  Great for vegans and better than chicken soup!<br /><br />Enjoy !"
"When I received this item, I was very disappointed with it. It is rather cheap looking and I wouldn't want this on my counter for all to see. The left side of the tray was lopsided and looked strange when you pulled it out. Needless to say I boxed it back up and sent it back for a full refund. Definitely not worth $25.00, but after seeing it I would have been equally disappointed had I paid only $10.00."
"Don't waste your money on any of the Kettle brand potato chips.  I bought a case of these, and a case of the cheddar and sour cream.  Both cases ended up in the garbage can."
"I love using generous amounts of vinegar on sandwiches, salads, etc., but this drink was so vinegary that I got a bit of a tummy ache.  It tasted closer to salad dressing than it did a drink.  I tried really hard to like it, but no go."
"My 9 year old daughter has celiac disease, and these are one of her favorite cookies (other than the ones I make!)  They are a great quick snack for her to bring and have on hand so that she DOESN'T feel left out or deprived when cookies are offered to kids in social situations."
They are great. I love them and eat them every day. They are less expensive at the grocery store than online.
brought my first bag back from Melbourne 7 years ago and have been ordering it ever since. The best finishing salt for fresh vegetables - steamed or raw!
"I really  like this dental treat and my dogs love them.  They are wheat free which is great for my German short=hair pointer who is wheat intolerant.  Only problem is it is hard to find this product in my local pet stores and on line.  I even contacted the manufacturer, who was not very helpful in locating it and just referred me back to my local pet store who hasn't had this in stock for EVER.  I have since given up on finding it."
I just cannot understand the high praise these chips have received! AGREE. I ordered the Sea Salt&Vinger packs and am very disappointed. Ver weird Vinegary awful taste. The salt and vinegar especially tasted gross! I took one bite and had to throw the bag away. Agrre. Now I'm stuck with a bunch of 23 bags of chips that I'll never eat.
"This product is the same as I get in Petsmart at a much better price. The service was quick and efficient. We use it for our old wiener dog who has some iron deficiencies and it helped him alot, but I am not a vet."
"My girlfriend loves grapefruit, but I absolutely hate the stuff.  For her, it starts and ends very sweet, for me (and most people in the world) it starts sweet and ends bitter.  After we tried the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001LXYA5Q"">Miracle Berry Fruit Tablets</a>tablet, there was a small difference for both of us.  For me, the bitterness subsided a small amount-- not even enough to worth mentioning.  For her, the grapefruit tasted like one of the ""sweetest"" ones she'd ever had.<br /><br />However, the real treat for both of us came with the lemons and limes.  Both of which tasted noticeably better.  However, the effect of a single tablet wore off completely within 5 minutes.  To be honest, I hoped each tablet would last closer to an hour, but as is, you're paying quite a bit per minute for these things (we paid ~$20 for ten tablets w/ shipping).<br /><br />Would I try it again?  After the tablets we have left are finished, I think not.  I already enjoy gala apples, bananas, watermelon, oranges, and strawberries without this tablet-- I can live a perfectly happy life without ever eating grapefruit, lemons or limes DIRECTLY (lemon and lime are fine in foods).<br /><br />If you're dead-set on trying these tablets, try it with some of your friends, but don't expect too much."
I bought a Tassimo coffee machine for my daughter and her college roommates. They absolutely love the machine and the Peppermint Mocha disappeared quickly last winter. It appears that this flavor is seasonal. My daughter wanted more as soon as I found it available. The delivery was quick. My daughter said this Tassimo selection is even better than Starbucks and is far less expensive. Well worth it.
"According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats."
This Wolfgang Puck Coffee Jamaica Me Crazy is the worst coffee I've ever had!<br />I threw it out right away after one sip! It taste like all coconut flavoring.<br />Hard to believe someone thought this taste good and was marketable. They should be fired!

"I read several of these reviews that state how often this product arrives damaged.  I decided to chance it and order it anyway hoping to be one of the lucky people who wrote good reviews.  The box arrived and I could see and smell the leaking creamer from the porch.  I had not been one of the lucky few.  Several of the containers had ruptured and leaked all inside the box.  If you like washing close to two hundred tiny containers of liquid, go ahead and order this product. You'll enjoy it."
"We have a miniature Dachshund named Buck. We used this product to house and obedience train him. Now we use this as his daily treat, and he loves it! My Vet. told me this is a nearly prefect low fat treat. As a result of using Pro-Treat, we hardly ever have to use a leash while walking Buck. If it were not for local leash laws, we would not own a leash. The only problem I see with this product is the inconsistent size of the peices. It ranges from powder to 1 inch square, and every thing in between. I have done lots of research and Amazon is the best place to buy this stuff"
They have other flavors but the dogs favorite is still the original. I wish they carried it in the local petstore we go to purchase their other flavors!
"The candy was sent for a birthday gift.  It is the first time using this company.  The person receiving the gift said some of the candy tasted old.  However, the company is giving me a full refund."
"This is pretty retarded - how many have you sold, at DOUBLE the cool, refreshing retail price? You're a freak."
"The Switch Kiwi Berry carbonated fruit beverage is certainly different than what one expects to get out of a carbonated drink. Because it is 100% fruit juice, as opposed to fruit flavored, it is much more refreshing than the typical fruit flavored sparkling beverage. At 135 calories and 34 grams of carbohydrates - 33 grams of sugar - it might be a little heavy for the health or weight conscious. The only other drawback might be that the carbonation flattens out the depth of the flavor just a little. Nonetheless, Switch is a tasty and refreshing carbonated fruit beverage."
"I am so happy to have discovered these chips. I hate stealing a phrase from another product, but they melt in your mouth. I have ordered and tried all flavors without disappointment.Just getting ready to place another order for these 100 calorie per bag, air popped chips. Do try them people!"
"Ever since I attended nursing school, I have been wary of salt. I'm trying to cut salt from my diet now while I am young so it isn't difficult to make the shift when I get older. This is an AMAZING product, I can't believe it is salt free. I put it on everything! It would not be useful for baking as there are other added savory spices, but to give foods some zest this is some awesome stuff. Everyone I know is getting one in their stocking this year!"
"I am using these packets in a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SU35"">Wabash Valley Farms 25008 Whirley-Pop Stovetop Popcorn Popper</a> popcorn machine. This size, 4-ounce, makes the perfect pop. I love the flavor of movie theater popcorn and this one has it. I will be purchasing these again!"
I wish I had read that these are made in China before I bought them.  They are going in the trash - lesson learned.
I've been using Lourdes Chimichurri for years - The stuff is awesome. I use it mostly when cooking fish but have recently started to put it in my family's sandwiches. We're also big fans of the guava and mango spreads. Highly recommend these products if you're looking for great taste without the preservatives.
"This should be called Sad Baby--it's awful. My baby absolutely hates it! I tasted a tiny bit<br />and it was bland to the point of gagging. Besides I assumed (wrongly obviously) that Stage 3<br />food--for babies 7+ months--would have some chunks of real food. Unfortunately, it's just glop,<br />and unfortunately, incredibly tasteless glop. I tried other flavors from this brand and they<br />were just as disgusting, my baby wont eat any of the flavors at all."
"This bread is very easy to make. It is far superior to gluten free bread available in stores, even health food stores.  I've been adding poppy seeds to add a slightly different flavor.  It still has the heaviness that all gluten free breads have, but it is lighter than most and toasts well if not cut too thickly. I cut the loaves in half and freeze one half. I use a regular mixing machine."
"Holy barf bag, the jalapeno Popchips are FOUL. I love the original Popchips and I really love Jalapeno, but for some reason the Popchips people just couldn't get the flavor right. I tried one, gagged, and handed the bag off to my dad to try. He was munching cautiously when I mentioned I thought they tasted a bit like garbage. He paused, considered, and said, ""That's it. That's the taste. There's something gym-socky about it."" Save your money!"
"Okay, a lot of chicken breast treats from China are causing dogs to be sick (see the FDA website for details).  This is not one of them, but when I started buying it, it was made in the USA.  Now it's made in China.  Although my dogs have long loved this treat, I'm in the process of searching for a replacement made in a safe country."
"*****<br /><br />This Echinacea Immune Support herbal tea from Yogi Tea is for the natural boosting of the immune system. It's an all natural tea made from organic peppermint leaf, organic ;lemon grass, organic Echinacea root (angustifolia, purprea, pallida), organic licorice root, organic cinnamon bark, organic spearmint leaf, organic fennel seed, organic lemon flavor, Echinacea purpurea root extract (phenols 12%), organic cardamom seed, organic rose hips, organic ginger root, organic burdock root, stevia leaf, organic mullein leaf, organic clove bud, astragalus root extract, organic black pepper, European elder berry extract (30% anthocyanins), natural cinnamon oil, natural cardamom oil, natural ginger oil. Whew! Lots of good ingredients!<br /><br />The taste is unusual and hard to define, probably because there are so many interesting ingredients. It is slightly tonic-y but very pleasant. I love all the things that these herbs are purported to do!<br /><br />I am definitely impressed with Echinacea Immune Support and with Yogi Teas in general. Echinacea Immune Support comes with an expiration date (a good thing, because it's not full of preservatives, plus you can tell if it is fresh). Yogi Tea seems to be another company (like Numi, Aspen, Traditional Medicinals) that values sustainable and healthy practices. Their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed, with info about each tea they make.<br /><br />Yogi Tea writes this on the box about the tea's benefits: ""Echinacea Immune Support tea is a superior blend of several species of Organic Echinacea Root (Echinacea angustifolia, purpurea, pallida) designed to boost your immune system. Each tea bag is made with organic Echinacea Root and Echinacea Root extract, containing the equivalent of 1,400 mg of Echinacea. Health practitioners for centuries have respected the powers of Echinacea, an herb that supports the body's natural defense system by stimulating production of immune system proteins, interferons, that regulate normal immune response. Furthermore, Echinacea supplies certain naturally-occurring plant compounds known as caffeic acid derivatives, including cichoric acid, alkylamides and polysaccharides. These work together to stimulate the body's immune system. The blend is complemented with Astragalus, a stamina-enhancing tonic that also boosts long-term immune function, and European Elder Berry, which is immune-enhancing and supports respiratory function. To support sinus function and promote clear breathing passages, Organic Peppermint and Organic Lemon Grass are included.* Finally, Organic Cinnamon , Organic Fennel, Organic Spearmint, and Organic Rose Hips add a wonderful fragrant essence to this delicious herbal supplement.""<br /><br />There are no cautions or warnings on the box except the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. The box says, ""When your immune system seems a bit down, drink 2 to 3 cups per day. For increased immune stimulation, drink 4 to 5 cups per day.""<br /><br />This tea has no caffeine and is entirely herbal. Note that this review is for the six-pack of 16-count boxes, an excellent value overall. Compare it to other six-packs of this same tea on Amazon to make sure it's the best value, though, as they are always cheaper than buying the single boxes, but some are better deals than others.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />*****"
"This is the best no wheat/no dairy bread I have tried. It has excellent consistency and flavor. The best thing is that it stays moist. It is great for sandwiches or toast. I use my bread machine and it comes out fine. Other breads I have tried do not measure up to these features of best flavor, consistency and moistness. In the past I have found it difficult to omit wheat from my diet but this bread makes it easy and very enjoyable.<br />Thank you Pamela's Products"
"Overall I was not happy with the crumbiness of these cookies. They were way to fragile and crumby. There is just too many crumbs in my bed, how am I supposed to sleep like this?"
"I ordered this product thinking it was going to come in a box of 24 (as it is described in the product description). I was a little unsure of whether or not this could be too good to be true, but when I saw that the weight of the item was marked as 6.1 lbs and the shipping/handling was $8 I felt pretty confident that I would be receiving the 24 count box that I thought this to be. When I received the package there was only ONE bone in it. So pretty much I spent $10 on ONE bone that I could have gotten at the store for $3. Dont make the same mistake as me! VERY poor product description by Ozbo!"
"i have just brought one small package of Canidea from my oversea agent 2weeks ago, before my puppy only tried a french brand. First i was just mixed them together and seems ok, but then the old finished there is something weird happened to her, she started eating the stools??!! >:( yes and also vomited white yellowish foam and coughing after totally swished into this brand, even sent her to vet checking blood, taking pills and medical treat which i was thinking she might catch cold. anyway only feel lucky is vet cost much cheaper here...<br />then now she refuse to eat it or only a little if really hungry. most of time she'd rather biting a bone, glad saw the comments here, i will change it to other brand asap :)"
"This can of juice was delicious.  It reminded me of the Orangina beverage.  I did find it strange that they chose to package this product in a can normally associated with ""Energy Drinks"" like Red Bull since they market it as ""All Natural"".  Nevertheless, it's yummy and I recommend it!"
"I was very excited to try this coffee flavor, but when I did, I was very dissapointed.  I think the flavor is too strong, especially since it tastes really fake.  It almost tastes like there is alcohol in it.  Since I ordered the double box, I gave one away to a friend who likes this flavor. I would never buy this coffee again."
"my puppy lab has sensitive stomach, and she can't digest any food/treats that are made with animal products, so I always read the label and make sure there are no animal products. This treat doesn't contain any animal products... It's made with Pumpkin, Oatmeal, Ground Brown Rice, Tapioca Starch, Vegetable Glycerin, Ground Potatoes, Brown Sugar, Canola Oil, Ground Oats, Mangos, Gelatin, Cinnamon, Salt, Natural Mango Flavor, Phosphoric Acid, Sorbic Acid (a preservative), Mixed Tocopherols (a preservative), Rosemary Extract.)<br />I gave her some, and she hasn't had any accident (diarrhea or vomiting) yet. sensitive belly approved!!<br />Also the mango flavor smells really good.. I was really tempting to try one, but i didn't.. lol<br /><br />But why 4 stars? 2 reasons that I give this 4 stars although my dogs and I really love it.<br />1. It's only 5 oz.. It's about $1.4 per 1 oz. I don't mind spending money on good stuff, it's a lil bit pricy for me..comparing to other comparable treats that sell for $9-12 per a pound. (it's just my opinion)<br />2. Not good for training. They're little bit chewy for small dogs.. My dogs chew one treat for a long time.(about 15-20 sec) They're good for snacking though..<br /><br />Anyway, although I gave this product 4 stars, I really highly recommend this for the quailty and deliciousness.."
Works well instead of formula or soy milk for my daughters bottle. Easy to mix as long as water is warmed. And she loves the taste! Plus much more affordable than buying goat milk cartons in the store.
The worst!!! it is just plan awful bitter and strong and you cannot taste the Hazel Nut flavor at all!!!!!  Do not buy this product save your money!!!!!
"I have one cat who cannot tolerate THIS PARticular Fancy Feast Salmon Product. It is only the Shredded one that gets her, but get it does.<br />Everytime she eats it, she throws it up all over everywhere. My shoes, the white rug and gratefully, the tile.<br /><br />She ate this for several years with occasional upsets, but now it is EVERY time. No more for this family. I realize that this occurs on an individual basis USUALLY.<br /><br />But, I also have one younger kitty who is at the ""occasional upset"" stage. So, if you have a kitty with a tender tummy, I would avoid this!!"
"Well I havent actually ordered this product, and frankly Im not going to, I know that in some cases that flat rate shipping is standard, but paying MORE to ship it than to buy it is well just stupid! it weighs 1.5 lbs and costs $9.75 to ship when the product is only $8.50 in the first place!<br />Shipping rates need to come back down I know that people need to make money somewhere but do you really have to make money on the shipping?"
"Ordered this plant to remedy a fruit fly invasion. The amazon shipping was acceptable, but the manufacturer does not create the packaging to facilitate any shipment, unless they were to put ""This side up"" on the box. The dirt was everywhere but where it was supposed to be and the plant (Audrey) was upside down, roots up in the box. If I had found one locally I would have bought it there. Hoping Audrey survives, but I don't have high hopes.<br />EDIT: Audrey is now deceased. Do not recommend."
"I've been told that the refrigerator of the future will have herb/vegetable/salad bins inside to grow vegetables and I thought the Prepara Herb Savor Pod looked like the perfect precursor. Wrong. The detachable bottom comes loose continually and leaks water everywhere. Similarly, the plastic plug at the back does NOT hold. A good idea, a nice-looking product, but poorly executed. Refrain from purchasing -- plastic bags are MUCH, much better."
"Stevia is pretty much the only natural zero-calorie sweetener there is, but most of the time the powdered stevia is so bitter!  Not Nustevia!  Nustevia has absolutely NO bitterness, and tastes EXACTLY like real sugar!  It's amazing!  Add it to plain yogurt, you have an amazing guilt-free dessert, breakfast, side dish, snack.  Add it to tea, coffee, recipes, anything!  It is a truly magical product, and it is cheaper in the 12 oz container on Amazon than anywhere else!  They also sell it at GNC, but it is $10 for 4 oz.  Also, for drinks, I highly recommend the extremely potent liquid stevia, as sometimes the powdered version takes a while to dissolve in iced beverages (it eventually does dissolve, though)."
I too was a little disappointed with the mix of the Donut Sampler. In my case I had 12 of the 35 were decaf.  But I guess this is what you get when you purchase a sampler pack through the Amazon warehouse deals section.  All the k-cups had a best used by date of 6/2012.  I was happy about that atleast.
I love this bar it's a great to in between meals. Low in fat only 150cal.
strong flavored tea the way I like it. I already went through one box in a couple months since I don't use the machine as much as I would like to.
Part of me wants to ask for a refund. I bought this package of k cups because I wanted a mix of teas. When I got my package I was very disappointed to see hardly any teas in the package. I know they substituted based on availability but I think it's completely misleading to substitutes with products that don't pertain to the packaged theme. I got a mix of gingerbread and eggnog. DISAPPOINTING!
"Of course the Keurig Green Mtn Hot Cocoa is the ultimate in convenience, but, frankly, the flavor is not so hot.  Best description is slightly chocolate-flavored cardboard.  Everything else about it is fine (consistency, ease of use), but G.M. should ramp up the flavor with way more chocolate."
Cavender's All pupose salt free Greek Seasonings are great.  I use them for meat rubs and in recipies.  It's a very good product.
"First, I just found out it calls for HALF the Amount of Splenda Blend compared to regular brown sugar by reading these reviews.  In spite of that, I still give it an excellent score!<br /><br />I've always used brown sugars of all kinds in my coffee.  When at the store a few weeks ago I was looking for a lower calorie sweetener for my coffee and happened to buy this Splenda brown sugar blend.  I've been using it in my coffee since and love it.  The only difference I could tell was it was so much sweeter than my usual coffee that when I got close to the bottom of the cup I would pour more coffee into it to stretch the sweetness.  Now I know why...it's twice as sweet as regular brown sugar!<br /><br />Just ordered the 4-pack and this should tide me over for a while - adding it to teas and coffees...delicious! It's also cheaper on Amazon xoxox"
"The hemp oil soft gels really help my sensitive digestion (along with the probiotic, enzyme and lactose pills).  Of course, I still have to watch what I eat and how fast I eat it (slowing down really helps bad digestion).  I suggest buying this product in bulk because the more you take the better it seems to help."
"Quick and easy, a hurry up solution to what to have for dinner. Kept my chops moist, provided good flavor. Good job."
"This fondant tastes good but does not work well for decorating cupcakes. It's very soft and the more you mix in color, the softer it becomes. I added powdered sugar to help make it not stick to my mat, cookie cutters and tools, but it was a constant battle. My major complaint with this fondant is that it doesn't harden. I made decorations 3 days in advance (which I've done in the past using Wilton fondant) and they weren't drying. The morning I needed them, they were so soft that even picking them up distorted the shape. I ended up having to place a high powered fan in front of them while I went to work for 8 hours, only to come home to semi-dry decorations. Because I have a ton left over, I'm going to try and mix gum paste with it to see if that helps with the stickiness and drying time. I do not recommend this product if you're trying to create flowers, stars or any type of decoration that requires tools and drying time. Needless to say, I will not be buying this product again."
"These taste exactly like cinnamon toast crunch, but with the nutritional composition of almonds. They're pretty mind blowing. Don't be afraid of buying a 6-pack; you'll need it."
"Well I bought this item before and enjoyed it immensely. Pink Salmon is very good for you.<br /><br />This time I ordered again, received ALBACORE TUNA INSTEAD OF PINK SALMON. AMAZON DOES NOT DO RETURNS ON GROCERIES SUCH AS THESE, EVEN IF NOT OPENED THAT I CAN SEE. I sent personally an email to Raincoast Trading Company based in Canada, also left a phone message as well. Delayed response, but finally got emails and they were courteous but they redirected me to try help center to get credit and get the correct item. Gone through hoops in the help center of Amazon to no avail. Until I found the Toll Free Amazon phone number, Amazon LLC confirmed they can not accept the return, but will send the correct item promptly. We shall see, awaiting a replacement item.<br />A minor complaint they are smaller can sizes than the normal pink salmon I am used to ordering.<br />Anyone want some tuna? O well.<br /><br />P.S. Updated  review Sept 30th 2009, I finally got the ordered item, partly because the Amazon rep corrected it when I called in and sent it fast! BTW, it cost me a Toll Call to Canada to the company without a prompt reply. That just added insult to injury. Well I was able to order from a different merchant through Amazon. Thank you Amazon for coming through :)"
When I first purchased my Keurig coffee maker I couldn't decide how to store the K-cups. I didn't want to give<br />up my counter space for the carousel. I settled for a flat holder that with open compartments and could be<br />put in a drawer or attached to the wall. I didn't want to spend the extra few dollars for this drawer type.<br />After shifting that one around from drawer to balanced against the wall I finally gave in and went for this great holder that allows the Keurig to sit on top and now I have my counter space back and a nice neat area for my<br />Keurig. I hope that I can save someone some time and money by letting you know about my experience.
don't overcook -  absorbs sauce well -- we eat plain with butter and a little sea salt.  All of Eden's pastas are exceptional.
"How many ways can you say ""YUM!"" ?  It's a delicious way to wake up in the morning--or to enjoy any time of the day."
"I had a recipe that called for a lot of dark chili powder and the only place I could find it was amazon.com.  I bought a jar of this and it made two batches of the chili recipe I have.  The chili was the best I'd ever made.  I can vouch that this chili powder really does make a big difference in the flavor of a chili.  It is rich with a bit of a kick.  Everyone has been crazy for it, and I think its due to this chili powder. I'm back to buy the bag this time!"
"I used it with my dog a couple dozen times, and she thoroughly enjoyed it.  One time she managed to unscrew the bottom, and with that experience, she fixated on the bottom as the ""ultimate solution"" for the last morsels that weren't coming out from tilting and dropping the toy.  She cracked through the hard plastic, breaking both the lid and the jug.  The toy is advertised for ""heavy chewers"" but the container obviously doesn't hold up.  I hope the store will offer a refund."
"I was totally disappointed with this coffee, I did not listen to few reviews that already mentioned this is crap.<br />If you are looking for good coffee, this is not it. That's all.<br />Moreover, you cannot return this item !!"
The Jimmies had purple in the mix.  That was exactly what I was looking for.  Since we are not planning on eating these (but throwing them instead of rice). I won't know taste.  But color is excellent!
I bought this tea at Stop and Shop and it clearly has warnings on it but I didn't expect it to cause like a panic attack or something uncomfortable like my heart to beat loudly as it was audible. I don't fancy the flavor of this tea.  Yogi makes a sampler with this one in it.
"We gave these out to grooming customers, and the reports we got back were that the dogs loved them.  They're all natural, so I felt comfortable giving them out."
The tea tin is guarding the aroma very well.<br />The taste is beautiful: the Malva flowers do soften the taste and the amount of bergamot is just right.<br />The first time I used too much tea and soaked it for too long (I used as reference Darjeeling FTGFOP First Flush).<br />Since then I save on the quantity of tea leaves and soak the tea for only two minutes.<br />A delight: the best Earl Grey I ever had. The price is very competitive.
"I agree with the others' comments about buying from Amazon.<br /><br />We've ordered these chocolates before directly from Lindt and they've arrived in perfect condition - crisp shiny shells that SNAP when you bite into them, and fillings that literally melted in your mouth. So when Amazon offered them at a special price and sent directly from Amazon with free shipping, even better, right?<br /><br />Wrong. I don't know how these were stored but they arrived in mid-April when temps in Chicago the entire week before had ranged from the low 30s to the mid 50s, but they'd obviously been subjected to much warmer conditions. The shells were soft and kind of sticky and with none of the usual Lindt gloss, and the fillings were almost the same texture. The taste was barely adequate but the texture was not even close to what it should be even if you'd bought them off a grocer's shelf and a number of them even had dents in the shells although so far none seem to have been completely melted.<br /><br />If you can buy them directly from Lindt in the middle of December, you'll probably be ok. Otherwise think twice before ordering unless you can be pretty sure they've been properly stored."
"These are not the ""same old"" chips by far and the Asian Sweet & Spicy sparked my imagination too, makes you appreciate the new and improved variety of potatoe chips. This flavor is easily an ""8"" on the ten-scale."
"I bake a lot of vegan cookies, quick breads and muffins... and pumpkin is a great ingredient to add moisture and flavor.  My grocery store is out of canned pumpkin more than half of the time so I've turned to amazon, and discovered this brand in the process.  The flavor is good and the price is great.  I always prefer to buy organic over non so that's a big plus.  I've ordered two cases thus far and will definitely reorder when I run out!"
I was really looking forward to trying these chips since I love cheese but I was SUPER DISAPPOINTED! I am a big fan of Kettle Chips but these tasted somewhat stale and almost plain! They are supposed to have a cheddar taste but you cannot taste any of that...it's annoying. I do not recommend this flavor..salt and vinegar and buffalo bleu are my favorite.
"Great stuff and dependable, especially when there are a million brands ""out there"" to choose from.  I love the stuff.  For really high end desires, I go with the Apollo Olive Oils from California.  But I buy a whole lot more of this stuff and will buy it again and again."
"Ordered these for my mom, they came quickly, and she loved their peanut butter filled taste.  Arrived in great shape."
I saw this first on Oprah and it is every bit as good as she said it was!!! I am hooked on Frrrozen Hot Chocolate!
"So, ideally we'd all make gravy totally from scratch using only the pan drippings from whatever meat we're cooking, but... sometimes you just don't get that much in the way of pan drippings, and yet you want LOTS of gravy. And sometimes you're cooking, say, sausages (bangers & mash, anyone??) or something else that isn't going to result in juices you can make gravy from, and yet you still require a big jug of gravy to pour over everything. Lucky for all concerned, the marvellous product that is Bisto exists. I'm English (but have lived in the US for the past several years) and am very happy that this product is reasonably easy to obtain over here. My American husband is an enormous fan and starts to get a bit worried if we don't have at least one unopened tub of Bisto in the cupboard, lest he should want bangers & mash or toad in the hole for dinner and find we're unable to make enough gravy to float a small boat to accompany it.<br /><br />Bisto does come in a few different varieties, but these ""favourite"" granules are the original and work really well as an all-purpose gravy. I prefer to use this version no matter what meat I'm cooking - it works just as well with chicken or turkey as it does with beef or with pork sausages, and it's an essential ingredient in shepherd's pie (lamb), cottage pie (beef), steak ""pot"" pie (as they call it over here), you can throw a spoonful in the crockpot when making a stew... it's very versatile and adds a lovely rich, deep flavor to all kinds of dishes.<br /><br />When making gravy, you can have a jug of the stuff ready within a couple of minutes if you do it the easy way (boil kettle, pour boiling water over a couple of spoonfuls of Bisto granules, stir quickly) but for REALLY good gravy I prefer to soften some onion and garlic in a little butter (just let it sweat over a low heat in a covered pan) until it caramelises slightly, then dump in the Bisto granules and boiling water, give it a good stir, and you will have some heavenly gravy ready to go. Only takes a few minutes. Even better is if you use the water from boiling vegetables and stir in meat juices from the roasting pan if you have some, but it works just as well without.<br /><br />The downside of this product (if you care about such things) is that it's pretty high on the sodium content and has a few artificial flavorings etc in there. As far as I'm concerned: meh. It tastes great, I'm sparing with the salt just about everywhere else in my diet, and I don't use Bisto in great enough quantities to worry about it.<br /><br />In short: Bisto is a wonderful taste of home, and while I could live without it, I'd really rather not!"
"Costco stopped carrying this near me, so when I found out it was on amazon for cheaper, I was so excited.<br /><br />It came pretty quick, was at an unbeatable price, and was the same good hot cereal I got from the Costco (no damage or anything)."
"I have always loved Lipton teas. It is a daily habit.  I just bought a automatic tea brewer and loose tea for the first time.  Almost immediately I started getting an upset stomach.  It never occured to me that it could be the tea.  I have never had a problem like this.  After a week of stomach problems, and tring different solutions I finally stopped drinking the tea.  Immediately my stomach was better.  A few days later I started drinking the Lipton loose tea again and immediately my stomach was upset.  I looked on the internet and a few suggested I add a bit of honey and a bit of salt.  I tried that with no success.  Does anyone else have any ideas?  I hate to throw out six boxes of tea."
"This is a very dangerous product. It is not labeled as to identify ""Pepsin: A name for several enzymes secreted by the stomach to break down protein; An enzyme produced in the stomach that splits proteins into peptones; Also used as coagulant, comes from the stomach of the pigs; An enzyme from pigs' stomachs, used with rennet to make cheese."" I flushed my money down the toilet - don't be fooled by the Pure Fun Organic Candy Pepsin Swirl Mint Pinwheels - These are horrid and made me sick. I allowed a 7 year old to have one (thinking it was exactly as the package was labeled) CANDY. Stay away from Pepsin Swirl which in my opinion is fraud and the FDA needs to investigate this product."
"I found the tarallini to be crumbly and have an unpleasant stale taste. My previous experience with tarallini was different, they were crunchier and not crumbly. Whether this is a specific mediterranean recipe, I don't know, but I would not buy this product again."
"I have arthritis and have searched for a decent coffee replacement for years.  The Maya Chocolate hits the spot. The chicory gives it the bitter note needed, the toasted almonds add depth, while the chocolate tempers the chicory and adds fullness to the flavor. Whoa. Sounds like I am reviewing a great coffee...LOL! Good Stuff Manard, give it a go!"
I usually order Bustelo Decaffeinated coffee and I am used to the taste being the same as regular espresso. I tried this Lavazza decaf espresso and I am extremely disappointed. It's really obvious when you taste it that it is decaffeinated and tastes like it is processed. I ordered the 4-pack and would really like to send back the three that I haven't opened yet if I can do that...
"Seriously, this is the worst tasting grape juice I've ever ingested.  Tastes like it's 2/3 water and 1/3 grape juice.  Talk about a misleading label!  Says 100% juice.  I would beg to differ.  For reference, I've drank many brands of grape juice from the obvious Welch's to any old store brand.  The kicker is on the label there's a gold medal this was awarded for superior taste.<br /><br />Don't waste you money on this.  Would never buy again."
"I FOUND EMERILS COFFEE TO BE ONE OF THE BEST TASTING COFFEE IF YOU LIKE A BOLD COFFEE,,I ALWAYS KEEP THIS PRODUCT IN MY HOME,,"
"Personally, would cut the added butter or vegetable oil by 1/2 but that is a personal taste.  Would buy again.  As I said, IKEA carries this mix."
"I HAVE TO SAY IN THE BEGINNING..I HAVE NOT TRIED THIS FOOD, IT HAD ME SOLD. I SAID OH BOY! ITS MADE BY PAUL NEWMAN IT ""HAS"" TO BE GOOD! THIS SHOULD ""NOT BE CATARIZED ""ORGANIC""!! ITS DECEITFUL.

This is our favorite flavor of all of the Keurig choices. Just enough kick but still relatively mild.  Great price too!
"These are genuine Greenies product, not a knockoff.  My dogs love them!  It is their favorite treat.  I have 2 small dogs, both under 10 lbs. and the Teenie size is perfect for them.  I paid $22.37 for this 96-pack and it is by far the best price I have found anywhere.  I wish these were part of the Subscribe & Save program."
"I was not satisfied AT FIRST with this product.  After posting a less than glowing review, I was immediately contacted by the seller (distributor).  They graciously sent a new ""fresher"" bag of coffee.  This is much closer to what I remember.  Try with sweetened condensed milk as suggested, it is served that way in Jamaica.  Now if I only had some coco bread to go with it.<br /><br />Thank you for the prompt, courteous service."
"I have tried a variety of K-Cups for my Keurig Brewer and find Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend works best for me in taste.  I shop Amazon when offers are available including free shipping.  Amazon has been a good source for buying various items, including books, and I recommend them highly.  Delivery is as promised as well as products reliability."
Taste is similar to regular potato chips but without the guilt of eating something so bad for you.  They make a great snack.  Bags are a little lite but if you eat a couple of bags it should satisfy.
"This is a purely smooth and silky soup, not a bean or veggie chunk to be found. I loved the consistency actually; it was like a light cream rather than a starchy thick soup. But, I can never leave well enough alone. I saut&eacute;ed three sweet carrots in 1 teaspoon of oil, then added the soup to heat, and served it up with some chopped avocado. The combination was delightful.<br /><br />The soup on its own had a wonderful taste and just the right amount of flavor in terms of heat (not too much!), spices, and salt. Nothing was over the top, and it all melded rather nicely. There was just one note that kept tasting ""off"" to me. It was mostly in the aftertaste, so it didn't deter me from devouring the bowl. Nonetheless, it left me curious, so I checked the ingredients and finally spotted the culprit ... cilantro paste. Yes, I am one of those cilantro supertasters who generally dislike it. Cilantro fans will find this soup spot on, but luckily, the cilantro is far enough down the ingredient list that even most ""cilantro tastes like soap"" people (such as me) will enjoy it.<br /><br />I will purchase this soup again either for a quick lunch, or as a recipe starter ... it has great potential! Plus, I love that it is both dairy-free and soy-free."
"I've ordered most of the cheaper Tea's Etc add on teas and all have been great both in terms of flavor AND value. I cold brew using disposable tea filters closed with toothpicks in <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004TJ3ZUA"">Takeya Airtight Drink Maker Pitcher / Jug, Set of Two</a> and it works wonderfully. (Those jugs are great, even better if you can still find them half price at Costco.)<br /><br />I found this tea to be of very good quality and certainly not ""fishy"" smelling at all as another reviewer notes. The small pebbles are tightly rolled and very uniform with a nice shine to them. These are the things too look for in a good quality gunpowder tea.<br /><br />This tea has a great flavor: grassy yet peppery and I've found it to be excellent blended with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007B9UI1Y"">Tea's Etc Organic Black Tea, Mint Fusion, 3-Ounce</a>."
"Our three Chihuahuas love this treat and it is good for them (especially the 14 yr. old), but it is expensive in the stores.  I am so glad to have found it at Amazon at a much lower price!"
"I found an excellent infuser and loose leaf Earl Grey all in the same day. This may become my daily tea. Does well on a 2nd steeping- still smooth and slightly smokey, not at all bitter tea flavor comes through nicely with maybe a bit less bergamot zing than the first time, still very tasty. You can really tell the difference on teas like this one which use real bergamot, especially of good quality. And a decent black tea is often missing in even some of Earl Greys with good bergamot, which is sometimes used to hide inferior leaves. Rishi included high quality in both departments, so the tea carries through on its own even after the spicy citrus does its work. It may be a bit strong for some, and I wouldn't know what is considered better from a traditional point of view (I'm not British), but it's just right for me. My favorite Earl Grey to date."
"Here's a tiny consolation: easy Thai barbecued chicken! Cut your usual fryer in quarters, cook it slowly over charcoal or quickly in a hot oven, and then brush it generously with ""sweet chili sauce"" and cook it just a few minutes more. Most authentic with 'sticky' rice but also delicious with brown or red rice.<br /><br />In Thailand, people squat over hibachi-sized braziers on the sidewalks and sell portion of this sort of barbecued chicken. Sometimes they trot alongside inter-city buses as they pull into stations, and sell chicken through the windows. Don't be squeamish! This is a treat you'll remember. The same sauce will enhance the flavor of any fowl from blackbird to condor or whooping crane."
"Even though the item says ""Pack of 6,"" I only received one. I called them up to see where the other 5 were, and they said that Amazon put it incorrectly. Seriously?? They are issuing a refund, but still. I wanted 6, which is what the item says, and instead and only getting the 1. Should we just not trust what's on Amazon now???"
"Unfortunately the Hershey bars arrived melted and i had to throw them out. The special ""packing"" was completely melted and, naturally, did not preserve the candy. It was a somewhat expensive lesson for me to learn. I did notify the seller but never heard back from anyone."
I purchased this popcorn for my Nostalgia retro popcorn machine hoping that I would be able to produce movie theatre quality popcorn at home.  The seller describes this as the best popcorn available and I have to agree that it really lives up to the hype!  The popcorn comes out delicious every time-- the perfect balance of butteriness and salt.  I tried using popcorn kernels and all kinds of different oils before I bought this product.  I will never use anything other than this popcorn!  The only problem is that I have eaten 10 of 24 packages-- and I've only had it for two weeks!
WARNING !!!!!  they don't even make there own food it is licensed out to another company if you look on the back of the bag it doesn't even list who it is made by it only says guaranteed by canidae and when i asked who it was made by i was<br /><br />1 either completely ignored<br /><br />2 given a huge run around only thing i ever got was a state it was made in they wouldn't even tell me the company<br /><br />this is dangerous because this is how all the pet food recalls happened a few years ago by out sourcing manufacturing
"I ordered this product at the same time as the Kirkland Signature salmon.  The Raincoast Trading Co. salmon is very tasty, equally as good quality salmon as the Kirkland.  However, the Raincoast arrived in perfect condition, the Kirkland cans were dented badly.  I recommend this product to anyone who likes boneless skinless canned salmon."
"I am in love with this tea. Every other apple cinnamon tea I've tried has been too cinnamon-y. This is the perfect blend. It tastes like apple cider without all the sugar, which I love. I recommend this tea to anyone who wants a low-cal version of apple cider."
"Since the factory burned down that made Firecracker brand pickled sausage I have had to get by with the individually packaged version which doesn't remotely taste like the kind I grew up with, not to mention they are half the size.  These are the best pickled sausages I've had since my last jar of Firecrackers a couple years ago.  I saw the crappy review and I had to show my support.  As a person who grew up on these things I definitely know what I'm talking about.  If you want burn your mouth out hot then look elsewhere but if you want the best tasting pickled sausage on the market currently look no further!"
"The variety packs taste great!<br /><br />I have them every morning. At $0.30 cents per meal, I don't understand why everyone on earth isn't buying this stuff up.<br /><br />Maple and brown sugar is terrific, followed by apples and cinnamon, followed by regular. You don't get tired of the same ole thing, and they taste great.<br /><br />I just boil water from a small pot, empty the packet or 2 in a bowl, pour in boiling water, and watch it expand to 2x its size!<br /><br />Taste really good and takes minutes to prepare.<br /><br />Not sure why everyone on earth isn't this. Convenient, healthy, very quick, excellent quality, and extremely cheap..."
THis is a fantastic flavored tea.  We are addicted to it.  We add a little vanilla soy milk and it's like having desert.  Just wonderful.  Highly recommend this tea!!!!!!!
"They melt in your mouth!  I think I found my perfect snack.<br />I love Oreos, but hate all the fat they provide to my diet.  By diet I mean the ability to eat everything in moderation.  I monitor how much fat I ingest for many reasons, health being the most important.  One package of these cookies had the same great taste of oreos with only 1/4 of the fat.<br />I also like the fact that they come in individual packages:  They don't go stale;  you can take them on trips, movies, park, etc.<br />Great tea or coffee cookies too!.... and, of course, good old milk."
"I live in a sparsely populated state, and due to the low volume of gluten-free products, what is available in our stores costs about double what you pay on Amazon.com.  This Sam Mills Pasta D'Oro is very tasty and I don't think the average person would know it was gluten-free if you didn't tell them.  It also holds it shape very well and doesn't fall apart after it is cooked.  Sam Mills pastas will now become a staple in my cupboards.  Thanks, Amazon.com, for making this line of products available to us at a reasonable price."
"My girls seem to like this food - they've only ever shown an opposition to green beans.  But it is SO messy.  It's apparently tomato-based, and it gets everywhere.  Where we usually just wipe their faces gently, you really have to clean them.  It simply turns their skin orange.  And the bowls and spoon end up crazy oily, even after soaking."
I haven't purchased this product but wanted to post because it is misleading.<br /><br />Cream of tartar is the salt of tartaric acid.  Cream of tartar is used for baking.  If you are trying to make mascarpone cheese you need tartaric acid!
"The Switch Kiwi Berry carbonated fruit juice tasted good, but it was too sweet and had too many calories for my liking. I could drink a regular can of soda. Going forward, I probably would not buy this beverage because I do not like to drink that many calories (135) or sugar (33 grams) in one sitting."
The pineapple coconut combination is refreshing. I especially like that there is no added sugar. This is a welcomed change from other brands.
"Great packaging, and a great product. My cat definitely approved of the variety pack of fish flavored cat food. He was a little hesitant at first, but once he tasted it he was very happy. I would recommend this to anyone with a cat having a taste for fish."
"Delicate ground hazelnut cookies for a Ladies tea, NOT for children or most men! Appreciated only by sophisticated palates, because they are neither cloyingly sweet or fatty. Set these aside for unexpected guests you'd like to impress."
"Some of these are quite tasty, but all are too salty. Way too much sodium.<br />The cheddar flavor is kind of like different-shaped cheetos, quite tasty.<br />Parmesan garlic on the other hand is terrible. Extremely garlicky with no parmesan taste at all, and too salty."
I race homing pigeons and raw spanish peanuts are the best source of great protein and fat.  These peanuts are the best bulk quality I have ever seen!
"use to be a regular customer of this product on the subscribe and save program, a little over $17 with free shipping,<br />that was outstanding in my book and encouraged repeat orders to say the least, the product was as shown and delivered<br />in a reasonable time frame, the product rates a 5 star but have to give the price a negative -3(off the charts), for a final rating of 2 star, as the current price is beyond Pluto, if you know what i mean!"
"Pops up light and fluffy, and tastes just like what you get at the theatre.  If you have purchased a home popcorn machine as we have, you will appreciate the convenience of the pre-measured packets.  No guess work involved; just great popcorn every time.  We buy it by the case in 4oz and 8oz packages.  This way if it's just my husband and myself, we make a 4oz package, and if we have company over, we can use the 8oz.  I'm sure it would be cheaper to get plain popcorn and oil, but this is well worth the cost, and isn't the popcorn what you like about going to the movies anyway?"
"I have tried about 25 different K-Cup flavors, and this is my favorite.  It has a wonderful aroma, and just the right amount of Hazelnut.  Use the subscribe option, and this is a deal that can't be beat."
GROVE STREET HAS THE ABSOLUTE BEST HOT CHOCOLATE FOR THE KEURIG.  YOU SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE HOT CHOCOLATE AVAILABLE TO SOOTHE AWAY THE DAYS ANXIETIES!
"My mother used to make pork with shake n bake quite a lot and I loved it then and rediscovered it here! It cooks in 15 minutes at 425 degrees in the oven, which is the quickest oven meal I've made.  Shake 'n Bake makes the pork crispy and stays pretty crispy as a left over.  If you haven't tried it please do, it will be on your regular menu for a long time."
"My 8-month old son is not the picky eater my first was. He had only refused one flavor of all the baby foods introduced to him in 3 months (and it was peas-can't blame him for that one) but he REFUSED to swallow the Rice & Lentil flavor in this variety pack. He actually spit it back out and then blew raspberries (cute, but messy). I tried several times over 2 weeks and got the same response each time. We will not be ordering this pack again even though he loved each of the other meals."
Great coffee brewed very quickly.  Two brew settings allows for one cup as well as one mug.  Hot water for tea or other hot beverages.
"I make a great Watergate Salad (from the Jell-O website)with this product, and it is all sugar-free.  I leave out the marshmallows, and I use pineapple packed in its own juice and sugar-free Cool Whip.  My diabetic friends rave over this dessert and the non-diabetic friends love it also!  The pudding mixes easily with the liquids and is never pasty.  This is really a great product."
"So far I'm not impressed with this popcorn. It's tender when popped, but it's really annoying how much doesn't pop. I'm going to add a little water and then let it sit, closed up, for a while and see if that helps. As of right now, I wouldn't buy this popcorn again."
"We've been buying this coffee for over a year on the once a month plan, and still love it !. Never mind the ""Five pounds is a lot of coffee, and it will lose it's taste after three or four weeks'"" It lasts us about five weeks, and it's still as good as it was at the start; at least to us less sophisticated coffee drinkers. And we also tried buying it direct from the roaster, following one review comment that it was much fresher that way; B.S., Back to Amazon; the price is less, shipping is reliable, and the coffee is just as fresh, and just as good. After years of looking, it's our favorite coffee, from what has become our favorite vendor. It's just the right roast, just between french roast and the weak stuff, and forgiving enough to make a mistake with the brew time or the water and still be acceptable. But as stated earlier, We're not nearly expert enough to make the really critical fine point judgements.<br />Terry and Judy Hedgecock<br />Rural Arizona"
My wife is gluten and dairy intolerant and we have found that buying flours online is much cheaper than at the stores.
"The rice flour in it is a crude gritty grade (cheap?). If you've ever used Thai rice flour <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EYC096"">Thai Rice Flour - 16 oz</a>, you know that rice flour does not need to be this unpleasantly gritty.<br /><br />I tried compensating for the grit by using Bisquick Gluten Free to make Johnny cakes since the cornmeal is sort of gritty. But sadly, after you chew you are still left with this unpleasant grit like fine sand in your mouth."
"These are quite tasty and delicious, I love them....BUT the prices here are RIDICULOUS!!! Did I say Ridiculous? Oh So RIDICULOUS!!! But Im here to rate the product not the price...5 Stars for the Product."
"This blended flour is wonderful for those on a GF diet and works well in baked goods, giving a richness without excessive coconut flavor. To determine if this product is right for you, it is important to consider how you plan to use it.  If you are looking to add a little fiber to smoothies or sauces or soups, you may want 100% coconut flour. If you are wanting it for flavorful baked goods recipes with fiber, this should work perfectly! If you are making your own flour blend and wanting a flour that will not effect blood sugar so much, this is not what you need.<br /><br />If you read the reviews elsewhere on Amazon for pure 100% coconut flours--which this product is not--you will find some users were expecting the benefits of coconut flour with the ease of all-purpose wheat flour. There are good reasons for blending other flours with coconut flour:coconut flour alone can be difficult and expensive to use because it requires a lot of liquid--usually in the form of eggs and oils--to make a recipe work properly. This product ""Gluten Free Mama, Mama's Coconut Blend Flour"" has solved some of that problem by blending in other flours.  If you are trying to avoid carbs, this likely is not the flour for you. HOWEVER, if like me you are trying to avoid gluten while also adding fiber in your diet, this may be exactly what you seek. Note again, this is a blend of several flours, so if you did not catch the word ""blend"" in the description above as some reviewers did not, take note. Each of the flours in the blend brings something to the table, but if you seek the benefits of 100% coconut flour, look elsewhere on Amazon--but before purchasing it do read the reviews from people who expected it to work like all-purpose flour in their baking. (Most of the poor reviews for both products are not the fault of the product but of the purchasers.)"
It doesn't get any better than this in the a.m.  Brew .. sit back .. sip .. and ENJOY!
"I have been searching for a tasty gluten-free cookie cookie for several years, a taste that was equal to the cookies of regular eating days.  Lucy's Oatmeal Cookies ended the quest.  They are DELICIOUS!!! They are also a perfect size for a quick snack and ever so satisfying.  The calorie content is also good.  I am anxious to try other varieties."
"Everyone loved these pretzels. Very flavorful, not too salty. I plan on buying more from Amazon, best price I've found on this brand."
"You can order the same products online from Nespresso for approx $25 AND you can specify exactly what you want to buy rather than taking a mixture of items, some of which you may not like.<br /><br />Nespresso makes GREAT coffee and GREAT machines. The Nespresso capsule offers posted on Amazon however are all by third parties who prey on people who don't know better."
I ordered this because the title says ice cream and food sticks...I received all ice cream. I don't have time to mess with a return. Change the title if it's assorted ice cream.
"I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections.  I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food (with water added to it) and Uri Ease.  The combination seems to keeps his UTI's under control.  If I switch to another type of dry food, his UTI gets worse.  The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well.  It's expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me."
"This was purchased as a ""Warehouse Deal"" and there was a noticable lack of aroma when opening the package.  I do not know if it had just been sitting aroung too long (brew by 3/5/11 on package) or if the lack of flavor/character is normal for this product.  Two stars because it is still drinkable but boring."
I bought this coffee because several people who also liked my favorite (Jet Fuel or Emeril's Big Intense Bold) liked this one. Typically Sumatra is one of my favorite coffees as well.<br /><br />I am wondering if they made a bad batch or gave it the wrong label.<br />It is **NOT** bold.  It is extremely mild and smoky tasting.  Not a single member of my family liked it and that's very unusual.<br /><br />I'm going to contact the company to see if they'll exchange it or refund me.  It is THAT bad.
I thought this would be fantastic to keep my puppy busy but she just chewed the knob off the rope insert (ours was rubber) and that was that.  She won't play with it at all.  She is highly food motivated but this just doesn't do it for her.  Give her a Bully Stick and that's really something though!
This is one of the best K cups out there. Nice bold flavor.No bitter after taste. If you want a bold K cup try this!
"With all the rave reviews, coupled with the fact that these pre-packs include all the right ingredients, I assumed the  result would be at least 75% authentic carnival style popcorn for my popcorn maker. After all, I have used packs like this for over 10 years (at a previous employers Ag Equipment business), of which was amazing!  This product is not. On a scale of 1-10, I'd rate it about a 2. It is edible; although extremely salty. Tastes nothing like carnival style popcorn, severely lacking in butter flavor. The only positive aspect of this product is the convenience in the pack itself. So if you're used to buying cheap jiffy-pop, over the stove style popcorn, this would be better. I Would not recommend."
"We give this toy with a cup of food in it for our five month old dobie.  It took him a very short time to figure it out, but now knows if he turns it upside down the food comes out.  Now our dinner times are enjoyable for everyone!  He does use it as a chew toy also, but a word of warning:  As I was inspecting the bottle the other day, I noticed that the screw off bottom was cracked on the side (it has spent ALOT of time being used as a molar teething toy).  We will definitely be getting another one!"
"I've tried different foods with my puppies. This is the only brand that they actually seem to enjoy. i've tried science hills diet, purina puppy chow, and Iams. Finally, I decided that I needed to find something that didn't have all sorts of fillers in it. So I decided to try Canidae. Not only do I know that they will eat it right away but it produces a lot less poop. With all the other kinds of food we would see it just sit there for hours and hours. Plus, Purina gave them the stinkiest, biggest, most icky poop. With this, their poop have gotten a lot smaller and they do not need to go as much.<br /><br />I had seen some stuff online though at first stating that it caused their dogs to be sick and I was worried about feeding them it the first time. However, I've had no problems so I think it was just a bad batch not too long ago. They are both doing great and I think this is the best filler-less food for the price."
"Good price, free delivery, automatic replenishment, cats love it (it's the only reason they come in) - a fine deal! (I'm a little worried, though that they'll get tire of this flavor - maybe another option with mixed flavors?)"
"Good idea but the company should use a better soil compound.  Maybe darker.  It's hard to tell if the soil is wet or dry.  Present compound blows away when I water it.  Finally sprouted and I'll transpant to a regular top soil when it grows more.  At least with soil, you can tell when it's dry.  Right now, I will give it small amounts of water weekly until that happens.  Very disappointed with this product."
"I really enjoyed the smoked sausages, it took me nearly 3 weeks to finish.  But I would definitely purchase this again.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026WL13U"">Oh Boy! Oberto Cocktail Pep Smoked Sausage Sticks, 3.8-Pound Package</a>"
"Hello, I don't plan on using this particular item. In viewing this item at the time of purchase it didn't appear that any of the yellow plastic caps came loose.The picture made it appear all the caps stayed in the cups and twirled around. Then the instructions warn not to leave your dog alone with this toy. My whole purpose was to leave my dog alone and I wouldn't have to worry about any of the plastic caps coming loose. Actually, I'm sorry I bought it. However, I bought two of the squirrels in the tree trunk toys, one for me and one for a friend, and we're very happy with them."
"Original review -- I thought I had purchased salt with almonds in it. The amount of salt is RIDICULOUS and very unhealthy. Almonds are a healthy snack but not if they are this salty.<br /><br />UPDATE -- I contacted the company and they provided a replacement. The new bag was perfect, the almonds were tasty and not too salty. It seems that I purchased a bag from a bad batch. The company was prompt at correcting the problem. I originally gave the product a 1 star rating, I'm updating the review and giving the product 4 stars."
"I have been using this Tuscan blend on my salad for years. The best recipe that I have for this blend is Angle Hair Pasta, olive oil and a heavy hand of this seasoning. Then a bit of Parmesan cheese on top of it all. My favorite meal. I go through 10 of these tins a year..."
"Terrific flavor, good crisp texture and just the right amount of sugar sprinkles make this a winner! Lucy's cookies are my go - to<br />dessert."
"I know the price varies for stage 1 foods but sometimes they are a lot cheaper on amazon then in the stores. I wasn't sure how many were in the package so I decided to just buy one.  There are 8 packs of 2 in this package so for the price, you are getting 16 containers.  I personally wasn't sure if I was getting a great price or paying slightly  more then if I went to the supermarket.  I like these gerber containers of baby food.  It's easier to get the food out, they do make some organic varieties, and you seem to get almost double the amount of food for the same price as jars.  If you only use half the lid snaps back on easy like a desposible food container."
"Love this pasta.  I mix this with regular pasta for a meal, half and half.  Love the lower calories and the fiber content."
Each filter pack is perfect for brewing 4 cups of coffee. This is that great Maxwell House flavor from filter packs that are incredibly easy to use. My coffee making skills are very limited and I get compliments on my coffee now! Highly recommended
"This drink contends to be a natural alternative to soda.  While it definitely is ""natural"", I would not agree with the ""alternative to soda"" aspect.  Specifically, the liquid is much closer in consistency to juice, and in fact, has more sugar than juice (over 30 grams per 8.3 ounces).  Sure, it's lightly carbonated, but that alone doesn't make this drink a soda.  Also, if you wanted something natural, I'd go with Hansen's sodas, or a number of natural sodas, which are definitely sodas.  This drink is basically juice with carbonation.<br /><br />The other notable issue I had with this was its size.  8.3 oounces doesn't get you far (3 gulps, maybe?), and coupled with the thickness of the drink (since it IS juice, with quite a bit of natural sugar), you don't get very much thirst quenching effect from this.  The 100% juice also accounts for the strong aftertaste.<br /><br />Finally, natural sugar is still sugar, and has just as many calories.  This stuff wouldn't make the cut in most school vending policies, with its high sugar content.  And I wouldn't give this to my kids.  Instead, a couple of CapriSun Roaring Waters juice pouches (which each have about 1/4 the amount of sugar) would do the trick for them.<br /><br />Not recommended, sorry."
"Green Mountain is our favorite coffee.  We switched from grinding our own to K cups recently.  We still love Vermont Country Blend and Heifer Hope, but this is the ultimate K-cup for us.  A medium roast, rich but not bitter.  It satisfies every time."
"I was so disappointed in this coffee. I guess I was fooled by the ""Oooh it's more expensive than the others, there must be something special to it! I have to try it once!""I never get taken in by price!! There was absolutely nothing to it that was any better than other K cups from other brands that sell Colombian coffee. Don't waste your money on it, not worth it..."
"I was really disappointed in these olives. The are very mushy and I prefer a more firm texture. Cat Cora's olives are much, much better."
I've been eating better for a year and lost 70lbs.  I was looking for new ideas and found this.  I have used so far in my morning protein shake...just a 1/2 to 1 teaspoon is plenty.  Really great flavor.  I will buy this again.
"These jelly beans were very unusual when they showed up.  They came in a package without a jelly belly logo, the jelly beans themselves had no jelly belly logo, and I don't really know if they were actually jelly bellys.  I got them as a gift, so I didn't try any of them, but it was odd giving a gift where it didn't seem like they were anything special, like I'd bagged up some licorice jelly beans from the grocery store or something, big woop...so I was disappointed.  And because they were a gift I had no idea what they tasted like.  So were they really jelly bellys?  Who knows?  I felt silly giving them though."
"These have a great crunch and it's great that it's low fat. However, it's way too salty. 280mg per serving is more than twice the amount of regular flavor chips like Lays. The cheddar and sour cream and onion flavor is delicious but also way too salty and too much sodium for my taste buds or health."
"First, I'll give the manufacturer some credit for making a no-additive, sucralose-only product. The problem with this product is: it's just too weak, in flavor that is. 1 gram of this ""pure sucralose"" tastes about as strong as 1 gram of a Splenda packet, for comparison.<br />If you don't mind spending a lot for a little bit of pure sucralose taste, then maybe this is for you, but cost-conscious customers might want to look elsewhere for a no-carb, non-calorie sweetener."
"If you want to try something different, this is a very exotic and refreshing tea with with many benefits for the body! The box arrived intact."
"For the price, this is:<br /><br />organic<br />taste great<br />pure maple<br />grade A<br />competitive price<br /><br />I wish when reviewers criticize products they would direct us to the better product, but some people seem to only want to be negative really negative.<br /><br />I like the info, but not the tone as well as no comment that there is (what is it) or is not a better option."
"I ordered these last month. Of the first six I've tried, five have blown open and spewed coffee grounds all over our machine (as well as in the cup). I'm getting rather tired of cleaning the Keurig. Normally, I buy our K-cups at local department store but buying in bulk here at Amazon was less expensive. Amazon has graciously replaced the first lot and I was told if this second lot has the same problems, to call them back and they will need to look at pulling the lot. After looking back at the reviews for this product, I think that would be a wise move considering many of us are having the same problem. Thankfully, Amazon's customer service is 5-star so I haven't lost my money."
"Puroast has a great thing going for people who need reduced-acid foods. I've been ordering directly from Puroast for about a year, but I'm really glad to see their product is catching on and their distribution is getting more aggressive. I was even able to find it in my local supermarket a couple weeks ago when I suddenly ran out of my Puroast mocha java.<br /><br />My wife stopped drinking coffee a couple of years ago because the acid helped contribute to discomfort she had due to IC (interstitial cystitis). She began drinking only peppermint tea as a hot drink, and that, along with some other dietary changes, helped her a lot. I also had some problems with urinary tract discomfort as well as stomach acid discomfort, but I couldn't stop drinking hot coffee cold turkey (LOL) and read about Puroast. I tried it and it has become a staple in my daily diet: one large cup a day. Recently, my wife decided to try a cup every now and then, and so far she hasn't had any problems at all due to acid.<br /><br />The coffee tastes full-bodied even though Puroast does something proprietary to reduce the acid in the coffee. The French Roast has plenty of rich coffee taste. I happen to prefer more of a medium roast, but that's just me. All the Puroast coffee varieties that I've tried are plenty good enough for me--with the distinct benefit of low acid. You can get beans or two different grinds, and they sell the coffee in small packets as well as 1-lb, 2-lb and even up to 5-lb bags. They also have flavored coffees, like the mocha java I mentioned above.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great find and a great addition to Amazon's product lines for people who would like to enjoy the foods and drinks they like but need a reduced-acid alternative. Highly recommended!"
"The seller was prompt to ship, I receive the disposable K-cup in two days. When I receive them, I try one of the disposable K-cup on Keig, the ease of use and the quality of the cup it made and the saving from pre-fill K-cup coffee brands is worth the price."
"I found this muffin to be dry and very disappointing. If I cut it up and put it in a bowl with yogurt, it was OK. Would not order this flavor again."
"I wouldn't call these almonds sweet, but they do have just the right hint of sweet flavor that the almond is elevated and feels like a treat.  The taste and texture of almonds doesn't particularly appeal to me, but they're such a healthy snack that I'm glad to find this delicious option.  Also, the small container is the perfect size to have on your desk or keep in the car, or use as stocking stuffers like I plan to do for a couple of my healthy eating conscious friends!"
We made this purchase based on our daughter's recommendation and it is as good as she promised. We have a new flip-style waffle iron and this mix provides us with a wonderful breakfast. We add fresh strawberries or blueberries to the top along with syrup and it is scrumdiddlyumptous!
"When I first started to use IAMS Savory Sauce, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get a little drizzle in their kibble every once in a while, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it once in a blue moon when it is on sale because of it contains vitamins and its decently priced, and low calorie. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of IAMS Savory Sauce, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining. VitaGravy is a similar product that contains more vitamins, so if your must have some sort of gravy, I recommend VitaGravy a bit more. Or you can also just mix in some warm water with your dog food and let it sit for a bit before you feed it to your dog. This creates a ""gravy"" like texture and aroma that most dogs love. Not the greatest idea if your dog has dental issues, but a great free solution for picky eaters."
"Tried these on our two Schnauzers----they were impressed!  These are rather large biscuits that are made to break in half which makes them a perfect size for a snack or reward.  They have a good crunch which I think is good for dental health.  Anyway, I have a box of Alpo Variety Snacks and a box of Milk Bone Flavor Snacks to which I compared ingredients.  They both have artificial color, Alpo lists animal digest, whatever that is, while Milk Bone won the contest with all of those ingredients that no one can pronounce.  I would list what makes up all three but think it would not be too interesting and you probably have at least one of the listed brands if you give your pet treats.<br />What sets the Newman's Own apart is the simple list of Organic ingredients including lamb, carrots, apples, molasses, barley and tocopherols for Vitamin E.  It is made in New Zealand where they raise a lot of lamb, so this seems just the perfect place. The bottom line is our dogs think Pa and Nell Newman have a great product and would highly recommend it to their four legged friends.  Life could not be better than living with happy dogs.  So, on their input I must give this product a five star rating."
I totally love POPCHIPS - but the Sea Salt and Vinegar just has too much Vinegar taste for me.  I felt like I was eating just vinegar.  I took the rest to work and some people like the flavor and some said just to much vinegar for them.
"I have several different ways of connecting XLR microphones to my computers for use in webinars, and I thought this design would be simpler to transport and connect, but when I tried to use it with a Shure SM58 mic the volume it produced was about 25% of what I am used to, and was not adequate for my purpose."
"My little Schipperke could hardly walk in the morning because her hips hurt so much.  Even though she is only two, we worried that she would need surgery to get around.  We started her on Happy Hips and in less than two weeks, she was a pup again... running around and enjoying life.  And, she runs to the kitchen in the morning to beg for her ""treat"" because she loves the taste.  What a great product.  Thank you so much."
"I used to get these instore and found a cheaper deal on Amazon. I recently realize when you open the bag, there's a strong smell (like plastic or chemicals). I tried a little bit myself and the smell is just so strong that I can't bear it. I tossed everything everything away and would not buy this again.<br />It's made in China. You don't know what they put in the chicken strips to get them addicted or .... sick.<br />AVOID!"
"Tried this coffee while working an early morning job. It was one of the best coffees I have ever tried. The flavor is warm and strong, and I left me wanting more than just one cup. I go to Starbucks all the time, and I honestly thought this coffee was better :) definitely recommend!"
"If you want a truly healthy, filling snack, you must give these a try, as well as their sisters, the Vanilla Bean Almonds. They are both just lightly sweetened, and fragrant with either the cinnamon or the vanilla, depending on which you choose. The container is marvelous; there is a half flip top which is easy to do with one hand (like in the car). And they're not roasted in more oil, so the almonds are ""meaty"" and sweet. And almonds are SOOO good for you. I'd recommend that you try them, and then get an Amazon subscribe and save if you can. It's well worth it! And all natural. LOVELY!"
"I have to wonder about the leadership of this company.  There's a review here from 2007 complaining about no safety seal and obviously no one at the company with the power to change that thinks it's a big deal.  I bought this at my local grocery store.  When I got home and opened it without the lid popping, I took it right back to the store and got my money back.  I was going to call the company but there is no phone number on the label.  Get this--it says if you have questions or comments about the product to WRITE to them.  Ok, sure.  Bet they don't get many questions or comments...which apparently is how they like it."
"This product makes a great gift!  Not only are the cookies delicious, but the tin is attractive and of good quality.  Highly recommended."
"I did get a good laugh out of my one bone that I had ordered thinking I was getting a cute basket of bones for the 130.49 value .So do not let the picture deceive you as It did me.SO this item is so not worth it .<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000IHXML4"">Merrick Smoked Beefy Jerky Bone 2-3""</a>"
Excellent product.  Crab Cakes made with lump style crabmeat has been a family tradition during Christmas holidays for over 40 years.  Local grocery stores do not carry lump style and only offer fancy/minced crab meat which is OK but not as satisfatory as lump style.
"This is an awesome product. For those who can't digest cows milk, this is an awesome replacement. It has all the nutrients you need and is low in calories and the taste is superb. I use it in baking and cooking with the added flavors of vanilla and coconut, it's a real treat. Really adds flavor to protein drinks, too.  The aseptic packs are great for camping and taking on the road if you have no refrigeration available."
"I'm a big Pamela's fan and this bread mix does not disappoint.  It rises and bakes nicely every time, forming a delicious brown crust.  Important to note is that the bread does come out a bit sweeter than I remember regular wheat bread tasting when I used to bake it.  But I have used this bread for garlic bread, sandwiches - you name it - and it's fantastic!  My kids love it for grilled cheese.<br /><br />The first time I baked it, I made it in a bread maker and I remember being unimpressed - it seemed too moist and dense.  But I tried mixing it in my stand mixer and baking it in the oven (which, by the way, was hardly any more work that just throwing it into the bread machine) and it has come out perfect every time.  I've done the cinnamon bread variation on the back of the package (which I made into french toast... yum) and also made bagels with this mix.  All turned out very well.  The bagels, while a little labor intensive with the boiling, were tender and delicious (and made fantastic roasted red pepper and herbed cream cheese sandwiches).  Purchasing this with Amazon's subscribe and save will save you a lot of money... you can't go wrong!"
"I do most of my own baking, but I decided to order these out of curiosity. They all ended up in the trash. They are bitter and gritty. I understand that this is a problem with a lot of gluten free baked goods, but I have found ways around it. These were bad."
"It's hard to find carrot juice  in stores so I gave it a try and ordered some juice from this seller via amazon....even so I felt kind of poshy doing so.<br />Well, I will do it again. My six bottles of juice were shipped super fast, packaging was very good. The juice itself is excellent. It is actually that rich in taste that I mix it half with water or apple juice. That way the already reasonable price  becomes even better.<br />I am really glad I gave it a try. Drinking a glas of carrot juice a day works wonders on my skin."
"We had Fabulosa on chicken while visiting in Texas, and we were hooked.  We can't find this stuff locally, and are happy to be able to purchase on Amazon.  The sodium is high, but that's really to be expected for a fajita marinade.  It is smoky and delicious on meats and veggies.  Great for grilled meats, too.  It truly IS fabulous."
"Drank an instant green tea from a major producer for several years. Then they changed production and began using sucralose which I don't tolerate well.<br />Tried several different teas before I found Stash's instant green tea. I like it best with a little fresh lemon lime juice. I can drink all I want--don't even need sweetener. Plus as I understand it, it's just made from dried, pulverized green tea leaves--no chemical process. Also it's very coolby I get a discount forn having it delivered by monthly subscription. Phil K."
"I got this food for my dog that is allergic to corn, wheat, potatoes, flax, fish, and pork.  I had the hardest time finding a food that he wasn't allergic to.  I'm so glad I found this food.  He is finally eating and starting to put on some weight.  It is a little pricey but I think it is worth it for such a good product."
"I'ma fairly healthy eater, but I LOVE chips.  Potato chips, tortilla chips, I like them all.  Popchips offer a chip like substance,with the promise of low fat.<br /><br />They crunch like chips but don't quite have a chip like texture; it's closer to a rice cake.  The seasoning is decent as well.  They have a surprising amount of a great sweet potato flavor.<br /><br />The ingredients are okay as far as healthiness.  I like that rice flour is the first ingredient rather than potatoes or corn.  You still get oil, although less than normal chips.  There's more salt and sugar than I would like.<br /><br />In the end I found myself munching through the case of 24 fairly quickly.  Popchips taste good and aren't as bad for you.  Check them out!"
I was giving my shihtzu the Fromm Adult Gold dog food. She didn't seem to want to eat it though so I thought I would try something different. I found the Harmony Farms and thought I'd give it a try. She actually liked it. It's cheaper then the other food and it seemed to contain really healthy ingredients. I couldn't believe how she gobbled this up. BUT after having her on this for a week she developed a rash on her stomach. Took her off and the rash went away completely in 2 days. Her hair also wasn't as soft. This kibble did not do well for her.
"Light and refreshing.  But if you are looking for an alternative to soda,  sorry, but this is pretty much soda. I appreciate the fact that it is 100% natural, and has a full complement of Vitamin C. And I actually like the fact that it isn't too sweet, nor too tart. No added sugar, but plenty of ""fruit sugars"". In the end, though . . it's a soda. My 6-year old loved it."
After finding out whats in Beggin Strips these were recommended to me by a client.  I am a dog groomer.  My Standard Poodle had two this morning and has been vomiting along with diarrhea all day..  enough said..
"I'd been hearing about the product for a couple of years and finally ordered some, but inadvertantly ordered lite! Yuk! After much anticipation, waiting for it's arrival, and then finally opening up the (cheap plastic) jar and putting some on a piece of bread to try it with.... it tasted like wall spackle. Ok, I've never eaten wall spackle, but I'm pretty sure it tastes like ""lite"" baconnaise. Then I realized after careful examination of the label that I ordered the ""lite."" Dammit.<br /><br />Determined to finally taste the ORIGINAL baconnaise, I went back on amazon and (very carefully) ordered the ORIGINAL baconnaise. And it's pretty dang good! I'll leave a review of the original, non-lite product there."
"My dogs eat this product every day, and I rather other the pack of three because I have 4 dogs.  Thanks again Amazon."
"I really wanted my little shihtzu, Sheldon, to like this food but it was a no go here.  He barely sniffed it and walked away.  I loved the size of the cans as well as the impressive ingredient list.  I do have to say that it didn't smell alot like chicken to me though so I understand him not even tasting it.  Too bad though.  I would have loved to add this to the very small list of foods he will eat."
"My Westie - like the picture on the package - loves these treats!  They are the perfect size for a treat or reward and even look cute...we call them<br />""puppy paws"" treats!  Good texture - no mess!  Smell not attractive to humans - but good to a dog!"
"Better than coffee or ANY energy drink !!! This is the authentic, natural item.  Stay away from any other product besides Guarana and Yerbe Mate'- read up on it !! good luck !!"
"Having tried all the varieties of hot chocolate k-cups, Grove Square's are by far the best.  They are very chocolaty, rich, creamy, and leave very little sludge in the bottom of your cup.  Yum..."
"They claim this product is ""unadulterated"", which would make you think ""oh! sweet! it's going to be the BEST, because nobody else's coconut oil says it's ""unadulterated"".  I checked out their website, and for those of you who don't know... you want to go for COLD PRESSED oils. If they're not cold pressed, it means they've been processed with major machinery and subjected to high heats, which as anything goes, can and usually does, kill any good minerals and vitamins. Their site posts information on their extraction process. As of today, this is what it states:<br /><br />""""Manila Coco oil extraction method is through a proprietary, state-of-the-art mechanical expeller (Manila VirginFlo), thermo-stable to hold off the lowest moisture possible (0.1%) to avoid rancidity and keep shelf life consistent up to 3 years under normal conditions. Our oils are 1st and 2nd stage press-induced, without chemical solvents, no bleaching, no deodorizing, no hydrogenation, no fermentation enzymes - to keep its natural light sweet coconut aroma and taste. This method sustains its unique character even when subjected to high (up to 170 degrees Celsius) heat temperatures.""""<br /><br />Mechanical Expeller is their form of extraction. And they also say it sustains unique character... blah blah blah... when subjected to high heat temperatures. Therefore, in my personal opinion, it is not as ""unadulterated"" as their information on their products on Amazon make them sound. I will be steering clear of their products.<br /><br />I'm sorry if my review offends some, but if you're going to pay good money for something, you should know about it. I would use different brands before sticking yourself with this one. I was looking for larger quantities, which is why I looked at this product, however I will be sticking with Nutiva. As their coconut oil is cold pressed soon after the coconuts are cut open. The information below is direct from their website.<br /><br />""""What makes Nutiva's virgin coconut oil so special? Much of the magic lies in the way the oil is processed. Within several hours of the coconuts being chopped, the meat is cold-pressed, unlike other varieties of coconut oil which can be left for more than 10 hours before pressing. Nutiva's approach preserves as much of the oil's natural color, flavor and aroma, giving you the best results for any use.""""<br /><br />If you don't care about how it's processed, it is still going to be much healthier than your average grocery store found vegetable and canola oils. If you want to read some scary things, look up the dark information on how those are processed. YUCK! Talk about horrifying.<br /><br />Thank you for your time.<br />-Amy<br /><br />PS. I used to be one of those ""organic? what kind of fruitcake are you? Think you're more special than anybody else?"" people. But I have learned so much in the past year and a half, dealing with my son's allergies and intollerances. There's more to it than ""oh it's more expensive, so it's just making me feel special because I can afford it."" No. There's WAY more to it than that. I urge everybody to talk to people about organic foods. It's a way of life, a healthier way of life. We all deserve to live healthier. If you live healthier, even though it costs more, in the long term you're saving money because you are healthier. So that means less doctor visits, less expensive (and nasty harmful) medications, etc."
"There are very few things that are even remotely as versatile as Cavender's.  Fantastic on chicken, beef and pork.  I have never tried it on fish, but I'm sure it would be great there too...  I try to keep at least two or three cans on hand at all times so I never run out, and when I'm feeling generous I even give them away to friends."
I love these chips they are the best chips at a low price to pay because they are baked.Only 3 points for weight watchers member's for 1ounce which is about 20 chips and there are 3ounces in this bag.
I like the robust flavor of Emerils coffee and it has enough flavor to give a good cup of coffee in the 10 oz size of my keurig machine
They were stale and hard.  Had to suck on them to get them soft enough to chew them.  Won't buy again.
I may not be an avid tea drinker but I could not stomach the taste of this. I am used to regular green tea or english breakfast. The taste of this brand was terrible
"If you are looking for a sugar high, then these are what you are looking for. Too sweet for me and my family, I don't think we will be ordering these again."
"Overall, this is a nice, light, refreshing drink. The sweetness is a bit sweeter than Juice Squeeze, but not as sweet as Hansen's soda. I tried two flavors: this orange tangerine, and the strawberry watermelon. I preferred this orange one. The flavor was ""cleaner."" But, there are so many different juices in both those drinks, it kindof gets ""muddied."" I think I prefer Juice Squeeze because the flavor seems true-er. My 10-year-old daughter prefers Hansen's, because it is a bit sweeter. But, like I said, overall, this is a very nice drink. No corn syrup. Yea!"
I had received a sample of the mandarin spice and it was so good. I ordered this and definately not the same. Tasteless. I will go back to the tea bags.
"My labrador LOVES all the treats from Dogswell ! However, all of the Dogswell Jerky treats I have come across are Made In China. As a dog lover, I cannot knowingly give my dog a product from China. It does say ""cage-free"", but really? I'm not sure. BUT DOGSWELL Jerky Bars are Made in the USA & my dog loves this just as much! So bad news on the regular jerky, but upside: Dogswell has some USA products too!"
"These are good, but a bit skimpy on the candy coating. The ones I get at my supermarket have a thicker layer of ""yogurt"" coating, but the store doesn't carry them that often. So I keep these on hand just in case the urge strikes and my local store is out.  I love the combination of crispy/salty pretzel with creamy yogurt-flavored candy coating."
"These chips are absolutely incredible!!!  They are so good and so flavorful!!  My favorite is the barbecue flavor!  The best part, they are ALL NATURAL!! Definitely will purchase these again!!!"
This is the best Gluten Free Bread mix we have tried.  The only improvement would be a version with seeds and more texture to simulate the multi grain breads we miss.
This gluten free& milk free product is awesome! I am able to use almond milk in it instead of regular milk. It is great to have such a delicious & easy breakfast that doesn't make my stomach hurt!
"This brand of coffee has been available in my local stores for some time -- I've believe the company is local.  I've been drinking it for quite some time and have not tired of it.  I'm particularly fond of the Turtle Sundae but all the flavors are good.  I can't say that I've had a bad one.<br /><br />As it turns out, it's less expensive to order it from Amazon and have it show up at my front door than it is for me to run out to the local Walmart to get it.  It's a no brainer.  Try it, if you like rich, flavored coffee, you'll like it."
"As an ex New Yorker, I've had fond memories of fresh baked 7 layer cake from a local Brooklyn bakery. Unfortunately this product is a very poor representation of the product. The cake was too dry and the filling had very little taste. The chocolate topping was both too sweet and too soft.  I purchased 2 cakes and they were sent US Mail. One cake had its topping melt in the Texas heat while sitting in our mailbox and was thrown away. I'm still searching for a great cake."
"It's no secret that high fructose corn syrup is detrimental to your health. Unfortunately, it's also no secret that it has replaced other forms of sugar in a disturbingly large number of manufactured foods. Even worse is that most high fructose corn syrup is made from genetically modified corn.<br /><br />Since the late 1980s, HFCS has replaced regular table sugar, honey, and similar sweeteners in practically everything. Prolonged consumption of HFCS is now the topic of much debate and we are learning that it can cause long-term damage to the body.<br />High Fructose Corn Syrup Dangers<br /><br />1. Significant Risk of Weight Gain & Obesity<br />2. Increased Risk of Developing Type-2 Diabetes<br />3. Hypertension and Elevated ""Bad"" Cholesterol Levels<br />4.  Long-Term Liver Damage<br />5. Mercury Exposure from HFCS<br /><br />Kelloggs and other manufacturers know this and are slowly getting rid of this sweetner. Look at the cover of Post Rain Bran. They are advertising that it contains NO HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP.I applaud them for this. High Fructose Corn Syrup is made from genetically modified corn from Monsanto which uses systemic pesticides in their seeds which is causing Colony collapse disorder in bees. I am a bee keeper and have been avoiding all products with HFCS in them to save my family and the bees. Watch vanishing of the Bees,Food Matters and Food Inc. They are all sold on Amazon. Excellent movies which will change your health dramatically and the way you think and eat."
Haviland Thin Mints are the best on the market. Much better than York mint patties. Could not find them at a regular retal store. Found them at Amazon.com
"Emeril's Big Easy is a stong, dramatic coffee with a lot of kick.  It will wake you up and keep you going all day long.  I love everything about this coffee.  If you like your coffee to be like colored water, don't order this one..it is only for real coffee lovers."
"My baby likes the mac n cheese in the jars. So, when I couldn't find the jars at the store I was at, I tried these mac n cheeses thinking they were the same. They are not. She doesn't like these. Maybe it is a texture issue mainly as these are much runnier than the jar kind. Looking for more mac n cheese jars."
"I've looked everywhere for a decaf espresso for my DeLonghi EC355. Tried coffee from the grocery store but the decaf was never espresso grind, ordered Newman's decaf espresso grind on-line and it wasn't that great. Not good flavor for espresso, and just OK for cappuccino. I tried this on a whim because of the price and the super saver shipping here on Amazon and I was floored with my frist cup! It's rich, it has flavor, the crema is excellent! I have signed up for the auto shipment of this and couldn't be happier. I can finally have excellent Italian coffee and I don't even have to leave home OR go to Italy to find it."
"My husband likes these a lot. They are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy. They are more browner than I would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture. Not bad, though. Just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health. They do have about 1/2 the calories in fat, however."
"I am always on the lookout for healthy but tasty foods that are low in calories. These crackers are good, not in a ""omg"" type of good, but they have an interesting yet addictive taste that I can't really explain. I would definately recommend them. Everyone I give them to keeps asking me for more. I guess I should stop sharing."
"Baxters soups are usually very nice, but the lobster bisque is especially good. It tastes authentic, it has a good flavour, is creamy, and has just enough lobster bits to make it interesting. Add some fresh black pepper and a dash of brandy or sherry and it rivals soup served in a very good restaurant.<br /><br />It's also surprisingly low calorie. Though the nutrition info here says 130 calories for 8oz, the label actually says 120 calories, so even if you ate the whole can for lunch you would consume only about 220 calories."
"Really?  Who blends this stuff and decides that it is good?  Ugh.  I can sum this nastyness up in one quick phrase.  Stale airline coffee!  If you like that flavor, then you will love this one, if you don't like thin cardboard soaked, never washed the pot out, and the water came from a tin canteen, flavored coffee, then you won't like this one either!  I would give this zero stars if I could.  WOW, likely the worst cup of coffee that I have ever had.  I hope Wolfy reads this as his name is on the package and I expected more, now I know not to buy any of his signature products, awesome, thanks for saving me $$ next time!  The package says Extra Bold, but it doesn't taste extra bold.  It's almost like they put some ground instant powder in the mix to make it stronger."
this is a great product. Perfect for the celiac searching for biscuit mix or pancake mix that actually tastes good.  Also great topping for chicken pot pie.
"This has a very dark chocolate flavor that mixes quickly and smoothly in hot water. No chucks like most of the other brands. Milk chocolate is fine for those who enjoy that but for real chocolate lovers that enjoy the true flavor of dark chocolate, don't miss this."
"I really like this blend.  I've had a hard time with Keurig flavors, but this one seems to fit the bill.<br />The taste is strong, nutty...but not bitter.  I like a good strong cup.  I find many of the Green Mountain varieties, especially the mild blends, lacking in the bite I enjoy.  This one is not like that.  I would recommend for those who like Starbucks."
Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food.  They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great.  They are fit and not over weight.  This vendor ships extremely fast.  Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book!
"Buying this product seems to be almost literally like rolling the dice in a game of craps!<br /><br />My experience with this seems to be similar to the experience of ""Peter R."", unfortunately.<br /><br />The price was excellent.  I ordered mine after the date of "" J. Robert Bois'"" positive experience / review was written but before the date of ""Cindy 2366's"" positive experience / written review.  I bought these & gave them to my Dad, as he *LOVES* dates.  I noticed when I was visiting him, the dried fruit basket was hanging around in his 'fridge a lot longer than any other date basket I had ever ordered for him.<br /><br />Finally I asked him about them.  He said that he did not want to be rude to me or hurt my feelings but....  the dates, well, he was wondering if he should try & eat the seeds in the center & see if they were soft, because the dates themselves were hard as a rock & tasted stale.  I was mortified to say the least...  Then he wanted to know (jokingly) if he had done something to make me mad & I bought these for him as his punishment.  (No, but I had to laugh when he asked about that.)<br />Me personally, I have not tried them.  I will take his word for it!  :)<br /><br />I told him to throw it away or put it out for the squirrels.  After a week of offering the dates,  I picked them up out of his backyard and threw them away.  The squirrels, opossums, & raccoons declined to dine on the dates.<br /><br />It seems to be hit or miss with the ""Broadway Basketeers Irish St. Patrick's Dried Fruit Gift Basket"" purchase.<br /><br />I will not say flat out ""NO!  Do Not Purchase This Item, It is Not Good!""  That is a choice you will have to make on your own.  I just wanted to pass along my experience with the gift basket.<br /><br />Thank Goodness I caught it when it was on special & did not have the full current purchase price invested in the box!  I would have been really sad then!<br /><br />Amazon, as usual, did a fabulous job with the shipping, packaging, and they arrived quickly, in the time frame advertised / promised.<br /><br />Best of luck & I hope others have better experiences than my Dad / I had!<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004134H9W"">Broadway Basketeers Irish St. Patrick's Dried Fruit Gift Basket</a>"
I keep this on hand for the young at heart.  We enjoy a cup almost every night.  Good taste.  will buy again.
"I have never been a believer in any herbal teas until a coworker gave me a mug of BREATHE DEEP tea with honey last winter when I was coughing a lot.  Even one sip brought relief to my throat and by the time I had finished the mug, the coughing was over and done with.  I immediately went on a search for the product and finally found it in the gourmet section of a local grocery.  Then, I found it on Amazon... and a LOT less expensive!  BREATHE DEEP tea has not only helped me with my respiratory issues (asthma, bronchitis, chronic sinus congestion, etc.), I've shared it with family members and friends who are also amazed at what one cup of BREATHE DEEP tea can do.  I'm getting ready to order my supply for the upcoming winter.  I do NOT want to be caught without this in the cupboard."
"For someone with a gluten problem this is the best spaghetti on the market, without a doubt."
"Really tasty. Fast, easy and convenient. Mixes great with yogurt, water, oatmeal, lots of stuff. That's great for me because I really love the orange flavor."
"I will start by being kind, It is a good idea to save money with an item or concept like this. It makes good sense to use your own coffee beans and avoid the cost of the pre-filled commercial K-cups you buy at the store.<br /><br />Now, I received my DisposaKups over a month after ordering them and put them to use.  I was immediately disappointed, filters did not hold very much coffee, It was a struggle to get the lids to fit together with the filter and outer plastic cup.  The coffee was very weak.<br /><br />This product actually creates more waste in a landfill than the commercially made K-cups. The body and lids are plastic.  Normal K-cups do not have a plastic lid.  Notice they say 100% disposable....So put them in the trash. They are not recyclable = landfill.<br /><br />They are not convenient, they are a bit messy, a pain to put together and still expensive.  Not worth it! There are better alternatives out there that will save you money, make better coffee and not go into a landfill.<br /><br />Sorry, I wish I had better news, I think I will return these."
"I'd had this product shipped to me before from a relative living in Italy.  They really have coffee in them, so you have to be careful not to bite them in half.  There is a dark chocolate outer shell with some sort of praline lining the inside and finally coffee in the middle.  If you are a coffee lover, then you must try it.  I share my shipment with a few people at work that have also fallen in love with them.  The company that makes these knows how to make quality chocolates.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y8Y8HY"">Pocket Coffee Ferrero 6-18 Piece Packs (108 Piece Case)</a>"
"Great food! I love the idea of one food for all ages & breeds. Ît's a real convenience as well as a really good product.  My 3 dogs eat less, have almost no gas, their poop is regular and a perfect consistency, what else can a mom ask for!!"
I agree with the review about the strange taste.  I LOVE LOVE Black Jewell NATURAL flavor popcorn so I decided to try the Butter one. It popped up fine but it just has a weird taste!  Even my popcorn loving 12yr old said something was wrong with the flavor.  I ordered 6 boxes...don't know what I am going to do with the 5 boxes left...maybe donate? :-( I will continue to buy the Natural by the case and butter it myself.
"These gave me a headache, too much sugar, and other ingredients that didn't sit well.  I would not recommend to someone trying to eat healthier."
"not having a lot of choices in puppy food at the local store, i was glad they had Cesar.  Toy Fox Terrier puppies have a very sensitive digestive system and mouth/teeth.  this is good quality and texture.  also at a small 3.5 oz. container, it's the perfect amount.  no leftover or waste.  this is perfect for small breeds and they love it.  mixes well with dry food too."
"I happen to be a person with acid reflux that drinks large amounts of coffee.  In fact, the coffee may be the cause of my acid reflux!  While I have not used Puroast long enough to see if it cures me, what I can say is that it TASTES GREAT!  I am going to order some more of this just for the flavor, and will see if over time my acid reflux is reduced as well.  So, if you have acid reflux, give this coffee a shot - you'll enjoy it for the taste at least!!"
"It was nice to find an organic instant oatmeal with way less added sugar than the others on the market, with about 6g of total sugars compared to the others at about 13g. Those other ""healthy"" organic oatmeals tasted like candy to me.<br /><br />As expected, McDougall's tastes noticeably less sweet. Instead, you taste the oats and the apples. I'm very pleased with this product."
"Clean taste and clean energy.<br /><br />Packaging is attractive, simple, and elegant as well.<br /><br />Sustainable sourcing and organic cert round out the whole package.<br /><br />Overall nice product."
"At first, I thought these tasted a little artificial. After a few handfuls I realized I like them, regardless.<br /><br />I am a big fan of this company's products, and have even gone so far as to speak with one of their growers about the integrated pest management systems they employ (using the smallest amount of pesticides possible).  I will keep buying all their other flavors. The Bold line, especially the Habanero, is also excellent, as are the dark chocolate variety."
My husband loves this rich bold coffee.  He drinks it every morning without fail!
"I've bought many Annie's products, including another type of mac & cheese, so I was expecting to like this item as well.  I eat whole grain pasta all the time and love it.  With this product, I think it was more the cheese sauce than the pasta that turned me off.  I found it watery and didn't think there was enough of it, although I'm not sure if having more of something I didn't really like would be an improvement.<br /><br />I'll stick to other kinds of mac & cheese and skip this in the future."
"Sojo's diet lacks calcium, and if fed as directed will cause severe metabolic bone disease in your dog.  This diet requires supplementation with a balanced calcium/phosphorous additive to be safe."
"The older I get I more particular I am. And, as snack treats go, this is a winner! It's pure taste bud delight to savor the mixed flavors of healthy fruit and dark chocolate. Addictive indeed, but minus the usual post snack guilt! Sincere appreciation to the creators of this fine treat."
"Sorry, but I could not drink that. Some people call it old world coffee. I call it old cheap hotel coffee. It is soooo dark in color, just like ashes. The smell is not pleasant at all. And it tastes just like a bad coffee made with terrible tap water you can find inside of a cheap hotel. Sorry, I rather drink no coffee than drink this! One star for me."
"Honestly the first time I tried Jamaica me crazy I had to double check to make sure that I didn't leave the pod irom my last cup n the coffee maker. Weak coffee, flavor didn't appeal to me either. Might appeal to someone who likes their coffee on the weaker side. Wolfgang's vienna roast was pleasant though."
"Five minutes in, one tentacle was bitten off, ball inside cracked in half. Not durable enough to be a dog toy. Disappointed :(. So is the dog :(."
I am very happy with the DisposaCup Single Serve Brewers. The item arrived in a timely manner and was in perfect packaging. Now I can brew my favorite brand of coffee anytime I want.
This tea is the most awful stuff I've ever put in my mouth.  It has a chemical taste.  I tried adding sugar and it didn't help. I enjoy the Arizona Pomegranate Gree Tea and would highly recomment it.
"It seems the flavor selection on Amazon has been limited these days to some variation of hazelnut, french vanilla or chocolate so when I saw this one, I thought I'd give it a try.  Never having had Wolfgang Puck's k-cups, I was hoping they'd be as good as the Wolfgang Puck coffee I've had in hotel coffeemakers that were a part of my room but alas, I was mistaken. I wouldn't say it's the worst I've had but the flavor is pretty weak and the coffee itself is too.  I feel like I'm drinking coffee that's been made with grounds that have already been perked.  In other words - the flavor seems to be already squeezed out of them and I'm getting leftovers.<br /><br />If you're looking for a weakly flavored coffee that doesn't really taste like much of anything, this is your pod.  If you're looking for better, richer flavors, stick with Green Mountain which sadly Amazon doesn't seem to carry anymore except through third party vendors who want to charge $60 for a box!"
"Great flavor, easy to dispense, and a nice metal canister!  I'm not a big connoisseur of teas, but the fact that it was green tea helped me decide to try it.  And, for the nice price, I'm glad I did.  Will be nice to give a canister away here and there to friends and family."
"There is contradicting information.  The description says Senior Greenie Large, while the photo shows ""regular"" as well as 27 treats versus 27 ounce.  Anyone that reviews and can clarify the actual product would be much appreciated."
So far I have had the habanero and the medium sauces and they were amazing. My fiance and I use them nearly daily and I just picked up 3 more. It goes really well on all sorts of dishes to add the extra kick.<br /><br />The sauce itself lasts a lot longer than it appears. It is thick and a bottle will last us a couple of weeks of heavy use. We love to use it for breakfast on eggs or in burritos and for dinners or soups for added spice.
"Arrived on time.  The flavor comes through, which is important when using a K-cup.  It is bold, and sometimes slighly acidic.  It doesn't taste as smooth as the Newman's Bold."
These are delicious. I didn't like all of the flavors but next time I will just buy the box in the original flavor.
"Jack links are my family's favorite! They are great for snacking, lunchbox or anytime. i only wish they had come individually wrap to stay fresher longer. a container of some sort would have been ideal. they still taste great. i'd buy them again and again. worth the price and no hassles--well maybe the constant e-mails to buy more and other products is a bit annoying!"
"... get this type of sugar any other way than through ordering it because the shipping is INSANE!  The sugar is fine but for the price of the shipping, it was not worth it."
"I was in a local grocery store that has a lot of items imported from England when I saw cans of Heinz Spotted Dick Pudding. Well, I'd heard of it. Hasn't everyone? The name sounds more like a medical condition than a type of foodstuff and it must lend itself to a certain middle-school-level humor, not necessarily limited to those of that particular age. In any case, I had about a half can (too much) after lunch. I heated it up in the microwave and, after heating, coated it with a veneer of Devon custard. The combination was quite good. It's much too high in calories (from fats and sugars), of course, so I'll have to watch my consumption. However, it was an interesting treat and now when I hear the snickers, I'll understand a bit better.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"
"We had trouble finding this locally - delivery was fast, no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores."
"I can honestly say that this is THE BEST oatmeal I have ever eaten.  I am having a hard time locating it in NC.  Costco used to carry it but doesn't carry it any longer.  The shipping charges on the company's website are too high, hopefully I'll find it somewhere in my travels.  I HIGHLY recommend it."
I made purchased this coffee a number of times.....this is an excellent value for a coffee with an excellent taste......will certainly purchase again
I usually do not feel mislead by reviews but this is one of the few.  This is very mediocre cocoa powder but nothing mediocre about the premium price.  Not the worst thing I have had but will never get it again.
I purchased these based on others recommendations. The rice cakes are delicious. Thinner than the usual rice cakes in the supermarkets. Dense...not full of air. I covered them with PB2 (those watching their weight can eat peanut butter for 45 calories a serving vs 190 for regular PB and it tastes exactly the same). I too highly recommend these rice cakes.
"Why in the world would Amazon want to sell an item and say can be ingested,  when it clearly has ingredients that can cause cancer. Wish every state would wake up like California and ban all these cancer causing things."
"I only ever had pumpkin seeds before in cereal, in small amounts.  These are great; just add them to Bob's granola, or yogurt; even just plain by the handful, they are great."
"My wife and I came across this tea in Hawaii and its the best!  We can't find it in stores in our area, so we're glad Amazon.com stocks it -- only place I know of to get it.  Each box of 20 comes cellophane wrapped, so you could give some idividual 20 bag packs as small gifts/thank-yous."
"I do actually get heartburn from coffee, so I was excited to try this ""low acid"" french roast coffee.<br /><br />I have noticed that it does seem less acidic, I am on my third cup with no heartburn so far... though I would not chose to drink this as my standard coffee.  I normally brew dunkin donuts brand coffees at home and really enjoy their flavor.  There are a few other brands that I will buy when they are available in this town, though that is rarely.<br /><br />I did not care for the flavor of this coffee.  It was very wooden tasting and almost had an old burnt coffee flavor to it.  I guess if you HAD to drink coffee and were really worried about the acid then this would work... but I'd rather stick with good tasting coffee and follow it up with a tums.  I would not purchase this product on my own."
"When I saw the mint iced tea powder on the website, I thought I would like it. But when  I received it and tried one, I was very disappointed. It was the green tea and not sweet at all. The flavor was nothing at all like an iced tea like I was expecting. I had to add sugar to it to get a flavor that I like to be similar to regular iced tea. I don't even know if I'll be using the others I had received. Sorry about this, but you did ask for my review on this."
"I tried the Frooties mBerry and the effect lasted one hour for me. I purchased this version since it had excellent reviews and was a slightly higher price.<br /><br />This version lasted only ten minutes. I tried tablets out of three different packages from three different batches to make sure it was not a faulty batch. The results from each test was the same.<br /><br />I would not suggest this version of the product, other tablet versions may be more effective but would suggest actual berries."
These crackers are just like I remember crackers tasting like before I went gluten free.  They are a crunchy mix between a buttery Ritz and saltine.  Delicious!
"I ordered this product after enjoying a previous Vine acquisition--<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00094JEUO"">Izze Sparkling Clementine Soda Full Case (24 12oz Bottles)</a>--fully expecting to like it.  It appears that the use of 100% juice in this product makes a big difference from the Izze's use of 70% juice/30% sparkling water.  I like Izze, but do not like Switch much.<br /><br />Switch tastes -- and is -- just like orange juice, except it is carbonated.  I do not think orange juice was meant to be carbonated.  It just doesn't add anything to the taste or consistency that I found enjoyable.  It also left a lengthy aftertaste of juice burps which I did not enjoy.  So it is not that the makes have done anything wrong or poor quality, it is just that this reviewer did not like how the concept worked out."
"I had previously purchased the chicken and the duck from this line so I wanted to try the beef liver.<br />Well, my dog likes the flavor but I don't like how dry they are. They have very sharp edges and I had to be creative to soften them a bit so that my dog wouldn't suffer from a rapture in the esophagus while eating them as they are. The other 2 (chicken + duck) are a little chewer than this one. I would not buy this again unless texture improves."
"These chips are a regular in my house now.  In fact they are the only chips I buy.  The BBQ flavor is my favorite.  I buy these in single serving packs because if I buy a bigger bag, it is too hard to stop eating them."
"When I bought these mushrooms before, they were clearly labled ""from Italy"". This time, the origin is not mentioned on the bag, and when I checked their website, I see they've written a bunch of malarky about how porcinis'taste the same wherever they're from, even from North America or China. That is just not true. Porcini from Europe taste better: the terroir changes the mushroom's flavor considerably, just as it changes the flavor of grapes made into wine. Since JR Mushrooms refuses to reveal their country of origin, I must assume they are selling cheaper, possibly contaminated mushrooms from China in order to make a bigger profit. Beware! Buy another brand."
"My dogs have been eating Canidae for years.  They have always done well on the food.  Currently, I have three dogs and they have had no issues with the new formulations.  I have to say that my black lab mix has an even brighter coat than before.  I love that they came out with a 44# bag.  With three dogs I go through a lot of dog food.  I definitely recommend this food."
I can get this at my local grocery store for $2.69 per can ($32.28 for 12).
"I love SnackMasters' turkey jerky, so I naturally decided to try natural turkey jerky.  This turkey jerky is the same (or better) quality as the regular variety, but too dry.  I would recomend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EZMRRA"">SnackMasters Turkey Jerky, Teriyaki</a>, instead"
"I really liked these.  Great snack for someone watching their fat and or calorie intake.  Light, crunchy and full of flavor.  They don't taste like a traditional chip they seem infused with air or something.  The biggest problem for me would be if I bought the large bag I would be too tempted to eat way more than a serving.  So these single sized bags are ideal.<br /><br />Also should mention that the sweet potato variety that I tried do not contain any dairy which is a necessity for me and I'm sure others have similar issues."
"Have been using this product for about a year now. My dog loves these chicken jerky treats. It's a great to be able to treat her with something she likes, as well as adding these needed supplements to her diet."
At Sam's stores you can buy the 175 count for $12.98.  My restaurant customers LOVE these with their guest checks! Guess I am taking a trip to Sam's. Sorry Amazon.  I will remain loyal and use you for all your other great deals though.
"I recieved my stevia a couple of weeks ago and it is excellent. My only problem is that the four containers were little more than half-way filled, but the total amount of stevia is sufficient and I've been using it everyday and I have not used much.<br />Overall, for the price, it is excellent."
"Amazon's suggestion for a 4 star review is ""I like it.""  That being said, I gave a 5 star review to the Spicy Thai chips.  These chips are perfect for people that enjoy a spicy chip, but whose taste buds don't appreciate the added sweetness and ginger flavor.  The only thing I REALLY dislike about these chips (along with the rest of the flavors) is that the serving size is HALF the bag.  Really?  Who can eat half and save the rest for later???  Not me..."
"I'm a sucker for caramel anything.........love the flavor, the aroma, and most important the taste.  I honestly do not like flavored coffees in the morning, but I have made an exception for this one!"
"They kind of have an acquired consistency that you need to get used to. The texture reminds me sort of like cooked mushrooms. They have a slightly rubbery snap to them. The first time I tried them I hated them. I started the Atkins diet and now that I never eat chips or pasta I have learned to get used to them, then I started really liking them. The first time I boiled them way too long and the recipe I made with them wasn't good. Just mix in RAGU and pour cheese on top and you have guilt free spaghetti. I even took Alfredo sauce which usually has like 3 carbs per serving? mixed that in there, fast, simple, and NO CARBS it's crazy. The fact that they are so guilt free made me have an acquired taste for them. Being that they are tofu, they would totally taste amazing fried up in stir fry, the texture would work well for that most definitely. So give them a couple tries, or check out some good recipies online and take your time with them, they are worth it."
it has big thread and without smell.<br />i don't believe this is a real saffron. STOP buying this fake saffron.
This is a great decaf coffee. It's not bland and has a very good taste. It's labeled Extra Bold but is not too strong tasting or bitter. It's the only decaf that I have found so far for the Keurig that I enjoy.
This stuff tasted like pipe tobacco smells. My Son didn't like it either and I ended up throwing it out.
This seasoning adds just the right amount of spice to almost any dish! If you want something with a little kick you will love this seasoning! Can't beat the price for a top notch product!
After wasting many batches of these nuggets I finally got them to puff up properly and was excited to try some that were not still rock hard.<br />What I found was that the texture is not very appealing and they smell horrific. I know most pork rinds smell funny but these were extremely pungent and the after taste was even worse.<br /><br />I ended up just throwing away the whole bag because I was not interested in ever having that taste in my mouth again.<br /><br />Great idea. Was excited to try..  but these just fell way short.
I bought this product because I had a coupon it was a little expensive but I give one a week to my dog.  My dog loves them and if she could speak she would say please give me one a day.
"I've got to believe these other reviewers haven't actually looked at the list of ingredients that make up these chips. Here they are:<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: SUGAR, PARTIALLY HYDROGENATED PALM KERNEL OIL, COCONUT OIL, LACTOSE, WHEY, NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS (INCLUDING BARLEY PROTEIN), NON-FAT MILK, BUTTERMILK SOLIDS, SODIUM CASEINATE, SOY LECITHIN-AN EMULSIFIER, SALT, ARTIFICIAL COLORS (YELLOW 5 LAKE, YELLOW 6 LAKE, BLUE 2 LAKE)<br /><br />Now I must admit that I didn't look at the label either.  I've been using Nestle's chocolate chips for years, and I thought it was a name I could trust.  Apparently not.<br /><br />So let me tell you how I discovered what the ingredients were.  I was making brownies for the kids for a semi-special occasion so I bought the premium white morsels --thinking they were white chocolate-- and these butterscotch ones.  I dumped them in my batter and noticed when I took the brownies out that the chips didn't seem to have melted.  I didn't think anything of it until I sampled some of the white morsels for a snack.  Very waxy on the tongue.  Not nice like good chocolate would be.  So I tried the butterscotch ones.  Where the heck was the flavor?<br /><br />Well I was shocked when I read the label.  I had no idea that the white chocolate had been reformulated to be Chocolate Free, and I assume that in the past these chips actually had some sort of natural butterscotch element to them, instead of being made of barley protein and artificial flavorings.<br /><br />I mean look at the ingredients; there's more artificial flavors by volume than butter and milk.  And there's a whopping 8 grams of sugar in 1 teaspoon of these things.  Which would be acceptable for cooking sweets if it wasn't for the 4 grams of Trans-Fats laden goo that was also in them.<br /><br />In any case, I've thrown out the rest of these two bags.  If the health concerns weren't bad enough, they don't taste good.  Really sweet more than flavorful, and waxy on the tongue when you eat them au naturel.<br /><br />Pam T~<br />mom/blogger/brownie baker"
great customer service... I had this product the next day !! Amazon and this supplier are a great combination. I will buy from this supplier again.
"I first found this product in an Asian grocery store close to home.  They went out of business and I went back to making ginger tea with fresh ginger.  Good, but this is much easier.  I often mix it with regular tea, a little sugar or lemon.  Delicious!"
"My favorite coffees are the big dark roasts like French, Italian, and Full City.  This K-cup dark roast has a big, bold flavor, but lacks balance.  The level of smokiness, bitterness, and acid are way too high, and the result is not enjoyable.  I liked the dark roasts. for the Keurig from Green Mt, Newman, and Donut Shop much more than this one."
"Pocket Coffee is a tiny little chocolate box with a shot of espresso inside.  The whole family loves them, and I give boxes of them as gifts at Christmas to the coffee lovers on my list.  They're a big hit!"
"Don't buy these.  They are made in China.  I found them on a ""made in USA"" page on Amazon but that is incorrect."
"I wanted to like this..maybe its because I can drink regular coffee<br />without the nasty side effects of acid problems, that this did not<br />taste so good to me.  I love dark roast coffees but this one really<br />was not what I had hoped for.  It was odd tasting to me, more bitter<br />than other dark french roasts are.  I usually drink my coffee black,<br />but even the addition of 1/2-n-1/2 didn't help save the rest of the<br />pot from being poured down the sink.  I gave it two stars as I also<br />know that taste is like art...subjective."
"This is the BEST!! I am thrilled someone finally made this. Yes, it is less expensive to make your own, BUT, they have the taste down perfect!! Amazon needs to make this a subscribe and save order!"
"This drawer is fabulous and holds a TON of kcups. It does make the machine too tall for low-hanging cabinets. However, it saves on total counter space needed (versus a carousel) and looks great. It is very sturdy and should last for a long time. I have the Keurig Platinum and have plenty of room to put sugar/Splenda packets or mugs. Love it!"
"These crackers are the best I've tried so far.  If I didn't have celiac's disease, I'd buy a non-gluten-free cracker, but am very pleased with the consistency (softer than others I've tasted) of this gluten free cracker and it doesn't have that ""peppery"" taste that most others have.  They're great in soup or with peanut butter or cheese as a snack."
"This was the first time I'd bought any Torani syrups, so I wanted to have some variety to see what I liked.  I was actually really surprised that I liked so many of the syrup flavors!  My personal favorites are hazelnut and irish cream, but there's only 1 flavor that I don't like.  I love that it's low on calories, made with Splenda, and the tastes are really very good.  Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting to spice up their coffee routine!"
"I absolutely love the crystal lite on the go packets. They are perfect for work, home, etc. I got these online because they were always sold out at my grocery store. I love the peach iced tea as well as the lemonade. Its true, you really dont have to use the whole packet but I like mine tart so I do. Perfect if you are like me and trying to cut calories."
"Tartaric acid and cream of tartar are not the same thing. Cream of tartar is made from tartaric acid. It is a weak salt derived from tartaric acid, when it is half-neutralized with potassium hydroxide.<br /><br />In most home recipes that call for tartaric acid can substitute 2 tsp cream of tartar for 1tsp tartaric acid. But if you are buying tartaric acid, you are not looking for cream of tartar and the seller should not label cream of tartar as tartaric acid."
"This makes much better pizza than the ready made whole wheat pizza crusts that you buy in the stores. First of all, Carbquik takes about 15 minutes to cook, so the vegetables and cheese have enough time to cook and blend together. And knowing that it has 90 percent less carbohydrates doesn't make me feel guilty when I have a pizza craving. I don't feel bloated and sick like I do after I engorge myself on a fast food pizza. Carbquik is the base of a healthy pizza that makes me feel good after eating it. We have reordered many times and always have several boxes in reserve."
"This is now my favorite herb tea--full-bodied and extraordinarily flavorful, it doesn't have the ""weakly flavored hot water"" taste of many herbal teas. I keep trying to find another plum tea that I can get locally but to no avail; they are all just pale by comparison. I'll have to keep ordering it online!"
"My impressions:  The coffee tastes fine but is unspectacular.  French Roast really burns a good deal of flavor out of the coffee bean and sort of homogenizes coffee flavors, so what you get is a dark roasted coffee (some might even say it tastes a little burned) that's deep and mellow.  If you're a fan of Latin American coffee flavors, this will NOT be the roast for you.  If you like Sumatra or are a general fan of French Roasts, you'll find this palatable.<br /><br />I made a point of drinking this coffee on an empty stomach to test the acidity and it did not give me any stomach upset after 2 cups.  You can interpret that any number of ways.  ;-)<br /><br />In the interest of full disclosure, I was sent one serving of this coffee by Amazon to test drive.  Because I was not able to brew more than one pot, I cannot adequeately comment on how this coffee might affect someone who suffers from acid reflux anecdotally.  I assume that the target audience (and only buyers of this product) would fall into that catagory, and sadly, I cannot advise you fairly on how this is going to affect you gastronomically.  Also consider that each case of GERD (Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease) is widely variable based on the individual, therefore this product might be fantastic for some and still too acidic for others.<br /><br />So at this point you may be wondering, should I buy this?  Sure.  Start with as small a quantity as possible, test it for yourself, see how you like the flavor and whether or not the ""low acid"" aspect of this coffee meets your expectations."
"Butter Toffee is not a flavor I thought I would like - for some reason the name makes me think of an icky flavor. However, I became hooked at first bite. This flavor is much sweeter than the Honey Roasted. It certainly becomes my top ""dessert almonds"" when in need of that sweet replacement.<br /><br />Absolutely great for those on a low-carb or Keto diet - only 6 Net Carbs per serving. The bold, sweet flavor keeps you satisfied after only a small amount.<br /><br />Highly recommended!"
I used the Bisquick Pancake and Baking GF mix to make snickerdoodle cookies.  They were very good and stayed fresh for some time.  Thank you for offering this mix.
"Talk about a versatile new product. Drink it hot on a winter morning, drink it iced on a summer afternoon, mix it with your favorite coctail, add it to a marinade, combine it with your your best herbs- I love it all! It's smooth and almost silky texture and lack of tannins make it great for anything. How has it taken so long to make it to the states!"
"I love Sleepy Time tea, I used to give it to my children, since it is caffeine free, as they grew up, it helped them warm up and fall asleep quickly.<br /><br />Just a little story and a small cup of warm tea, that was the routine especially in the winter. They are all grown now but I find that they are now serving it to my grand children and it is having the save effect.<br /><br />I still drink it between all the other teas I enjoy but this one is just a little more special."
"I've never given my dogs real pig ears, so I don't know how tough they are, but I assume they are like rawhide.<br />Instead of gnawing on Better than Ears for a long time, they eat them pretty fast.<br />Not a problem, just not what I expected.<br />Man, do they go crazy over these things. But then again...who can resist bacon flavor?"
"I found it to be watery. At least, more so than other canned pumpkin. It's likely less watery than fresh pumpkin puree, but definitely more watery than Libby's or the generic brand at my grocery store.<br /><br />The texture upon opening this organic one was smooth while the other was irregular. It made my pies taste a bit bland as well, but I also made a mistake with the crust (too much water) so that had a hand in my pie disappearing in two days rather than one.<br /><br />I really liked the art, though. The label. It's nice.<br /><br />Basically, it won't make a fantastic pie, but it'll do. Especially if you would like organic. I suggest straining through coffee filters (placed over a mesh colander) overnight or longer."
"The product is great...but it arrived mostly melted together instead of individual drop pieces.  I am sure it was over heated in the shipping.  We live in central California where temperatures get into the 100s.  I am  able to use them, anyway, by just cutting them up.<br />Partly my fault...I will try to remember to order during the winter months for cooler weather.<br />Excellent product..."
"DEfintely not as tasty as the Madhouse Munchies which are my family's favorite. Kettle's are dark/burnt,more broken bits, taste greasy-oily and not the light crunch. Oh well."
"I can't sleep past 6 AM anymore because of this food.  One of my cats sits on my face, attempting to suffocate me into consciousness (cats aren't very good at biology..), while the other kneads every bare spot of flesh he can find with his claws of ""love"" until I get up.  If I stop in the bathroom between stumbling out of bed and into the kitchen, I'm treated to a rousing refrain of ""MROW MROW SCRATCH YOWL"" outside of the door--and that's if they don't follow me into the bathroom and circle around my legs like they're caught in my gravitational pull, all the while insisting can opening is a far better use of my thumbs than anything else.<br /><br />The only cons, really.  And they're cute cons, so I let it slide.<br /><br />Suffice it to say, my cats love this stuff.  They eat it, rocket around the house for 45 minutes like they've just done some meth (oh, the power of organic ingredients!), then collapse in the sunspot on my vacated bed and sleep until I get home from work.<br /><br />Cat win?  I think so."
"This jar of light coral goo is filed in the back of the fridge with ""one-recipe"" stuff and other exotica.  It is waiting there for me to admit that my curiosity and desire for novelty beat back my better judgement. In a blind-tasting, ""bacon"" would not be my first reaction and the texture is slimy and unappealing (room temp or cold)."
"These gave me a headache, too much sugar, and other ingredients that didn't sit well.  I would not recommend to someone trying to eat healthier."
"I feel better about feeding this product to my dogs.  I was using another popular brand,<br />but it contained a lot of fillers.  One of my dogs is ""pickier,"" so he would prefer a meatier<br />taste, but he does clean it up eventually."
"The delivery was extremely quick, the packaging was fine, and if you suck off all the honey, the almonds even taste pretty good. but i for one do not like this flavor. Mind you, I could eat 3095826 honey roasted PEANUTS."
"The combination of ginger, pepper and sarsaparilla is delicious and distinctive. This tea gives me energy without the negative side effects of caffeine. It's good any time, although I especially enjoy it for an afternoon lift."
"This is by far the best GF bread we've found for our 8 year old who has Celiacs.  Super easy to bake in our West End Hi Rise bread maker - simply follow directions and the loaf comes out perfectly.  It has a very child friendly taste - I disagree with other reviewers that say it is too sweet, it is similar in taste to a ""normal"" honey wheat loaf - and MOST IMPORTANTLY NO HORRIBLE SOUR AFTER TASTE like we have found to be the case in some of the other mixes and store bought loaves we've tried.  The texture is denser than ""normal"" bread similar to other GF breads - almost cake like - BUT it is tasty, moist and NOT CRUMBLY like other GF breads. The slices kept perfectly in a vacuum-sealed Ziploc bag in the fridge for 5 days.  I took two slices out of the fridge and put them in the microwave for 10 seconds on each side to get it back to room temperature since my son has never liked to eat cold bread.  Also, we have had NO STOMACH ISSUES as a small minority of reviewers claim the get when they eat this bread.  Hope this helps:)"
These are the only glutten-free cookies I eat. They are crunchy and go great with coffee and tea.
"The tea is absolutely delicious. It's a bit expensive, but if you like tea a lot then this is a very good purchase to make! It's my new favorite tea =)"
The package arrived even earlier than Amazon estimated.  The lemon curd is awesome and much better than having to make it myself from scratch.
I thought the whole figs would be softer for spreading but they are not. You have figs laying in a very sweet syrup. I've only tried it on toast one time and it was way to sweet to eat. The figs just lay on top unspreadable. I would not buy again. Save your money.
"I have been drinking this tea for about 2 months now. I have noticed a drastic change in my skin. I normally have really bad skin. I started to drink this for a different reason and then noticed my skin cleared up in the process. I will always drink this now, I've tried so many things for my skin but this beats them all!"
"This is a great spice for almost anything. We use it on meats, in soups and it makes a spicey garlic bread. We have been using it for some time and will continue to use it."
"I purchased this toy for my very busy-mouthed blue heeler who seems to love everything that is half-way chewable.  It seemed to be the perfect combination of things he adores:  rope, bottles, noise, and chewable plastic.  We bought treats, showed him the treats inside (and they were good and stinky - his favorites), swung the thing around in the air a couple of times.  He was very interested, and we thought ""this is it!"".  We tossed the toy in front of him.  He smells it, pawed it once, and then nothing.  OK, that's fine.  Sometimes toys take a little warm up period.  So we grabbed it up, acted like it was great fun, teased him with the rope, tossed it, ran to get it, and did all the things that usually get our heeler into a playing frenzy.  Oh, he was ready to play.  But when he'd run to the toy - that was it.  ""Oh - it's still this toy, huh?""  Nothing.  We tried multiple times - nothing.<br /><br />This toy has all the makings of a good toy, but just didn't hit the mark.  It's very durable - because it will never get played with!  What a shame, too, because it's a great looking toy.  For a dog that loves just about every toy, he doesn't like this.  Two paws down."
"I really wanted to like this product.  I hadn't heard of the brand, so visited the company's website.  I was pleased that the company stated it did not use any ingredients from China, especially in light of the well-publicized problems in that country's food supply.  (I was not, however, pleased to see that the product arrived in a box labeled ""Made in Thailand"".  I would not have willing chosen the food from the store if I had seen that label.)<br /><br />My cats don't eat wet food too often...I tend to think of it as kitty junk food.  But they are always pleased when I serve it, meowing loudly until I get the food onto a plate and down to the floor.<br /><br />On the first day, we tried the Chinese Chicken.  When I opened it, I actually thought it smelled fairly good.  (Not that I was going to taste it, but it did not smell like yucky cat food.)  The chicken was clearly identifiable as white meat chicken with bits of carrot.  The cats' first reaction was to sniff the food cautiously (I assume they were confused by the scent).  The younger cat ate a few bites and walked away.  The older cat (who is fatter and usually licks the plate clean) ate a few more bites, then he was done.<br /><br />On day two, we tried the Chicken Pot Pie.  As I was opening the can, I noticed that it sounded very watery, and upon opening the can, this was confirmed.  The food had chunks of chicken, carrots, and some type of small white bits.  The cats did not like this food as much as the Chinese Chicken.  They licked up the sauce and left.<br /><br />Except for its country of origin, I was pleased with the quality of the food.  The chicken looked like chicken, the carrots like carrots, etc.  At less than a dollar a can, it is comparable to other retail brands.  Unfortunately, my cats don't eat it, so I don't plan on buying it again.  I rated it 4 stars for the company's effort...they can't please every cat's taste buds!"
"I ordered all three of the top hits for 'habanero beef jerky' on Amazon. This is far and away the best of the three. The quality of the meat is great. The flavor is complex, and very pleasantly hot. I don't typically go for habanero stuff because I don't go foods that are so hot that you'll slap-yo'-mama. This is the best jerky I've ever had.<br /><br />I typically don't like things with MSG because they make me feel like crap, and this didn't have that effect on me at all, so they must not use much MSG."
"By far, the best chocolate in the USA. Better than Godiva, I think, but others may disagree. I LOVE See's Candies, BUT the shipping cost is almost the same as the pound of truffles.  I know shipping chocolate may be difficult during hot or cold times, but geez, something has to be done about this..... Maybe buy multiple See's products for shipping discounts? we don't have See's stores in the East, just little stands in malls during the holiday season with few choices. I WANT MY SEE'S KEY LIME WHITE CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES.  Your best bet is to search amazon's grocery and gourmet food site and find discounts. During the winter holidays, I got terrific truffles at a deep discount, regularly $100 for $20 plus free shipping."
how come you sent me instant choc.fudge pudding...<br />the order told you to send me the COOK & SERVE choc.fudge pudding....<br />you show the picture of it....<br />why couldn't send it to me....<br />it makes me wonder if I should order anything else from you....<br />pissed
"I tried Greenies on my dog about 8 years ago and he won't eat them.  So I tried dental rawhide chews which he chewed just fine.  My dog is now 13 years old and he started to swallow the dental rawhide whole and would choke on them.  I'm not sure because of his age that he tries to swallow them whole, but I'm sure it's not good for him.  I thought I would try the Greenies again because the reviews are good and they break into bits when chewed.  I order the large Greenies for him and he loves them.  I'm not sure if they changed the taste or what, but he chews them, and hopefully it will help maintain his teeth."
"My dog really likes this toy, and it occupies him for quite a while. The big problem is that the plastic cracks at the top where the lid screws on if it dropped on the floor. My dog is Jack Russell, so he's not dropping it from a very high height, yet it still breaks, so I can't imagine it with a larger dog. We have returned this toy twice, and already the third on is pretty much unusable."
I bought this as a gift. The person who received it really likes the product
"I suspect this drink is an acquired taste. After the first sip, I was reluctant to take another. The second sip was an improvement and the third even more so. By the end of the can, I was finding it fairly enjoyable.<br /><br />It was only after I had finished that I noted the Alka Seltzer-like aftermath. Yuck.<br /><br />Still, I am sure I could get used to it after a few more tries. This is, I think, the problem with the drink: I would drink it because it presents itself as being good for me, not because I was blown away with taste or a feeling of refreshment.<br /><br />I would not buy it again."
"I like these bars because they are all natural and I feel like I'm getting a snack while still eating healthy.  The sugar grams are a little high, but at least they're coming from natural sources (honey, glucose) and not refined sugars.  They're not TOO sweet... they just taste very natural - like you dipped mixed, raw nuts into honey and ate it.  They're very crunchy and satisfy hunger cravings very well.  I love to get these at Borders bookstore as a nice healthy snack option while I'm out shopping.  I looked here to try some of the other flavors, but I'm hesitant to stray from the Nut Delight because it seems the other Kind bars have more saturated fat and more grams of sugar.  The Nut Delight seems like the best option of the bunch."
I've purchased a number of Newman's Own products for me and my dogs. This is the first time that I've been completely disappointed. Don't bother with these mints - there is very little cinammon flavor and there is a flavor that tastes something like dirt.
"I'm amazed how many are being so easily fooled.  What you're seeing is a GENERIC ingredient list that covers multiple coffees.  What it is saying, based on the photo I see above, is that IF the coffee type you have is straight coffee, then all it contains is 100% arabica coffee...  But IF what you are drinking is a FLAVORED coffee, then the ingredients in it are Arabica coffee, and flavorings...  But IF what you're drinking is a DECAF variety, then it contains Arabica coffee that has been decaffeinated with Ethyl Acetate, as is standard.<br /><br />So if you're not holding a decaf variety, then there is no decaffeinated beans!  It is nothing more than generic catch all ingredients that apply to whichever variety you happen to be looking at.<br /><br />Sheesh.  Think people! lol"
"About 8 months ago I ordered a bag of English Breakfast from Davidson's and it was quite good.  Not the best but very good for the price.  After I ran out I decided to order two more bags of the English Breakfast and Assam Banaspaty.  To my great dissapointment, both are old and flavorless.  It seems like Davidson's did not store them properly.  They become bitter quickly if I brew them long enough to get any flavor out of them and I've resorted to mixing it with other tea just so it isn't a total waste.  The reality, is that I wasted $32 on tea that is only really good for making water brown.  : (<br /><br />The quality control issue and randomness of getting a good batch from Davidson's make it not a good value.  I'd rather pay more to know I'm getting consistent quality and not something that might be a total waste.<br /><br />I was really excited when I first discovered Davidson's because I drink a lot of tea and they have attractive pricing but my second order was such a huge let-down that they've lost me as a customer."
"When I was in Rome I got these for my grandfather as a gift, he is from Italy so I thought he would enjoy something from home (although I wasn't sure if these were a little Americanized, since a lot of the wording on the tin was in English). Anyway, my grandfather LOVED them. My mom thought they were too sweet, but he just loved them and now I am glad I could find them online so I can get him more!"
Where is the nutrition information for this product? what may be low sugar to one's purpose may not be low enough for another...
i had to order another 2 42 ounce bags today. the others i purchased at amazon did not last very long unfortunately. they are fresh. they are in a nice quality resealable bag to keep them fresh. they are delicious. watch for the lowest price. i am very happy with the freshness and quality of this product. it looks fresh and it smells fresh. i have ordered the 42 ounce size multiple times so far and i have no complaints.
"Finally a High Fiber cereal that tastes great!! I like mixing the Carmel with either the Honey Cluster or the Raison Cluster for an even Higher Fiber load. And the lowest price I've found these cereals in on Amazon.com (we all love saving money while being healthy, right?). Try it for 3 days and I'm sure you'll love it like I do. Thanks and have a healthy day!!!<br />Mike Buckley<br />Concord, CA"
"I am a true coffee lover  and it is my favorite beverage morning or night.  I enjoy brewing coffee at home and buy a variety of brands in varying price points.  After reading the description of the Melitta Cafe Collection I was excited to brew it.  I was extremely disappointed by how stale the coffee smelled when I opened the bag and was not impressed by the flavor after I brewed it.  It tasted like a pouch of hotel coffee, no flavor, stale and bad aroma.  The packaging looks upscale and is a great price but unfortunately the coffee was not good, I had to throw it away."
"I love this tea! I start drinking it at the first sign of infection, and it WORKS!!! I love the taste, especially with a little bit of honey! I recommend it to anyone wanting to boost their immune system in a natural way. The Yogi Teas have a strong taste, but that's exactly how I like it. I keep at least 4 boxes on hand at all times."
"consumer lab reports that in dogswell happy hips the condroitin level is not acceptable, to low"
"This is the only brand I've been able to buy from any market that uses EXTRA VIRGIN Olive Oil. Most brands use cheaper non-virgin olive oil.<br /><br />I use a can of this stuff over leafy green salad and throw in a few cherry tomatoes. Shake it up and you have delicious high protein salad with no need for saturated fat/carb stuffed dressings.<br /><br />As for the other reviewers, they are entitled to their opinions, but I need to throw out a bit of education: The reason that these Sardines are not processed in the United States is because THERE ARE NO MORE SARDINE processors in the United States. The last one was in Maine and it closed down in 2010 - this was big news already. The reasons for this are multiple: California's Sardine processing crashed after overfishing of California Sardines ruined the industry in CA for a while. The cost of buying American processed Sardines was too high of a price for Americans, who simply opted to buy the stuff processed in Morocco and Portugal.<br /><br />Blaming this particular company for sending off the fish to Vietnam is misplaced criticism. Blame yourselves for not buying American to save money only to complain about it later.<br /><br />Seriously people."
"We used to buy this coffee pretty often but the local supermarkets started cutting back on selections and raising prices and the Community whole bean coffees became expensive and not always available.  While the price of coffees seem to be rising recently, I found Amazon's price for this coffee to be a little lower than the local grocer's prices and the convenience of ordering it is unquestionable.<br /><br />Community coffee was what almost everyone drank when I was growing up in Louisiana.  However, my parents were not Community coffee fans.  When we visited neighbors and relatives, Community coffee was always served.  It was almost always overly strong dark roast that had been warmed over several times and, frankly, I didn't care for it much either.  It was not until several decades later when Community began to market a better quality of coffee in whole bean form that I started drinking it and liking it.  The Private Reserve Louisiana Blend Dark Roast reviewed here is one of their better quality coffees and my personal favorite.  It's nothing like the burnt-out tasting Community coffee I remember from my youth.  This coffee is balanced, smooth and rich.  When bought in whole bean form and ground fresh, it's a great morning cup of joe.<br /><br />Now, Community Coffee Company has been located near Baton Rouge, Louisiana, since it began.  The roasting facilities, to my knowledge, never has been located in New Orleans as a previous poster stated.  Community did open the first of several coffee houses in New Orleans in the mid 1990s, however, the coffee is not roasted in New Orleans.  Since Community Coffee is considered the Official Coffee of Louisiana and is served all over the state--including New Orleans--those who are unfamiliar with the state outside New Orleans may be under the misconception that it's New Orleans-based."
this was recommended to me by my girlfriend and my baby boy loves it!  we skipped the rice cereal and went right to oatmeal when it was time for solids.  great product!
Nutricity is the very worst ever place to order. I ordered almond butter thinking it came in a glass bottle and when I received it it was packages in plastic. I returned them and they send me an email saying they did not receive returns. When I tried to get in touch with them with their 800 number a recording said they only handle returns via email. I will never ever order from them. I highly recommend that nobody ever orders from them. When I ordered I never read that you couldn't return an item. And then to top it off I could not talk to anyone in their company they handle all via email. VERY DISSAPOINTING! DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FROM THEM.
"If you are a tea lover, this is the one for you, not bitter like a lot of English tea (I am english and I hate bitter tea!), tried tea in Australia and was thrilled to find it here."
"The product was one of the best quality I've had. It was thick and dark and strong flavor, signs of high concentration and purity. I think I paid a fair price for it too, and delivery was faster than i anticipated."
"its more expensive than the rest but let me tell you....great quality, easy to clean, to use and works great cuz i have the meals ready to go....WELL PRESERVED"
"I knew there was something wrong when I opened the outer packaging from Amazon an it contained loose coffee grounds.  I found the Breakfast Blend box to be leaking the grounds.  When I opened it I found several of the K-cups had lids that were applied off-center, thus not sealing the K-cups and the grounds were spilling out.  I have used LOTS of K-cups and have NEVER seen this before.  Poor quality control by Green Mountain with this batch.  Shame on the folks at Amazon for packaging up a box that was obviously leaking it's goods."
"I have struggled with a love-hate relationship with coffee for years.  I love coffee, however, it hates me.  In recent years, I've learned that coffee will give me terrible stomach-aches accompanied by unpleasant headaches.  I've since learned to take coffee in very small doses and then only on rare occasions.  But because I truly love a coffee indulgence, I had sincerely hoped this low acid coffee would be the answer to my problems.<br /><br />Sadly though, I have to say, this coffee is BITTER!  - I for one, am a fan of a smooth roast.  Now if you're a Starbucks fan, you may disagree with me.  I, in particular, am not at all fond of Starbucks and their coffee, and the best I can say to describe this coffee, would be to compare it to Starbucks' most bitter blend... and then some.<br /><br />If you were to ask only my taste-buds, they'd say ""no thank-you""  ...but as far as acidity is concerned, this coffee is spot-on."
"Do you love candy, but are tired of all that sugar? Well, Werther's Original has a ""Sugar Free"" version that is the best. Unlike most sugar free candy, these taste exactly like their sugar cousins and there is absolutely no after taste - none. You don't realize that they are sugar free unless someone tells you they are. Perfect for diabetics who want a snack but can't handle the sugar. Keep a package handy and you'll not be sorry."
"I found this at Walmart for $3.00, and on taste alone, it is way overpriced. I'm not sure how they pass this stuff off. Like another reviewer said, the texture is weird. It honestly made me feel like I was eating dirt. The sauce isn't good, either. I could taste just a hint, a very fleeting hint, of alfredo. Even the pasta they use tastes weird. It doesn't look very appealing when cooked, either. My husband didn't even want to try it. Never again."
I wish I had read the product description better....I didn;t realize this was sweetened...I do not like the sweetened teas...now I am stuck with 2 orders of them....but the other green tea powder is great.
"These are pretty darn good cookies!  I prefer <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00213IAUQ"">Lucy's Cinnamon Thins, 5.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 8)</a> but these are a close second.<br /><br />The cookies are crunchy, not chewy.  They do have a lot of sugar on the top but it is only noticeable if you have several at a time.  Seemed sweeter  to me than the cinnamon thins.<br /><br />Not crumbly or cakey.  No funky taste.<br /><br />Only 8 in the package, not very many at all.  Putting that in a positive light, you can consider it built-in portion control.  Handy if you're like me and sometimes happen to snack without actually paying attention to how much you are eating."
"Oh my gosh.  I bought this tea and drank my first cup in the late afternoon.  By evening I was having the worst stomach cramps and diarrhea.  I belatedly looked at the ingredients and the first one is senna leaves.  During internet research I discovered that some individuals may experience discomfort or cramping after using senna products.  Also the following admonition - don't take senna for more than a week or so or your body could end up relying on it to contract your bowels.<br /><br />Side effects can include:<br />*diarrhea<br />*intestinal cramps or gripping pains<br />*rash<br />*severe weight loss<br /><br />Senna should not be used by persons with Crone's disease, Diverticular disease and other similar diseases.<br /><br />Senna is not a daily or causal supplement and excessive use can cause liver damage.<br /><br />I wanted to die my insides hurt so bad.  Any weight loss you may accomplish with this tea may not be worth the pain.  Be aware before you use.  I threw my remaining 29 tea bags away!"
"For most of my life I drank coffee black. In my late 20's I started having stomach issues and my doctor recommended that I try drinking my coffee with milk (he tried to get me to quit, but that was not going to happen). A few days later, my stomach issues were gone.<br /><br />The problem is that I still like the taste of black coffee so I was happy to give this product a try. I brewed it in a French Press and sat down for a cup. I enjoyed the taste well enough - I like my coffee more on the bark and bitter side so this was a good fit for me. I waited to see what would happen with my stomach and I was happy to discover no problems.<br /><br />I read some other reviews by people who seem to have significant health problems. I cannot speak for people like that, but in my case this product lived up to its product description."
I used JCS Oxtail & Stew Seasoning as part of my cooking routine. The flavors blended well with my stew and vegetables to give it a unique bold flavor. I would recommend this seasoning as a woman's spice essential.
"I got this product ship one day express. Unfortunately, when it arrived and I opened it, all I saw was a big blob of melted chocolate with LITTLE macadamia nuts in the center of the holders."
I love this coffee. Great taste and great way to start your morning. If you like flavored coffee you will like this.
"Follow up purchae of a theraputic Honey. The larger quantity was what was required. Response and delivery were very good.  I do not have the knowledge to enter the ""Genuine ~ or Not"" debate. This product tastes fine and seems to have healthful properties. I am buying more."
"Since a DOP product is not readily available at my local grocery stores, I got really excited when I saw the photo of this product at the Amazon website because the photo states that this product is ""D.O.P. Certified.""<br /><br />But when I received the shipment, it was a huge disappointment.  It was a different product than what the photo promised.  (I can buy the one that was delivered to me at my local grocery stores very easily.)  Very disappointing............."
"I purchased these thinking they would just be ordinary oatmeal raisin cookies. Wrong! I like chocolate chip and I like oatmeal raisin but these combination cookies just don't work well together. I wish I had read the item listing more carefully. Even my kids said ""Blech!""."
"I would recommend this tea, it has a fresh taste with an amazing acai grape flavor that I have not had before.  It also gave me energy which I can always use!"
"Ya know, when you're on a gluten-free diet, you YEARN for those forbidden treats - like licorice! (and malted milk!) Realizing that true licorice on this challenging diet is in the past and not likely to ever be repeated in the near future, we need to alter our expectations for this treat.<br /><br />I had tried this company's raspberry laces and strawberry laces - pretty good, although not easy to chew (think bubblegum).  Not REAL licorice you understand, but pretty doggone good as an alternative.<br /><br />So I thought I try these too - how bad could they be?  I found them pleasant to chew - not tough at all.  But the taste?  Nasty and medicinal cough syrup with an aftertaste that is truly awful.<br /><br />So I'm stuck with 11 packs.<br /><br />See if you can't find a source where you can buy just ONE pack to try out.  Your tastes may be different than mine, and you might enjoy them."
"It has been 11 months since I began a gluten free diet and this is the first bread I've eaten which tastes good. It is moist and holds together well even when sliced warm out of the bread maker. I bake it in a Breadman TR 875 and follow the directions on the bag of the bread mix (which says to NOT use the gluten free setting). I'm baking bread from Pamela's bread mix for my 11 year old granddaughter who also must eat gluten free. It allows her to take sandwiches to school like the other kids. The bread toasts well and probably freezes well, but we eat it too fast to worry about that. It bakes well with added herbs, cheese, etc. It's a good product."
"These packets are so easy to use and the popcorn is good quality as well.  I signed up for the automatic delivery and if I can be critical of anything, I wish I hadn't signed up as it is too much popcorn, too often.  But otherwise, I'm happy with the purchase."
"PopChips are the best potato chips I have ever had, hands down. The BBQ flavor is strong and tangy. The calories and fat are very low. No frying, so the chips are very healthy - at least for a chip. You can satisfy that salt and crunch craving with these, no problem. But they are truly addicting - I could only find them sporadically in my local grocery (HEB and Randalls both sold them, at least for a time), but once I found them here on Amazon, I started ordering them by the case and get to save money to boot.  These chips are not like regular chips - the texture is different, I assume from the ""popping,"" but once you taste them, you will become addicted, too! One of my all-time favorite snack foods!!"
"I Was sent 3 week past ""Fresh by date"" stock. Chips are noticeably not fresh in taste. Won't order again.<br /><br />EDIT: And just to add to the dangers of expired stock one of the bags had a rat hole in it, black marks on inside of hole very obviously rat. unfortunately I put a chip in my mouth before I saw the hole.<br /><br />Very bad form amazon."
"This is an excellent product for curbing the appetite without the abundance of carbs.  They are crisp, fresh and great tasting.  Since I started eating these pork rinds, I dropped some unnecessary pounds."
"This is amazingly tasty! The whole family was excited to find these in their Christmas stocking. It is a creamy, rich treat unlike anything I have tried before. We originally bought one package at the mall, (It cost $8.00 for one!) but it was so good we wanted more! I was very excited to find it on Amazon!"
"I have never prepared anything so disgusting.  The taste was a mix of sour milk and cardboard, the smell just as bad.  I had to take the trash out because the whole room was beginning to smell.  I bake often, so I know it's not a kitchen error and I'm not that picky, but I could not stop gagging. I would recommend Pamela's brownies--add extra dark chocolate and they're delicious as ""brownie bite"" cookies (side recipe on the bag).  I even make them super healthy and use 1/2C applesause instead of oil!"
"This is great French Roast. For whatever reason, it is also cheaper (in 24-count) than the other Green Mountain Coffee roasts."
"I have been using Laci Le Beau Super Dieters Tea for years.  There is no subsitute.  Many women in my family use it as well.  This keeps me moving better than anything else and I suffer from Chronic Constipation.  I would recommend this to anyone who could use a gentle, natural laxitive.  I've never felt like I've taking a harsh stimulant, it just makes you feel & go like normal :)  I hate poop talk but this is worth sharing!  LOL"
"I'm not too sure why they named this chicken based cat food with names like ""Chinese Chicken"", but my 2 cats seem to know.  Both of them eat this stuff up like it's the last supper.<br /><br />Based upon the ingredients, I feel like I'm feeding them something far more nutritious than Fancy Feast (which they love, except for the salmon, which makes them puke)."
"This product replaced Pace's Mexican Four Cheese Salsa con Queso, which WAS the best queso dip out there.  This new product lacks the flavor of its predecessor had and the new consistency is gross.  I was very disappointed Pace/Campbells replaced a winning product with this ""dud""."
The taste was a little off to me and like with microwave popcorn not all of the bacon skins developed. Some were still very hard on the ends and others not developed at all. I bought a box of these so I tried to perfect the technique several times with not much better outcomes. All in all I will stick with the ready to go variety offered by Frito Lay and Mission.
"While I admit that the oversalted chip is addictive, I really think this one has gone too far. Skin literally peeled off my lips and inside my mouth after eating these. I am surprised that they are still on the market."
"Like the popcorn.  Maybe too much salt in the packet, but makes great flavored popcorn.  The butter packet takes a little getting used to taking out of the packet, but tastes great.  Will order more."
this is just the perfect thing to end a tired day.  the taste is smooth and warm and creamy.  i find that i look forward to having a cup while i read for a few minutes. what a treat.
"Bull Dog's Chuno has become a flavorful addition to my kitchen.  I've used it in everything: marinades, rice, stir fries, vegetables, etc.  I've also used it by itself or as a base to dipping sauces.  It also adds a nice component to homemade bbq sauce.  If I had to compare it to something it would be steak sauce.  Everytime I want to change a dish up a bit, I use chuno.  I've bought mine from somewhere else and didn't know it came in larger sizes.  The offering here is almost double the size, but it's also almost triple the price.  However, if the place I buy it from were to stop, I'd buy it here without fail.  I just wish they had the 50% less salt version."
"I start out each morning with a bowl of instant oatmeal. My favorite...Maple Brown Sugar. I love to add ground flaxseed. It adds extra flavor. Both are so good for you, why not start out your morning right. If you think oatmeal is for colder months only, think again. It goes great with my morning coffee. It's quick and easy, and very handy to take on trips. Most places have a microwave. Just heat up a little water, pour, and it's ready to eat.<br /><br />Ingredients<br />Whole Grain Rolled Oats, Sugar, Natural Flavor, Salt, Calcium Carbonate, Guar Gum, Oat Flour, Caramel Color, Reduced Iron, Vitamin A Palmitate<br /><br />Product Features<br />* Made from 100% whole grain oats<br />* Can help reduce cholesterol when part of a heart healthy diet (3g of soluble fiber daily from oatmeal, in a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease)<br />* Good source of calcium, iron and essential vitamins and minerals<br />* Good source of essential vitamins and minerals<br />* Low in saturated fat and cholesterol"
"I love Haribo Gold Bears and the Rolls of the disks, but the consistency of the Haribo Gummi Pink Grapefruit is very strange.  It is similar to the sugared sliced fruit, but with hard pieces throughout.  Some people love the sliced fruit candies, my husband does, but not me.  Hopefully my husband will like these otherwise they will go to waste."
"This seemed like a great toy, until my dogs had in for 10 seconds.<br />The end the treats come out of has rubber parts (which smell strongly of, well, rubber) and the opposite end (that no treats ever come out of) has little holes drilled in it.<br />This makes the smell of the treats MUCH stronger from the WRONG END of the toy.<br />Both of my dogs were scratching and licking at the end that they could actually SMELL the treats through, and actually backed away from the strong smell of the rubber.<br />The other treat-dispensing toys have been too easy for my dogs, but this one does not seem to be made for an animal that relies so heavily on it's sense of smell."
"I really like this product!  I first read about it in my Diabetic Living magazine and since I love peanut butter, wanted to give it a try.  While it will never replace the real thing, it had a really good roasted peanut flavor and a smooth, creamy texture.  I ate it smeared over two Corn Thin cakes, with 1/2 tbsp of reduced sugar jam and it was really satisfying, all for 104 calories! I probably won't eat this by the spoonful, like I love to do with peanut butter, but it will be great in sandwiches or with apples as a healthy snack.  I am very satisfied with the taste and texture of this peanut butter.  Yay!"
"As always, I LOVE this coffee, it's about the only kind I buy for myself.  The turn around time is terrific.  When I have about a week's worth of cups left, I order and have the next batch in perfect timing.  Very happy with everything about this product."
"Love this cereal, but I buy  a 35 oz box at Costco for $7,49 and sometimes am offered it with a $2 /box coupon. Its too high here"
"I had pretty high hopes for the Busy Bone. I have a large, active chewer (the kind of dog that has to have several bones to choose from all the time if you don't want her to chew up your bed frame). I was hoping that with the Busy Bone's 'long-lasting' promise, I might be able to just give her one of these and at least have time to wash the dishes. Why don't I describe what happened next...<br />I was in the kitchen washing the dishes. It had been about fifteen minutes since I'd given the dog the bone. Deeply absorbed in annoyance with myself for not rinsing said dishes, I was scrubbing vigorously when an awful sound met my ears: a terrible and hauntingly familiar crunching noise. The dog was eating my bed. So I go into the bedroom to scold her and even before I get a chance to look at the bed frame, I am struck by the mess she has caused. The Busy Bone somehow leaves little brown crumbles ALL over the floor. Too small and numerous to pick up by hand and too gushy for the vacuum cleaner to clean up, the oobleck has to be washed out of the carpet with a dish rag. And did I mention that they're expensive?<br />I will continue to stick with real bones that I purchase from the butcher. They're cheaper, they last longer, and they don't leave a terrible mess."
"Looked like a good deal, so I ordered the ground fennel, as well as 4 other spices and seasonings from this company, but was disappointed with them all. Zero flavor, not even the fragrance of the right herbs or spices when loosely sealed containers were opened. The dill smelled like dried musty grass, and the onion even worse. Ended up throwing them all away...save your money, DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT."
"This product is terrible.....REALLLY!!!  It taste like dog food.  I fixed one and could not eat it.<br />I threw it in the garbage. (it was that bad) I wasted 28 bucks.<br />I did not want to spend another dollar on this product, so I decided not to send it back.<br />They all went in the trash.....REALLY!!!"
"Yes, the final answer is YES, IT IS HOT!  Why even ask the question?  It is 1.5 million SVU, if you are looking add a little heat, this is not for you, if you want to cry yourself to sleep wondering ""WHY, WHY, WHY!!!???"", then you are looking at the right product, IT'S HOT!"
"Apparently the company uses very thin material for their cans as every can in the case, including interior to the case, were dented.  Fortunately non of the contents was compromised and the pumpking itself was excellent."
I love lemonade but this product does not taste good. I noticed a bad aftertaste. My husband and kids did not like the True Lemon lemonade either. I do like the lemon juice packets.
THESE TREATS ARE THE ONLY ONES MY 14 YEAR OLD DOG WILL EAT. SHE LOVES THEM.
"Yikes!  What was I thinking when I ordered 12 cans of this  stuff?  The food pantry may be getting some.<br /><br />It tastes like.....well, I can't use the words I'd like to.<br />Let's just say that it has no character at all...no distinct taste....if yu blinded yourself and then drank the coffee, I don't know if you'd even know it was coffee!<br /><br />I use just more than the amount suggessted;..;...doesn't help."
I drink these drinks after a work out and they are great! I went ahead and ordered about ten cans the other day and they arrived on time. The only thing is almost all the cans are about to expire. That is the biggest problem is they send older cans so you can't order a lot at a time. Love the drink but not sure we will order this drink from amazon again because of this.
"The Maple and Brown sugar flavor is very nice. Here are the nutrition contents for a single 43g packet:<br />Total Fat: 2g (1g mono-unsaturated)<br />Sodium: 260mg<br />Total carbs: 32g (3g dietary fiber, 12g sugar)<br />Protein: 4g<br /><br />There's 12g of Sugar in each packet, so I tend to not add anything but water and it's good enough for me.<br />Overall I would recommend trying it out."
"My dog is simply crazy about these treats. But what is really nice about them is that they are fairly healthy as well. Since they are hard treats they serve the purpose of both cleaning the teeth and providing a semi-long lasting morsel of enjoyment. In additon to that, since these treats are all natural, they do not contain as many of the fillers that are present in some of the other treats, making them extra healthy.<br /><br />The price may seem hefty for simple dog treats but these are pretty large treats that can be broken up into smaller ones and you can't beat the quality."
my cat absolutely loves these treats & they were first givin to mr by my vet who is also a friend. musc less expensive with amazon
I love the taste of this coffee but in my last order of four boxes about every other K-cup has a tear or rip in the internal filter and thus the grounds flow through into the cup of coffee which wastes the value of the coffee as drinkable.  Wolfgang needs to correct this flaw in packaging.  I will not order again because of the waste.
I tried this along with two of my children and we all agreed that it tastes like spoiled OJ but fizzier. Maybe it would be an acquired taste but I won't  be drinking it again to find out.<br /><br />Oddly enough the black cherry version is quite good.
This coffee has a wonderful aroma.  I usually don't drink coffee with cream and sugar but I like this particular flavor better with a little cream and sugar.
"I have two cats who are very picky,  I'm always trying to find treats to tempt them.  I found the Purina Friskies Indoor Adventures Crunchy but it seems there are other cats out there who demand their owners buy these treats.  I love that I can order this product on a subscription shipping schedule which means I will never run out of their favorite treat."
"High quality coca products do not have a paper wraps since they can harbor dirt and bacteria and the printing ink can change or contaminate the delicate flavor of the tea bags.<br />Organic coca tea bags do not contain preservatives or additives; therefore they must be properly stored. All coca tea  Air Tight Bags are re-sealable with zip lock closures and once opened the bags must be kept closed at all time to avoid contamination in a dry, cool, dark place away from strong-flavored foods.  An extra airtight container is recommended when the tea is stored over one month.<br />Do not store coca tea  products inside a refrigerator if you have produce inside. Many fruits and vegetables, especially if they have been damaged, give off ethylene gas as they ripen. Coca tea bags are very sensitive to the presence of even very low levels of ethylene gas. The refrigerator acts as a trap for the ethylene gas given off by the generating varieties, allowing it to build up to damaging levels. Although not hazardous to humans, the ethylene gas leads to the early aging and rotting of the tea."
"Exactly what I wanted. My parents have an upgraded version, but I'm perfectly content with this mid-range unit.<br /><br />One thing to note, if you look at the picture of the box, there's a coupon there for a free box of coffee, which you cannot use - it's to be used only in conjunction with a physical purchase of the unit, which is kind of a bummer, to be honest.  But to be fair, it's not listed as part of the description, only something you'd notice if, like me, you looked at the picture of the box very closely before your purchase.<br /><br />I'm hoping it holds up well, because all of a sudden I am drinking A LOT more coffee!<br /><br />UPDATE: GRRR! So. Many. Problems.  First problem was all of a sudden it started making super weak coffee - Xtra bold, french roast, whatever, it was weak.  A little googling suggested that maybe the seal wasn't tight at the top needle. A bit of fiddling with the silicon doughnut seal seemed to fix that. I was back in love.  (FWIW, Keurig's customer service just sent me a free box of coffee as their ""fix."") Now in the last week it's begun the dreaded ""half cup"" syndrome.  I've only had it about a month and had already descaled (attempting to fix the weak coffee problem from before), but descaled again and cleaned the needles, and that seems to help, for about four cups. Then the damn thing brews half cups again. Grrrrr.  I suspect it'll be on its way back to Keurig this week - thank goodness I remembered to register & kept the box.<br /><br />I'm sorry folks, but for the price of these things I expect better. Much better - like a unit that works. Imagine how picky I am."
These really are amazing chips. Don't be put off by one of the cheeses being blue cheese...it is so subtle that even blue cheese haters (like me)will enjoy these.
I bought these K-cups along with the Coffee People Wake Up Call Bold and they were both great.  We bought our Keurig about 6 months ago and I've been searching for something that really tasted good and finally found it.  You can run this twice for a travel size mug and have the coffee be sufficiently bold and not go broke in the process.
"Ingredients<br /><br />organic whole wheat pastry flour, organic whole grain corn flour, organic wheat gluten, organic evaporated cane juice sugar, baking powder (monocalcium phosphate, bicarbonate of soda, cornstarch), sea salt.<br /><br />Pancakes<br /><br />Blend 1 cup mix, 1 egg, 1 Tbsp. oil and 3/4 cup cold water.

"Started out OK, but after a few weeks my dog decided she didn't like the taste all that much, became picky and wouldn't finish her feedings. I ended up discarding a half-bag and switching to Wellness brand Puppy mix. Canidae does produce very dense, dark stools so if you have to pick up poop this makes it easy. With a 1-acre fenced yard I don't bother."
"I purchased these tonight, the package says best by (Dec 2009) approximately 3 months from now...these are horrible! The aroma is offensive and the taste is even more offensive. I didn't even finish one piece of the dried peaches. I have tasted other brands that were better, I'm looking for those! Don't waste your money! Honest!"
"I took 3 sips of these tea, and I nearly gagged.  I think it tastes spicy, like nutmeg.  I can't stand the taste or smell of nutmeg, so I can't drink this tea. Just my two cents."
"My son had this Jablum roasted and ground coffee brought back from Jamaica and paid a lot for it.  I have drunk blue mountain for years when I can but this was shocking.  It tasted stale when you opened the bag and even worse when you drank it.  It was definitely off.  He bought 5 bags and every one we tried was the same.  I would never buy another.  We had bought another brand in a tin from Jamaica which was fine.  I think this is a con.  You get all the rubbish about it being tested in Jamaica, well I dont know who tests it but definitely not someone who likes good coffee.  I just dont understand how people say its any good. Maybe having paid so much for it its like the emperor's new clothes."
Received this product much sooner than promised. Seeds grow as claimed and plant is great. My cat loves it. Highly recommend product and seller.
"Original description and order said ""Assorted"" chocolates. What I got--weeks (!) later--was one pack of all white chocolates (the least desirable). Not worth the bother of returning even with Prime. Might be better just buying at local store (same or cheaper price) when you can see what you get."
"After trying the Namaste pizza crust I was blown away--Delicous!  Possibly, the best pizza crust I've ever had.  So, I tried their Cheez Pasta thinking it would be great as well.  Big surprise.  It was awful.  I could barely tolerate one bite of it.  I, like one of the other reviewers, will save the pasta but make my own cheese sauce.  The cheese sauce smelled and looked terrible.  Do not waste your money on this product!"
"These cookies are simply scrumptious! I gave my mother some as a gift, since she loves lemon flavored desserts. What a hit! They became her instant favorites, and she begged me to get her some more. They are small and round, about the size of a large marble, with a crisp, light consistency that just melts away in your mouth, covered with powdered sugar for sweetness, combined with that tart little zing of lemon. A very elegant and grown-up sort of cookie. I love them, too. Highly recommended!"
"Some of the best dried apples I've had. I like the light cinnamon, and they're not too dry like most of them. Slightly sweet and not sour at all.<br /><br />Packaging is good and I love the organic products! Newman's Own is a superior brand.<br /><br />It's hard to find all of the brands items in the shops, so Amazon is a great place to buy these, especially in bulk w/ free shipping."
Somebody sent a package of this to where I work and it was FABULOUS. The one I had was two ounces in a shrink-wrapped package. Would be great for hiking or wherever a single portion is wanted.
"These are great snacks.  Being able to cook them fresh really makes them taste better than the average pre-cooked store bought ones.  Great alternative to popcorn.  I ordered both the Hot & Spicy and the Original.  I prefer the Hot & Spicy, but I like spicy foods.  You can't go wrong with either one."
"I LOVE the taste of ginger in any form, and have never before had an adverse reaction to a non-sugared sweetener. That said, this is the worst tasting ginger ale known to humankind.<br />There is no ginger taste whatsoever. The only taste, initially, is that of smoked meat -- similar to that of bacon. To add insult to injury, a split second later, an overpowering bitterness invades one's mouth, tongue, and any other digestive body part that comes in contact with this vile concoction."
"These are the best training treats you can buy.  My dog is more motivated in doggie class because of these treats than any other dog in class.  He loves these treats so much that he is not very interested in most other dog treats, which keeps life simple."
"My dog loves this toy. I have a 60lb Shepard mix and she will spend hours with this thing. She is the type of dog to scarf down her food in a second flat if it's in a bowl, so I give her breakfast and dinner in this thing and it can take upwards of 2 hours for her to get it all out. I notice that she doesn't act as hungry or bored during the rest of the day which is great! I also have a kong toy that I would fill with treats but that was way too easy for her. The bottle is made out of hard plastic and so far she has hardly made a dent in it. Beyond a collar and leash this is by far one of the best investments I have ever made for my pup. I would recommend this for my friends!<br /><br />Emily"
"My daughter was diagnosed with celiac about 2 years ago, and has gone without pancakes ever since...until I happened to come across this at the grocery store.  Really wasn't expecting good results - but it's very good!  The non-celiac members of the family even prefer the gf version to the regular!  Try it!"
"StumbleUpon users, be wary. I was browsing when I stumbled upon an article about miracle berries- a cool new fad that apparently causes things to taste different than they normally would. Naturally, I tried to see where I could get my hands on some.<br /><br />Once I found the mberry Miracle Fruit Tablets, I did some research. I always look at a lot of reviews and alternatives before buying anything on Amazon. The price was relatively cheap, I figured, if it worked as advertised. The aggressive claims on the product's page and the Amazon user reviews also furthered my need to investigate this mystery product, so I bought two packs- one for me and one for my friend.<br /><br />After both of us trying the Miracle Berry tablets, I'd have to say that the product is extremely overhyped, and the experience was, unfortunately, lacking.<br /><br />The way mberry talks about their tablets, you'd expect to have a Willy Wonka-esque food tasting bonanza. Sadly, this isn't the case, and though the tablets do change the flavors of many foods to a degree, it's much more subtle than you'd probably like- no Snozzberries here. I found this to be the case for me, and I was hoping maybe my taste buds were maybe just a bit more dull, but my friend reported the same experience.<br /><br />I'm giving the product 2 stars, not because I hated the product, but because I was very let down with the experience and taking that fact into consideration, I don't think it's worth the money."
"This is not a sausage, this is paste in a plastic tube which is shaped like a sausage. Then you cut the tube off and you're left with a log of mash. As one other reviewer mentioned, it'd be better (and more honest) if this came in a tub.<br /><br />The taste is fine, but not remarkable in any way. I'm not sure how this product is better than you putting tofu, TSP and spices in a blender and then shaping it like poop.<br /><br />Usually vegan fake meats are at least texturally close, and while they can't approximate meat exactly they are at least trying. Soyrizo makes no attempt (other than the plastic packaging) at being what it claims to replace.<br /><br />It is a pain in the butt to cook as it has no structure at all, and it burns readily. I cooked half at a high temperature like the packaging suggested - it burned quickly! Then I cooked the other half at a low temperature, cut up into smaller poops so I could roll them over. Regardless of how long it was cooked, it did not dry out or become more solid.<br /><br />I was very very disappointed by this Soyrizo and will not buy it again."
"I was excited to buy these ""chips"" and try them out since they are supposed to be a healthier alternative. But these things are super super salty.  What it lacks in oil, it makes up for in salt.  I would not consider these things healthy at all.  I bought these for my toddler but I didn't know why he only ate 2 pieces before giving up until I tasted them myself. I even opened a 2nd and 3rd bag just to make sure the first bag wasn't just a fluke.  Don't waste your money on these.  Stick w/ the baked chips!"
This soup has no flavor. Broth had a slimy consistency instead of a liquid-y one. I was so disappointed.
"First of all, I have owned a Keurig for about 4 years now, and I've tried lot's of coffee.  During that time, I have had an occasion k cup that didn't function correctly and loaded the brew with grounds.<br /><br />I probably should have returned these before I bothered to open the second box.  Since I drink my coffee from a thermal cup, I can tell you that taking that last drink to find your mouth full of coffee grounds stinks.<br /><br />I have had to throw out at least 6 cups of coffee.  Its a bit like Russian Roulette, and I've started straining it after I brew it.<br /><br />I know that its not my brewer because it is not happening with the Green Mountain, Timothy's or Tully's that I also use.  The good cups are a bit weak for my taste, but the flavor is ok.  Definitely prefer not to waste $'s on a product with a manufacturing defect."
"Bought Uncle Ray's Wavy's 16 oz potato chips because purchased  Uncle Ray's 16 oz barbque potato chips in the past and was very pleased. Oh how wrong we were.  Do not purchase the Wavy's chips!!!!!!!!!!  They are the quality of buying a no name bag of chips from a roadside service station store; broken, brown, very poor quality.  Very, very disappointed.  DO NOT.......DO NOT......DO NOT purchase Uncle Ray's 16 oz Wavy potato chips<br /><br />OCTOBER 03, 2012<br /><br />Bought Uncle Ray's sour cream and onion flavored chips for the 5th shipment with extreme disappointment. The other (4) four shipments were very good which is why we continued to buy this flavor.<br /><br />The additive that when you like an item and start to buy a lot, it will change for the worse is proving to be true for us.  This shipment of chips are awful.  Bags are extremely deflated, so was expecting to be stale; however, was not so - cannot not explain the semi-flat bags.  Chips seem to be the bottom of the barrel flakes.  You know when you try to salt your food and the top comes off, the seasoning on these chips is like that.  It appears that the top came off a full bottle or these are the bottom of the barrel crumbled chips where the seasoning has covered the chips too, too much. .  We just opened (3)three bags just now because the first bags was awful, opened second bag - awful, opened 3rd bag - also was awful.  LEFT WITH 6 MORE ,PROBABLY NOT EDIBLE, BAGS. THE CHIPS REALLY APPEAR TO BE THE NOT SO FRESH, BURNED/BOTTOM OF THE BARREL, GET RID OF LEFTOVERS.  VERY, VERY, DISAPPOINTED.  WILL NOT BUY AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"The SALSA smelled delicious, as I think it probably was - but, unfortunately, the person, at AMAZON, that is a packer (there is probably several) had very little ""stuffing"" to work with, especially on the bottoms.  Therefore, the bottoms were broken on all three bottles. As I reached for my computer; I was told NO RETURNS (cause it's a food item).  I then looked for a CUSTOMER SERVICE tag; and I found ""none"" on their NEW FACE LIFT.  THEY SEEM TO BE PROUD OF THEIR NEW FACE LIFT BUT...THEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A PLACE TO CONTACT THEM IN EMERGENCIES!  LIKE: I BUY A LOT OF ""STUFF"" AND IT ALL COMES IN STYROFOAM BOXES.  NEVER WOULD I SHIP THINGS<br />ESPECIALLY SALSA - IN A CARDBOARD BOX WITH JUST A STRIPE OF LARGE BUBBLE WRAP ON IT.  NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE CARRIER (FED EX) IS CAREFUL, IT'S GOING TO BREAK SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE.  ESPECIALLY IN AN ALL GLASS CONTAINER!  BARBARA L. S."
"I bought these graham sticks based on their excellent reviews and having purchased Earth's Best organic vanilla cookies, had high hopes for a healthy snack to serve my kids.  Needless to say, I should have purchased one box at the grocery store first before committing to 6 boxes through Amazon (which you are unable to return -even unopened boxes- since this is a food item).  The crackers smelled strange even before tasting them.  My 5 year old turned up her nose and refused to eat them anymore after trying a few.  I wish I could describe the taste, but it would be really hard.  It may sound strange for an organic food, but it was almost like a faint chemical smell.  At best, I can say that they weren't anything like a regular graham cracker flavor (even as an organic option they should have a better taste).  My 2 year old did eat some of them without complaint, so I am hoping she will tolerate them through 6 boxes so I feel like I did not waste my money.  Good price, but definitely test one box first to see if you like them."
My favorite blend of coffee for my Keurig. I've tried about 15 different flavors but this is by far my favorite.  Very smooth and not overpowering or bitter.  Was buying at Walmart but they stopped stocking it.  Found it at Amazon for the same price.
"I don't buy a lot of canned salmon, but I am buying this again.  Acquired addictive taste.  It really compliments cream cheese."
"These are supposed to be cherry and brandy filled chocolates. If they contain brandy, it is too subtle for me to detect. A clue to the cause may be the stickiness of the package and the cracks in the candies. It appears they were mistreated at some point and may have leaked. But the box they came in shows no damage. A friend speculated that airline decompression burst them. Maybe, but other imported chocolates don't suffer this problem.<br /><br />I should also mention that the chocolate tastes a little bit dusty on the outside.<br /><br />I can't really recommend these Laroshell candies. There are other brands which are quite good."
"Great deal! Love this product. Trying to get away from diet soda and nutrasweet.  This is a healthy, refreshing option!"
I bought this brand and it was just horrible. Amazon needs to source and offer 3 Ladies brand wrappers as they are just superior to anything out on the market today.
Got this free with another order I placed.  I couldn't believe how much the cats loved it. I will buy again for sure.
"I bought a 40 sampler pack from the caveman bakery website. It's not exactly like a cookie consistency however the texture and chewiness of the cookie I like. They kind of remind me of like those natural nut and fruit bars, like kind or something. Of the ones I've tried, Alpine and Tropical are my favorites mainly because alpine has hazelnut and tropical has a coconut taste in it. The least favorite that I've tried is either the rainforest, it has a strong taste of ginger and I'm not a fan of ginger. The other ones are pretty good too. However, I didn't realize that these cookies were so small, but I guess based on the big portions of today's society, this is a normal portion.<br /><br />Overall its good, would I buy again? Maybe if I was on a strict gluten-free diet."
"Popchips are the best find I have found in a long time.  You want to eat healthy, and at the same time sometimes, you want something yummy.  Regular chips are high in fat, low fat chips give you stomach problems, baked chips taste not good to me, Popchips a little bit of heaven.  4 grams of fat vs. 10 of regular chips, they use sea salt, they crunch, and to me taste like regular chips minus the grease.  As usual, things that taste good and are made healthy cost more than the high fat item, that is just the way it seems to work.  However, this treat in my opinion is worth your money, as so many other healthy treats are expensive and taste not so great.  I hope you will enjoy them I do and my family does too."
Given the recent issues with products made in China I have decided to not buy any food products from there so I won't be buying anymore of this snack.  If they ever switch to made in the U.S. I'll buy it again as I did like it.
"DESCRIPTION:<br />> Blue Diamond Roasted-Salted Almonds are moderately roasted with canola, safflower, or sunflower oil (but not oily or greasy), and lightly salted.  These are ""heart healthy"" oils which are actually good for you, as is the almond oil itself.  Roasted Salted Almonds are available in bags or small cans small.<br />> Blue Diamond Smokehouse Almonds are similar with wonderful smokey flavor.  At this time Smokehouse Almonds are available from Amazon only in 16 oz (and smaller) bags.<br />> I have not tried the ""lightly salted"" variety but I presume that they have almost no salt.<br /><br />CANS vs BAGS<br />Various types of Blue Diamond Almonds are available in bags or small cans.  The small cans (3 1/4"" in diameter by 2 3/8"" high) are very convenient and assure that the almonds stay fresh until openned, and afterward, because they don't stay ""openned"" long (it is easy to eat a whole can at one setting).  Arguably the bags more environmentally friendly, but you don't get much of a price break for the much cheaper packaging.  I prefer the convenience and freshness of the cans.<br /><br />EVALUATION: Excellent and flavorful.  Well roasted and crunchy.  I cannot decide which I like best: the Roasted Salted or the Smokehouse.  Although not oily, the roasting oil does effect the flavor.  Whether that's a good thing or not is a matter of individual tastes.  I happen to like the roasted-in-oil flavor.<br /><br />LESS ROASTED ALMONDS<br />If you prefer less-roasted almonds, roasted without added oil, consider <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COJ85G"">Back To Nature California Almonds, Sea Salt Roasted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />UNROASTED ALMONDS<br />Unroasted almonds are available <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001COE1AI"">Back To Nature California Almonds, Unroasted & Unsalted, 11-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 3)</a> but beware that thorough roasting makes almonds more digestable.  Unroasted almonds are susceptable to fungus which can be carcinogenic.  While commercial domestic almonds sold in the US do not contain significant levels of cyanide, bitter almonds, (which have a much richer almond flavor, particular in baked goods).  Indeed natural almond extract is made from bitter almonds---artificial almond extract is safer.  Bitter almonds are sometimes illegally sold in the US and are often encountered in other countries, and do contain dangerous levels of cyanide when raw.  7-10 raw bitter almonds can kill a child.  Moreover, a child raised on raw almonds may conclude that raw peach pits (essentially a variety of almonds) are safe to eat---they are NOT.  The safest practice is NOT to eat unroasted almonds."
"I love these healthy dog treats. My dog has trouble with a lot of processed dog foods and treats. These are a great way to give her a little something extra when she's a good girl and not have to worry if she will get sick or have an allergic reaction. I will warn you, though, they often arrive broken in pieces, even though they are packed fairly well. They are very delicate, crispy treats. I usually break them down into pieces anyway, so it isn't much of a drawback for me, but it may bother some of you."
Husband and Grandaughter LOVE this cocoa... Make it for them all the time as I drink my coffee.. My husband is a very picky person but for some reason he really likes this one product and wants me to keep it in stock here at the house.. Loves it at night after dinner on cold evenings.
I bought this last year-threw it out-I would not buy this for 1 cent-why is Amazon selling such an inferior product??
"As the initial reviewer stated, the biggest issue with this product is its durability, or lack thereof.<br /><br />With the Nylabone brand name on it and a price approaching $10 you might be under the impression that this will last quite awhile.  I timed how long it took my dog to eat the largest one they make (the one shaped like a fist).  It took him 11 minutes to leisurely eat and about 2 minutes to 'clean up' the mess.  If he were actually hungry he probably could have done it a few minutes faster.  So, almost a dollar a minute for this product when viewed as an entertainment/chew toy product.  It's possible to get them for about half price from some of the amazon vendors but this only makes sense when buying large quantities due to the expense of shipping on small orders from them.<br /><br />I was hoping this might last awhile and be better for him than the 'plastic' Nylabone products which exit the dog in solid chunks (eww!).<br /><br />My dog thoroughly enjoyed this but at these prices I can't justify it."
"I don't like to write a poor review. The seller was prompt in responding. There was some miscommunication in the beginning about mailing address, which was quickly resolved. However, I was told two weeks ago, a new product had been mailed.... it never came, as patiently as I waited and even commuicated with the seller. When I finally received it, today the post mark date was exactly one week ago to today's date, meaning they did not mail it when they said they did. The post mark date was nearly a week after the date they told me they sent a new product.<br /><br />The plant was ok - I was really disappointed - expecting something somewhat bigger and prettier."
"Busy Buddy Kibble Nibble has been a great toy for my dog, but Tug-a-Jug was not.  Within 10 minutes, she had gnawed the ""challenge"" rope into 6 pieces.  Maybe it's good for an older dog but definitely not for my vigorously chewing 8-month-old puppy!"
"My pup and I really enjoyed this in the beginning.  She very quickly learned how to hold the rope with one paw and tip the bottle with the other to get food out.  We were starting to learn some other things (adding balls inside to change how the food fell out, etc).  Screwing the cap on was always difficult, with it needing to be lined up exactly right.  Soon, however, the threads broke off the bottle so that we could no longer screw the ""cap"" on.  Now it is useless."
I ordered the ener g brand because that is the brand of bread we had a Disney and the kids (and one adult celiac) were very excited about everything they had there.  These brownies do not measure up to the bread that ener g makes.  I've never met a brownie I didn't like but I couldn't eat it (even with ice cream).  The clear sign was when I had to throw some away.  They will eat them if they are desperate for something gluten free.  Anyone who has been dealing with gluten free products probably already knows to freeze the items until you get ready to use them.  They mold quickly.
"My dog went for it from the start. I was using the same brand but a lower quality food and my dog still likes both, but I'm switching to the Instinct line for quality"
Was looking forward to this. What a disapointment. It was stale. I didn't even try to return because I was just that fed up and looked at it as a lesson learned. Trust you me this is not the first food item I ordered on line nor was it the first stale one. Lesson learned is don't buy food on line anymore.
"I bought these for my vegan father who LOVES the curry kale chips by Rhythm Superfoods (my 22 month old daughter, husband and I also like them)!<br /><br />Thought I would give him a new kale chip flavor--BBQ--as part of his Christmas gift. Although a different brand than we typically eat, they sounded good. First, I was disappointed to see these chips are not kale in its natural curly form but pressed into round, dog-snack-looking discs. Luckily I tried them before giving them. I spit it right out! Was it just me? My husband also tried one and couldn't finish even one chip.<br /><br />I have a pack of 4 that cannot be returned... what a waste of food and money!"
"Great noodles for low calorie, low carb diet. I love them to make Chicken Alfredo. It is good with any pasta dish. This item is hard to find in stores and this is a great price!"
"you won't BELIEVE how many ways this product has saved my life!  I only gave it one star because i'm so dehydrated from drinking regular water all week because i ran out of money before my penta ran out.  when i can afford another shipment, i'll jack it back up to 5 STARS!<br />seriously, folks-- SOME waters just run through your system and you pee them all out right away.  not PENTA! it sticks to your ribs like oatmeal, restoring your body's natural tendencies to develop sympathetic electrolytic rehydration.  but it won't weigh you down!<br />other things i have noticed about this product:<br /><br />I accidentally dropped my cell phone into a glass of it, and when i pulled it out, it had better reception!<br />I was going to discipline my kids after they tried to clean my computer with it, until i discovered that it IMPROVED its functionality!<br />I threw some jumping beans into the bottle, and the next day i had a pair of baby pogo sticks growing in my refrigerator!<br /><br />hey, if you fill up your solar shower with this stuff, you won't even need soap.  it comes at a price, but it's so super!<br /><br />If you are tired with the uninvigorating, boring old swill other people call ""water"", or are lethargic from all that unenhanced blah that's so bad they can't attach a higher market value to, and you're so over the cheap, readily available and monitored CRAP your McBurbia proffers, then look no further."
"My youngest cat goes insane over this stuff!  (Which is good -- she's the reason we had to seek out a new food that was for both adults and kittens.)  My older cat took a few weeks to adapt to the creamier texture, compared to her ""favorite"" canned food, although she loved the taste right away.  Once she got used to it, we started going through this case like it was going out of style and I had to buy more!  I have noticed much less smelly litter boxes since we got into this case, compared to many of the foods we use ... that was a big bonus for me, and enough to convince me to put this into our regular rotation of canned foods."
"Almost all the teas in this line from Lipton are such careless mixtures of white+green, green+black, rooibos+green etc that there is no way to buy and know how much caffeine you're getting.  That's the first problem.  The name of each of these pyramid teas says you're getting 1 tea, when in fact you are getting at least 2, and then a mountain of other ingredients -- most of which are not even hinted at by the name.<br /><br />It's true, white tea is the first ingredient listed.  Then green tea.  Then apple pieces.  Then a litany of all the cheap add-ins available to fill a tea bag.  The pom -- is barely there at all, in the form of juice concentrated and then powdered into bits.  And blueberry is so far down the list that it's barely there at all.<br /><br />Of 15 listed ingredients, all the fruit (except the apple) are listed AFTER cornstarch and ""natural flavor"".<br /><br />What kind of tea is this that has blueberry and pom in the name -- yet has more cornstarch and the mysterious ""natural flavor"" than the microscopic bits of fruit and juice?<br /><br />CORNSTARCH?  In tea?  forget this stuff and find some Numi, or Republic of Tea, or Stash, or Celestial Seasonings tea that has the actual tea (white? green? black? rooibos? mint? chamomile?) in the name -- and then only minimal anything-else.  No fillers.  No thickeners.  No crap.  Almost any of the name companies in this price range give you more actual tea (and identifiable other ingredients) than this.<br /><br />And it tastes bad. The ""white tea"" they are using tastes astringent and peppery.<br /><br />Go for full leaf from a reputable tea merchant to be sure you're not getting a dainty little bag full of straw and leftovers -- which this is."
"8.3 ounces and a tad expensive is what I'd say about this drink.34 grams of sugar is also a negative for me. I'm not a sugar lover. All in all not big enough to quench my thirst,and not delicious enough to find me coming back for more.Natural but not that intensely citrus."
"I purchased this for my Westie because I work and she's home alone in her crate most of the day. I wanted to give her something to stimulate her mind, so she didn't get too bored while I was away. I received many recommendations on this toy, and read many great reviews. Here are my issues with it.<br /><br />1) My dog may only be 16 lbs., but she's an extreme chewer. The product says it's durable, but it's not. She almost had it chewed through by day one.<br /><br />2) Apparently, my dog is a genius. She figured out how to dispense the treats, just not the way they're supposed to be dispensed. She unraveled the rope. Pulled it out and dumped the treats out. Now, the toy is useless.<br /><br />I think it would be a great toy for a dog that doesn't like to chew and can't figure out a work around to dispensing the treats. For extreme chewers, and smart dogs, it's not durable or stimulating enough for them."
"No need to review the product because I'm sure most people in the U.S. who are able to eat peanuts have had these.  These arrived fresh and in good condition.  I can't give even peanut M&Ms more than 4 stars since I think the chocolate used in these products keeps getting worse and worse over time; but they are still a fun, enjoyable snack.<br /><br />I ordered this along with a box of Snickers with Almonds, and Amazon included, as part of my Prime membership, a free ""cold pack"".<br /><br />This consisted of a very thick and sturdy Styrofoam lidded box, in which the candies were packed, along with four large cold-pack freezable units.<br /><br />The item was in shipping transit for approximately 3 days, and delivered to a hot, humid region.<br /><br />Upon opening the container, I found that the candies were still cold and in good condition, although the cold-packs were no longer frozen or really cold.<br /><br />Amazon did a great job on packing this.  Thought I would share that, in case others are concerned about ordering such products from this company.  I'm even keeping the Styrofoam chest and cold-packs for re-use, since they are of pretty nice quality."
Ive had some tasty nuts before but these are exceptionaly good. try them ! im very happy with this product
"Puroast Low Acid French Roast<br /><br />This is a dark roast coffee, and it was difficult to find out if it was decaffeinated or caffeinated, but it appears to be caffeinated. The packaging is not reseal-able to maintain freshness. The grind is a very fine powder, but works great with my French press. The taste and smell of the coffee was on-par with local brands and the name brands. I didn't find it to be particularly better than the coffee I normally drink, and the low acid part wasn't a big seller for me. I always take my coffee black without any cream, milk, or sugar, and even with double the normal dosage I use, the coffee didn't give me that jolt I wanted. The good news is that the after taste isn't as strong.<br /><br />Overall: 4/5 stars, great if you like coffee but cannot handle the acid, but I didn't find it to be a better coffee than less expensive store brand coffee."
"Advertised as an all natural, gluten free,healthier snack, we tried the BBQ & Sour Cream & Onion flavors.  We have a slight preference for the BBQ over the Sour Cream & Onion because the BBQ has a little more flavor. However, both leave a slightly strange aftertaste shortly after consuming a single serving bag.<br /><br />The chip crunch is great and adds to the satisfaction of eating the chip.<br /><br />Overall, a nice snack.  For flavor; however, we prefer Veggie Chips.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0041BSZGA"">Sensible Portions Veggie Snacks Variety - 24 Bags</a> (especially the Rosemary flavored straws)."
"This was a very disappointing coffee.  It is very weak, I had to set my brew to a medium just to get any flavor from it and  large is very watered down. I would find something different before buying this again."
"If there is one thing our dog likes, it is the liver biscotti dog treats.  These make the best rewards and training treats we have used."
All our kitties love these treats. They come running at treat time. It's their favorite treat. Seafood is a favorite flavor.
"I love peanuts and I also love salt but these nuts have very little taste EXCEPT salt.  Believe me, there is not much that I consider ""too salty"" but these certainly qualify.  Also, as another reviewer mentioned, they are bland - not peanut-y.  Trader Joe's ""blister peanuts"" are far superior to these. Indeed, I think a commercial brand like Planters is probably superior (and much cheaper).  After this purchase, I am still on the lookout for peanuts better than I can purchase in the grocery store.<br />Sorry I got them."
"My kids love these things! They've been eating them since they were little and now, in high school they are still eating them. The Flavor Blasted are the best and I eat them as well."
Very firm small pieces with an intense licorice flavor. I love black licorice and have been trying different gluten free options. I will be ordering more of this one.
Yum...yum.. yum.. They are delicous I took them in to a Christmas party at work and they were a hit.
"I am sorry to say I had trouble with the cups themselves. Each time I used them, my machine would say ""decalcify"" which I did the first time. When I used them the 2nd and 3rd times, the problem occurred again. I was able to clear the hot water spout with a toothpick, which remedied the problem. I will not use them again, though, because I don't want to have to do that after every use."
"I bought a case of these on sale.  I haven't eaten them since college.  I grabbed the last can (&lt;2 weeks after they arrived) and sat down to enjoy it.  The microwave can/lid works really well.  Nothing spilled, no mess to clean up.  The ravioli could have had meat (as advertised) cheese or even spinach inside... it's really hard to tell.  The pasta is soft and gooey.  My kids are begging for more.  This must be kid comfort food.<br /><br />Somehow I doubt it's really nutritious.  I believe everything in moderation is ok though...  Think I'll wait for a few months before ordering another case."
"I've tried this with multiple foods, at different times, and with anywhere between one and three tablets, all held on different areas of the tongue. While I could swear there were minor changes at low quantities, this didn't change no matter how many were tried. I'm sure that the Miracle Berries are authentic, but my friend and I didn't experience anything as incredible as people say, or even anything noteworthy. I would go for the actual fruit next time."
"I baked a few pork steaks bone in and the batter came out golden and crispy. The meat was cooked thoroughly and tender. The flavor wasn't too salty.<br /><br />This isn't hard to make of course. You simply put the contents of the packets into a bag, wet the meat you intend to batter and shake to coat them. You then put them on the baking pan and bake. I think we all know that by the name of the product.<br /><br />It only took about 30 minutes of baking. I served it with rice and veggies along with some gravy."
"This is a good gum to chew if you are looking to switch from sugared to sugarless gum. It's sweet, and doesn't have a strong aspartame taste, for being sugar-free. It doesn't last 'forever' like the commercials and 'Forever Fruit' name would lead you to believe, but the flavor lasts longer than a lot of sugarless gums, and it has a nice kick of flavor when you first bite in. Everyone in my family likes this flavor of Stride.<br /><br />Don't confuse this with the darker-but-similar-colored-packaging 'Mandarin' flavor."
"With the departure of Starbucks coffees, I reluctantly switched back to the other t-discs carried by local stores. I tried, I really did. But, it seemed like every other one I tried, which was basically every other one made, including the European t-discs, were not rich enough to satisfy me. I finally gave up and went back to an old fashioned drip coffeemaker so that I could make a nice, rich cup. I was still frustrated by the waste, since I'm the only coffee drinker in my home. Plus, being a basically lazy person, I didn't enjoy filling the reservoir every time I wanted to brew a pot, washing the pot out afterwards, or cleaning out the grounds from the filter.Recently, Tassimo/Gevalia came out with a dark house blend. The front of the package noted: ""New! If you like Starbucks House Blend, try this!"" As a last shot attempt before packing up my Tassimo for storage, I purchased this new t-disc coffee. Tasting my first sip, I was so HAPPY. Really really HAPPY! My coffee is so important to me, and the Gevalia Dark House Blend is AMAZING!!!! It's a rich, full bodied cup of coffee, and as I drink this day after day, I'm starting to think it's even better than my old favorite Starbucks flavors. It's as bold as Starbucks with no bitterness at all. I'd love to hear what others think of this. I am very pleased with it, and I'm so glad that I am able to go back to the simplicity of using my Tassimo brewer, because they make a great t-disc again!"
Love this Keurig Coffee; of course when they started offering it in a 50 pack just could not resist!!! You get a real coffee with robust taste and smoothness! Can't get enough of it. We have many Keurigs and even the small one for on the go! This coffee is good all day long!
The packaging was very bad it arrived crushed. It was hardly eatable. Do not buy from this site. It arrives all broken and in pieces. I would not recommend
"If you want the best wild rice, buy the regular kind. This ""quick cook"" type is not near the taste quality of the regular/ 40 minute cook time rice.,"
OK but too Salty.  they should make a low sodium version.  The spicy is better.
"One of the best for our 11 year old Jack Russell mix.<br />I always check to make the first ingredient is meat or chicken, not a byproduct."
"The cups to make my own coffee K-cups work fine.  If there had been free shipping it would have been better, but I will order again and look for a way to not pay 1/2 the price of the product just for shipping."
I'm sorry I bought this brand. It leaves a lousy after taste in your mouth.No wonder Amazon is giving .99cent shipping on this item. STAY AWAY!!! AVOID!!!!
This coffee is perfect for the morning. Not to strong but it gives you the perfect smooth jolt that we all crave in the AM..highly recommended.
"The quality of the popcorn is excellent, but beware, the popcorn IS HOT!  If you like hot popcorn, its a good product to purchase."
"I ordered Emerils Big Easy Bold a few weeks ago, and at least half the time I have been dissatisfied, because there is something wrong with the pods.  The pods do not work well in the Keurig.  Instead of dripping down into the cup, they collect the water, flooding the dispenser and delivering only half a cup.  At first, I thought it was our Keurig, but the other coffee we have, the tea, and the hot chocolate work fine.  It's only Emerils that doesn't perform the way it should. It was ordered new from Amazon, but other Keurig products from Amazon are fine."
It is very strong and pure! you just need a little bit to get a great flavor. Helps with digestion but the smell is strong!!
"Baby's getting to that solid food stage, so we tried the Dr. Sears recommended HappyBellies line.  Our girl likes their stuff--she's more partial to the rice cereal--and we like that it's organic and (fairly) unadulterated.  Addition of DHA and probiotics a plus.  If you can, try to find a sample portion or individual can for your child before committing to a large, 6-canister purchase, like this one.  Btw, it's tasty enough that Mommy and Papa don't mind getting this cereal in their mouths when cajoling their stubborn baby to eat."
"SINCE I HAVE TWO BABIES ON THIS FORMULA, IT WAS A VERY CONVENIENT WAY TO ORDER IT. BUT OUT OF EVERY TWELVE PACK I ORDERED, AT LEAST TWO CANS WERE DENTED ENOUGH SO I DIDN'T DARE USE THEM.  IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE WHEN YOU WERE GETTING TEN FOR THE PRICE OF TWELVE."
"I first tasted Sassafras tea in a local restaurant and really liked it.  So I started looking in grocery stores and online for it in a teabag form.  After several weeks of investigation I called the restaurant and asked what they used to make the tea.  I was told is was Pappy's Sassafras Concentrate.  I looked online and found it at Amazon.com.  As I was ordering it I also saw the Sassafras Teabags.  I thought I'd order a box to try.  I was very dissapointed.  It didn't taste like the flat rootbeer I was expecting.  It was more like black licorice, which I hate, with a very mild rootbeer undertone.  It also didn't have the distinctive red color that you get by steeping the sassafras root.<br /><br />I've never had real Sassafras tea made with the root so I don't know if the teabags are more like the real thing or not.  Bottom line:  I won't buy the teabags again."
"If you want an organic energy shot, your choices are this one from Steaz and the assorted flavors from Guayaki. Guayaki Yerba Mate is actually in the Steaz energy shot and energy drinks, and they both use Sambazon Acai, so there are some similarities in ingredients.<br /><br />Great energy burst for 4+ hours on a Steaz Energy Shot, and no withdrawals or headaches afterwards. Plan on drinking one every day at lunch at work. This will help me cut down on my iced coffees, which are not helping my calorie intake.<br /><br />Already ordering 12-packs on subscribe and save, 2 per month. Great value."
"I gave this product a one because zero wasn't an option.  This is like a can of generic tomato soup with some overcooked bits of fish scraps in it.  The only lobster in the soup was some shell.  It was salty, fishy, nasty and inedible.  Not only that, but 11 of the 12 cans were dented.  A complete waste of money.  Beyond disappointing.  It made me angry."
See's makes delicious chocolates; close to the best; but their chipping charges make each purchase a total rip off. I think that every one should boycott See's for that reason.
I bought this item as a gift.  It was something I thought would be different than the usual gift basket.  I really liked it and so did the person I bought it for.
I FOUND BUGS IN THE PACKETTE! IF YOU DONT LIKE BUGS YOU MIGHT NOT WANT THIS ITEM.
"I love the strong coffee flavor of this for baking, and have been using it for nearly 20 years in my chocolate chip cookies and other recipes.<br /><br />It's also tasty to drink, For a portable mix, I'll use instant dry milk, this coffee, a bit of unsweetened cocoa and a bit of sweetener. Then just add boiling water and stir well to make a drinkable instant latte. It's not bitter or burnt tasting like some instant coffees can be.<br /><br />While it doesn't taste as good as a pulled shot of espresso, it's one of the best instant coffees I've ever tried. It's ability to mix well into baked goods ensure it's spot in my pantry."
"I am so happy to try and enjoy pop-chips. They were recommended on calorie count.com, products like this are not available at local grocers. Caloriecount.com mentioned the snacks were available from Amazon.com which we all know is easy to order and accept delivery to your door. The pop chips are delicious, they come in many flavors. I have ordered them twice and shared them with friends. We love the single serving 100 calorie packs. The treats are tasty and delicious. I am on an email list to alert me when the jalepemo flavored pop chips become available. Thanks Amazon! I am planning to order them again for snacks on a family vacation. The variety will make this a fun treat and when compared to other 100 calorie treats this product gets a 10/10 rating from our family."
"I bought this sauce with very high expectations for heat. I was disappointed. I know something is wrong, this is supposed to be very very spicy, but when I tried it... it wasn't too bad at all. I got a bad batch or something. The taste is pretty bad, it's really earthy... dirt flavor. But I wasn't expecting good taste, just heat, which didn't deliver very well. I kept this at a high rating because it's really spicy, but I just got a bad batch."
"My 7 mo old despises all things fruit-related (we think it's too sweet for her) yet she likes this one just fine!  I'm perplexed that so many other reviewers say their baby hates it, although I must admit I haven't tasted it myself.  For us it's a tasty way to get her to eat a little more fruit every day."
"I have always used one brand of avocado oil for years, until recently.  I took the chance to try La Tourangelle Avocado Oil and what a suprise, the delicate flavor and freshness was evident immediately.  I have since passed on the information to my friends, we are all hooked on using La Tourangelle Avocado Oil. Thanks for a great product."
I like this coffee because it's intense since i don't mix anything with my coffee i like good quality of coffee to enjoy purely it's aroma.. I like the fact that the machine makes a little foam and it raises it's texture a little bit to my favor. i simply love it!
This product is wonderful.  Drizzle it on your pizza.  Mediocre to magnificent in mere moments!
"I discovered these when I moved to Canada a few years back.  Before this I had only experienced a thicker Wasa crispbread and was a bit put off at first.  The feelings dissolved the first time I ate one of these with light laughing cow cheese.  They are a little more ""powdery"" than I'd like, but they compliment most cheeses very well without overwhelming them."
"These are little airy and delicious nuggets of goodness...except of course, they aren't nuggets, lol. Really though, these chips are nice and crunchy while also being light and airy. The salt and vinegar flavor is just right...not too strong, but never lacking. Actually, my only real complaint is that i find it difficult to stop eating them. However, that is simply my cross to bear.<br /><br />Enjoy!"
"For serious goat cheese lovers, this is a step up from the French goat cheese that you can buy at the grocery store. I had never had smoked goat cheese before and this was a revelation: the creamy, smooth, a little sour taste went fabulously well with the smoke flavor. I used it sprinkled over a tomato, bean and romaine salad and also spread on toast points topped with an apple-zucchini relish from the 101 cookbooks blog. Outstanding artisan cheese that I look forward to enjoying again."
The 80 count pack is incorrectly advertised as costing .01 per count...That would make the package cost 80 cents...not close to 50 dollars
"Arm & Hammer's baking soda is aluminum free, they just don't write it on their packaging.<br /><br />I wasn't sure so I called them and they said there is no aluminum in it, and they would have to state it if there was because people take the product internally.  This leads me to believe that there just isn't aluminum in baking soda.  And researching it showed me that there might have been in the past, but not anymore and not for a long time.<br /><br />I resent that Bob's Red Mill writes ""Aluminum Free"" on their package and then charges a premium for their product.  It's also arsenic free, I hope.  If they label it ""Arsenic Free"" will we assume other brands aren't?  I don't like that kind of marketing."
"Great coffee it remindes me of the coffee i had in New Orleans when i was stationed there in the navy, You had to go to Jackson square to get some good coffee after church."
It was a real pain to throw out the whole bag.....but it was too disgusting to open.... beware. I am a huge fan of Kirkland products-but this was not worth opening to try.  My local Costco doesn't sell this.
"First of all, these things taste pretty bad. If you can handle the taste while they melt on your tongue, maybe it wouldn't be AS bad. But I really didn't notice much change in the taste of foods. Lemons tasted sweet, but that's all I noticed. I considered trying two at a time, but they just tasted so bad to me that I have never used them again."
"So far, of all the decaf Kcups we have tried, this is our favorite.  Wish it were on the automatic ordering system.  Coffee is such an individual like or dislike but when we use it with an 8oz cup of water it is great."
That's what they taste like to me. I gave them to a friend of mine who agreed they taste like French Toast. Great high-protein snack!!
"The key points here are probably the vacuum packing (no air!) and the extremely fine grind.  The fine grind results in a stronger cup off coffee with fewer grounds, meaning the bag lasts longer than a regular bag of coarsely ground beans.  I really can't say aenough about how finely ground it is: it's almost like a powder!  The vaccuum packing also means it's just a bit more fresh when you first open the bag.  Overall - no complaints at all: great tasting, strong-as-you-want-it coffee here."
"I decided to use this flavor to test the Krups/Nescafe's ""iced"" option -- room temp water pressure as opposed to hot -- because every once in a while I like a decaf iced coffee, which means buying an iced decaf Americano (I know this isn't decaf) in most shops.<br /><br />This is the Krups/Nescafe ""equivalent"" (I use that term loosely) to an Americano if you use a larger volume of water than for the Lungo.<br /><br />In short, I could barely swallow this stuff.  Cold-pressed, it tastes like end-of-the-day convenience store coffee that has been watered down.  Absolutely terrible.<br /><br />Trying it hot only yields marginally better results.<br /><br />The only reason it got 2 stars from me is because I'm impressed with the Krups process.  However, I still cannot fathom why a great manufacturer, Krups, chose to partner up on this project with an instant coffee company (Nescafe).  This flavor is the worst so far BY far."
wE LOVED THIS POPCORN  BUT COME ON  SHIPPING IS WAY OVER THE TOP  WE WOULD SETTLE NEXT TIME FOR SOMETHING WE CAN BUY BUT NOT SPEND 3 TIMES ON SHIPPING
good quality product. cheaper and easier to get from amazon than local pet store. switched from merrick because dogs had terrible gas. this has a great ingredient list.
"I find that even with the gain on maximum, the volume is not very loud.  I use it with a Shure SM57 mic and my Macbook (using Audacity).  One must be very close to the mike and speak somewhat loudly.  When I use the Shure mics with a mixer (the ""analog"" way), there are no volume problems.<br /><br />It is simple to set up, being almost ""plug and play"".  You have to choose the input source."
"We threw this garbage straight in to the trash. As far as our dog was concerned, he would rather eat sticks right of the tree branches than these crummy things."
A dream for those on Weight Watchers who love potato chips. The individual serving bags of Pop Chips are only 3 points and taste delicious.
"Upon the recommendation of my MD, I ordered this and started sprinkling my breakfast and dinner with it to increase my dietary intake of iodine and assist in treatment of my hypothyroid condition. (I'm on Armour Thyroid as well.) My thyroid levels seem to be doing better as of the most recent blood test. I don't think these flakes have much flavor, so I usually add sea salt in addition to the kelp flakes. But I do think the flakes help increase bio-available iodine in the body."
"I have a bit of a sweet tooth. I've tried to ignore it in times past, but the reality is that I want--NEED--a cookie from time-to-time as a welcome addition to my brown bag lunch. These 1.4 ounce single servings make that easy without overdoing it. If I bring one with me I know I'll only end up eating one package and not HALF of a 12 ounce package! Single servings help keep the portion size healthy while not killing your soul by ignoring your need for some desert...<br /><br />Reasonably priced and shipped to your door, these are a great purchase."
"Shake N Bake is the favorite staple of those in a hurry.  The fact of the matter is, many of their breading are fantastic and flavorful.  The Shake N Bake Pork Pouch is no different.  this is not what I would call a ""crispy"" breading, more like a ""crunchy"" breading.  It has tasty seasoning and really makes the entire preparation process much simpler.  If you haven't tried it in the past, take a chance, you will not be disappointed!"
"This is an excellent tea for a breakfast tea or for the afternoon or evening. It has a wonderful mellow flavor. In the morning, I like to brew it with Earl Grey to create a nice smooth blend. It is a great way to start the day."
"This product was absolutely horrible!  Each and every bar was obviously old, because it was stale, smelled awful, and had to be thrown out.  Shame one you for even trying to sell such a product!"
"i used to buy these at sam's club, they don't carry them anymore, now i have to buy them online, need i say more."
"If you're looking for a k-cup tea that tastes like tea with a twist of lemon, this isn't for you. This is more like a hot cup of lemon with a little tea in it. I can imagine it could be overwhelming for some people, but I like it. Lemon is the star and it is good hot or poured over ice. I wish they'd make a lime zinger k-cup as well."
"What was Quaker thinking?!?!  Why change something that has been so good.  I had to send them an email about it.  I did nto realize there was something different about the box, but I could tell when I ate it.  Something just wasnt right.  It made me examine the box only to find that the oatmeal isnt enriched with the vitamins it had and has less sugar.  Whatever they did - the new one is horrible and I am not searching for store brands to replaced my beloved breakfast."
"My German Shepherd took less than 1 minute to take off each cover and that included the time to eat the treat. I was looking for more of a challenge for him. Guess he is one of the too smart for his own good, or at least too smart for this toy. The one star is for my dog, it might work well for others."
"These are Phenomenal!  They taste as close to a full fat chip as possible, I was so surprised. Thank you so much pop-chips!"
"I got this a few months ago with high hopes but it was barely OK, kind of grainy, did not dissolve in milk."
"These are my favorite, but they aren't for everybody. In a way, they sort of taste like Oriental flavor ramen, but with a kick. For me, how can one go wrong with the combination of jalapeno and ginger? They are a bit rich, so they aren't for EveryDayForAMonth snacking. Because this is a case purchase, I recommend trying out a single bag before buying an entire case. The 2oz size seems to be no longer available, which is a shame; I can eat the entire 5oz bag."
"Can't find this product anywhere except on-line. I guess no-one enjoys them as we do. Same kind of hicks that don't like boiled peanuts I guess. Anyway, product is wonderful and was shipped promptly. Hope to continue buying from this seller."
"I expected any canned stuffed grape leaves to be oily & they are [6 oz oil, 4 lbs stuffed grape leaves].  What I  DID  NOT  expect was for the cans to come from China.  Like most other Americans I get many things that are made in China, but I draw the line at food.  Their safety standards are low at best."
It's all natural real food that you can see the difference. My cat loves it so much that now we call him the tiki kitty.
We use and buy sea salt instead of regular salt like sea salt came as promised in good condition have nothing else to say
"I have fed my 2 cats these treats the last 2 days.  Within 5 minutes of eating them, they are both throwing up.  I will be going back to the Three Dog Bakery Treats.  Expensive but have never made my cats sick.  Why is the company not responding to so many bad reviews?"
"Not too sweet, this very natural-flavored drink received an immediate ""Wow!"" from this taster, as it did with both my wife and 5-yr. old. (This latter can often deliver the death blow to food or beverage items adults deem worthy, so respect for this product was a definite plus!) Very refreshing, it seemed more like a professionally prepared light smoothie rather than a canned beverage. I wanted more!"
"This is an excallent product. The previous problem of the dented cans has been addressed, and was apparently not their fault. Highly recommended!"
Dissolved an entire tab on my tongue and was disappointed to discover that it had no effect on ANY of the foods that I tried.
"I ordered this prouct along with 2 others. I bought all together to get the ""FREE SHIPPING over $30"". What really happened is that each item shipped from a different location and I was charged seperate shipping for each. The shipping was such that I could buy these products more cheaply at the corner drug store. I feel I was misled into overbuying and was left feeling ripped off by Amazon. This is the experience I shared with my friends. After this purchase I bought books from Walmart on line for the first time."
I've recently started drinking green smoothies to get healthier and had read that agave nectar is much healthier for you than refined sugars and artificial sweeteners. I add a couple of tablespoons to my smoothies. Highly recommend to anyone wanting to get healthy an all natural way!
"it' an okay drink and didn't have a harsh or oddly synthetic taste to it as some ""juice"" drinks have, yet it wasn't anything super.<br /><br />This is a nice alternative to regular soda, but I don't see myself buying it that often. The high carbonation makes it less healthy than it is touted and is bad for your stomach. Too bad they didn't make it less carbonated or perhaps a non-carbonated version."
"This product was recommened to us from a friend.  After doing some research I found out that it was one of the best ceral's out there and recommended by Dr. Sears.  After buying some at a local store and trying it my baby LOVVVED it!  I could not fee him fast enough! The pre & probiotics really help him not get ""backed"" up.  I also save so much with the subscribe and save.  Thanks amazon and thank you happy bellies!!"
"Pamela's products can't be beat. I've tried other gluten-free products and none have been as good.<br />Not only the brownies, but all of the products from this company have<br />proven to be flavorful."
Whole family likes these.  Tasty but not over sweet.  Much more healthy for you than most bars.  Excellentprice through Amazon on the repeating order subscription.
"Thought I was getting a really good buy on these until I read the label. The dosage amount of Glucosamine/Chondroitin is vague. It appears I need to give my dog an entire bag to get him 500 mg of glucosamine. Too expensive for me. The dogs love them, so if you want to give them an expensive treat they'll love, go for it. If you are trying to get a preventative dose of glucosamine in a treat look elsewhere."
Very disappointing. It initially seemed like a good and healthier alternative to rawhide. I am extremely unhappy that this item is made in China!  I NEVER give my pets anything made in China.  There is much information out there about pets becoming ill and dying from products made in China.
"I enjoyed this product.  They are a good value for the amount you get.  I did not sense much honey in the product, so a bit more flavor would be nice.  I would buy again."
I am so happy with my purchase!  I couldn't find this product in my local grocery stores so<br />ordered from Amazon and received it quickly.
"Lowrey's Bacon Curls Pork Rinds: 1.75 ounce microwave bags are loaded with 350 milligrams of salt, Thats all I tasted, A pinch would have been better, or no salt at all."
"We have two St. Bernards, one of whom is close to ancient, and last year she developed a dental problem.  Someone mentioned GREENIES and off we went to find our old girl something to help her age gracefully and hopefully without pain.  Well, she just loved them - as did the younger Saint - and here we are a couple of thousand dollars later wondering how to wean at least the younger dog off these obviously addictive green hard gel bones that don't have a single expensive ingredient in them.  The packaging, however, is nicer than that of most department stores but just how many of those boxes do I really want?<br /><br />I have calculated that the most expensive dentist around here would have cost less than the dent Greenies have made in my pocketbook.  So this is a warning to first time browsers - move on to another product that might well do the job for a third of the money.  A stop at your local butcher's shop could be cost saving compared to these overpriced pieces of strange green.  Someone should tell these folks that we are inching toward a depression because to date their reaction to what must be declining sales is to just keep upping the price."
"This is definitely a ""Girl's Alcoholic Slushy.""  There are 6 different flavors, and you can use any wine you choose. The package directions are for an entire blender of slush. I have found that using a Tablespoon or two at a time makes just enough for one person.  Good stuff.  Have not found anyone who does not like this product."
"i have started the extraction process less than a month ago, and so far it looks and smell wonderful. waiting to try it.i have put 6 oz in 1.75 liters of vodka and now have a beautiful brown fluid that as i stated earlier smells wonderful. I plan on using the other 2 oz. in some homemade vanilla frozen icecream etc."
"I purchased these thinking they would just be ordinary oatmeal raisin cookies. Wrong! I like chocolate chip and I like oatmeal raisin but these combination cookies just don't work well together. I wish I had read the item listing more carefully. Even my kids said ""Blech!""."
"Let me preface this with a brief history of my tea addiction:  Until I was approximately 40ish I thought all tea came with ice and enough sugar to make it into the infamous ""brown kool-aid"".  Since I only drank tea at restaurants and my Mom's at obligatory dinners, no big deal.  Well as I slipped towards 50 I began to drink more coffee (which I liked) but which eventually led to a parting of ways due to the fact that the coffees I liked, did not return the favor and feeling slightly nauseous was not the desired effect I was looking to achieve.  One day a friend of mine suggested I try some quality tea (which meant nothing made by Tetley/Liptons/etc).  I tried <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000DBN2F"">Tazo Passion Tea, 24 Tea Bags</a> and while good it was missing that elusive element combination of good taste and adequate energy boost.  So I stumbled into this item <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4H5FY"">Twinings Variety Pack of Four Flavors, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> which gave me 4 choices (great idea).  So without any additional ramblings are my opinions:  English Breakfast Tea = 5 Star, this stuff is great  /  Irish Breakfast Tea = Again 5 Stars, maybe a infinitesimal edge over the English version / Earl Grey = 4 Stars, good taste and flavor, not as good as the breakfast teas (IMHO) but probably better for later in the evening  / Lady Grey = WTF??  This stuff was horrible, I tried to use 1 bag of it with 2 bags of the others to keep from pitching it into the trash but to no avail, I am gonna give it to someone who has no taste buds.  1 Star.<br /><br />Again, realize I am far from a connoisseur of fine tea but I know what I like and what I don't, I am going to buy a few boxes of the breakfast teas and enjoy them.  BTW I also bought a huge box of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000XEV9YE"">Taylors of Harrogate, Yorkshire Gold Tea, 160-Count Tea Bags</a> and to prove my tastes are obviously out of the norm I hated it (I wanted to love it but alas it has something added to it that sure ain't tea)"
These are great spices to use on all food types giving a great flavor.  The bottle sizes are twice the size of that found in a supermarket and about the same price.  So you get more of what you would normally pay for.
"Tried this for the first time this week and it is now my favorite coffee --with a hint of flavor (coconut). Full bodied, and no after taste, Jamaica Me Crazy is just what I love for an afternoon pick-me up, or to wake up and have an immediate smile on my face. Seriously -- It's Awesome! Highly Recommended."
"I don't much like sweet potatoes or things made with sweet potatoes, but these are really very good.  They have an unusual taste that is hard to describe.  It's a little on the sweet side; perhaps too sweet for some; great for others.  Popchips (any variety) are not quite as hard or crunchy as regular potato chips, but that seems like a plus to me.  They have a nicer consistency than potato chips.  I have tried other varieties of Popchips too and I like them all.  This one is of the more interesting flavors and it is sure to be a big hit.  Popchips are far less greasy than regular chips because they are not fried in fat.  Not sure of the exact process, but the result is a wonderful chip that I prefer to regular chips.  I wouldn't call these healthy, but certainly better to eat than regular greasy chips.<br />I would eat Popchips all the time over other chips, except that the bags are small and they are a bit more expensive than other chips.  The extra you pay for these is worth it if you like this style of chip.  I can't imagine anyone not liking Popchips, although perhaps not everyone would like this flavor.  Give it a try and you will most likely be hooked."
This used to be a hearty and great meal for my twin girls who have both loved it since they were 9 months old but they recently changed the recipe and it is watery and disgusting now. Very disappointed. And it seems that amazon does not allow you to complain directly to Happy Baby or return the product even though it has changed. seems unfair.
I have 2 chihuahua's and they are not at all interested in this toy.  I have tried different types of treats in it and they still care less.  Maybe it is a good toy for big dogs in a yard or something?
"Maybe, I got a bad one.  It's very plain, nothing special in flavor.  I felt like I wasted my time and money. I will not buy this flavor again."
"I'm a chomper.  When it comes to lollies, hard candies, chocolate, etc., I like to bite.  With these, I can simply let them melt in my mouth.  At just over an inch in diameter and less than an eighth of an inch thick, I have the patience to not chew these disks of chocolate heaven.  The salt on top is a luxury for your senses.  They must not put any in the chocolate itself, however, as there is only 50 mg. of sodium per serving (two servings per bag).  These chocolate rounds are an excellent way to indulge yourself."
"I have two golden retrievers who can chew their way through any treat in no time...not so anymore!  The Everlasting Treat Toy (one for each with both side holding a treat) have lasted the kids for going on a week now.  They love the taste, their teeth look great, and they continue to play with it right up until they get the last bit of treat out.  When the package says your dog will be busy for hours, they aren't lying.  I'm sold on this product and am busy stocking up on refills to keep my goldens happy."
"the taste isn't good, at least isn't good for Japanese and Chinese.<br />Its taste is basically sort of American Japanese taste.<br />Plus the price isn't competitive.<br /><br />I'd suggest Asians never buy it."
"The smell of this coffee was nasty. I thought maybe the taste will be a little better, WRONG! Honestly, do not waste your hard earned money on this one."
"They taste good and give you a lot for what you pay. The meat was of high quality. I was however expecting each tin to contain one medium sized fillet. Rather, these are about 6 small fillet in a can, much more like sardines are packaged (but these are just fillets). Was a bit disappointing for that, and the info could have been more clear."
"I dissolved an entire tab in my mouth and then ate bitter greens and it did nothing.  I added some vinegar to the greens and it did make it a tad sweeter, but it didnt make them taste good.....It makes really sour things slightly sweeter....but NO MIRACLE."
"I was trying to tell my 91 year old auntie who lives in the desert near 29 Palms about ""Bubble tea""  She just didn't get it.  One day we were shopping in the other desert near Palm Springs and I saw a stand up sign for ""bubble tea"" at the food court.  We walked the entire length of the shopping mall so I could buy her a bubble tea, and the STAND WAS CLOSED !!  When I saw that Amazon (my favorite place) had bubble tea kits, I ordered one of each.  I sent the kits to my sister in Desert Hot Springs so she could make and take the bubble tea to Aunt Ruth.  Thank you for allowing me to fulfill another item on her bucket list !!"
I use this in cooking and also as a skin care product. First time that I have tried olive oil as a moisturizer and I absolutely love it. This is one brand that I will buy again.It is great and gentle on the skin.
"One perfect box. No rips, tears or gouges. Inside the box? 6 badly dented cans of chowder that looked like they fell out of an airplane. Every single can! Very disappointed. Should I return them all? Is the chowder any good? Was this a joke? I rate this 1 star...for the unblemished box."
"Was hesitant at first to buy this coffee but I couldn't pass up the deal.  My husband and I drink med/bold coffee and are pretty snobbish when it comes to coffee.  I have had better coffee than Emeril's but it's up there in the ""good"" coffee category.  I would definitely buy again for the cost that it was."
"These things are great, I love them. I have not found a cheese snack in the US that compares."
We ordered the product...our dog loves them...but no one cares if its 100 degrees outside.  recieved in one big melted ball.  thought they would ship in dry ice.  If its summer or hot in your area dont order them !!
I got this drink expecting the carbonated taste combined with kiwi and berries. Well I could taste the berries but no kiwi. I did like the carbonation with real fruit juices without the added sugar but it is not low cal. I think that I liked this drink better than the tangerine drink but still is not for me. The drink is way too sweet for me to enjoy it.
"There is nothing too good or too bad about these chips. If you like plain potato chips, you'd like these. They are thicker than most brands, fresh out of box, very crunchy and not too salty (for me). One bag has a lot, I generally cannot finish it by myself. Part of the reason is that they are too oily (some chips almost look transparent, if you know what I mean). The taste of oil is a bit too overwhelming for me. If you are used to more spicy chips you may not like these since they do not have any spice, except salt, as the name says. I don't think I'll buy these again. The ""best by"" date on my bags are March 2011 and I ordered them at the end of October."
"WOW.  This popcorn is delicious.  We purchased a large 4oz popcorn machine for our game room family movie nights.  When it first arrived, I wanted to try it immediately.  So, I bought some Orville's at the store and I was disappointed with both the number of popped kernels and the taste.  After the Great Northern popcorn arrived, I was immediately hooked on the flavor and ease of use.  The packages are easy to use and the product tastes great.  Our family only uses about half of the salt flavoring and can not tell a difference in quality of the taste.  My son says it tastes better than at the movies.  Now when we go out to see a movie, we keep the popcorn bag and replicate the experience at home!"
"Yes, this is delicious vanilla chai...the best I've tasted. However, the product description says ""99% caffeine-free"" and this simply can't be true. I ordered the single-serving packets of this product and the package clearly states the caffeine amount. Each serving actually contains 65mg of caffeine per serving. That's almost as much caffeine as a tall Starbucks espresso-based drink. Almost twice the amount of caffeine in a can of Coke!<br /><br />If you need the caffeine boost, enjoy! But if you're watching your caffeine intake for whatever reason, be aware!"
"Vanilla flavor is barely noticeable.  Acidic taste, not at all what I expected.  Breakfast in Bed and Hawaiian Hazelnut are much better choices."
Condiments add such vibrancy and depth to dishes and this mustard can stand alone!.  I had read about this mustard on a food blog written by a former Chez Panisse chef.  I knew I had to try it.  I'm hooked!  It is a sublime addition to vinaigrette but when spread on rye bread with a few slices of ham ......love at first bite!
"We ordered the Earth's best 2nd dinner variety pack along with the fruit variety pack.  We got the fruit variety pack and an oatmeal and fruit variety pack, not the dinner pack.  Found out we can't return the item, either.  We will try the Amazon phone help, but if all else fails maybe my little one will like this stuff..."
"This coffee is phenomenal for the taste and value. I'm on subscribe and save and this is my daily brew, I typically go though 2 lbs a month or so. This coffee has an excellent flavor and is not bitter or spicy, beats Starbucks breakfast blend hands down."
Product was well packed and shipped on time. I put the squid ink in the refrigerator to store. When I went to use it I saw that it expired on 11-11 That two months prior to my purchase date. I was not happy. Especially since I visit and shop at the store when I in Miami.
"Okay, I'm eating these nuts as I write this review...<br /><br />And as another review noted, these are pretty addictive... However, I caution you in advance... after a few hand-fulls of these, you will be running around your house trying to find something to drink to put that fire out in your mouth.  If you like some heat and are a peanut fan... you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Would write more... but... I... need... a... drink!!!  FIRE IN MY MOUTH.<br /><br />HOLY HOT NUTS!!!"
this coffee has a very funny taste to it not good you would think wolfgang it would be good dont buy this coffee this is a review of 6 people there are 6 people in my shop we all hate it not good
The popcorn tastes great and these kits are easy to use in our kettle popcorn maker!  The kids love making their own popcorn!
"I love popcorn especially theater flavor, purchase 2 boxes, one tasted exactly as a theater flavor the other ox do not know if it was old popcorn or ?? did not taste as theater popcorn, no salt flavor :( happy with one box, unhappy with 2nd box. Unable to tell if I would purchase this product again."
Ordered this a few months ago only to find it is just basically lactic acid.  Read the ingredients.  The main label says olive juice by no such thing.  I am going to suggest that Amazon take this off the website.
"Great treat for all doggies, very healthy and they adore them.  Excellent and fast shipping,will buy again."
"Ordered directly from PetFoodDirect before I saw the negative reviews here.  So after delivery, I decided I would make the transition slowly.  A week and a half later, I was feeding approx half old and half new, and one of the dogs started vomiting/had diarrhea, had no appetite, and was lethargic.  I'm switching him to a plain chicken and rice diet, but if he doesn't get better soon, I'll have to take him to the vet.<br /><br />Other dog must have an iron constitution because she seems fine.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Took the sick dog to the vet.  He was given IV fluids because he became dehydrated.  $150 and one day later, he seems a little better.  But vet said the blood work came back a little off and I should bring him back for x-ray and recheck.  I'm going to hold off because I do think he's improving on the bland diet.<br /><br />The other dog had some alarming sounds coming from her stomach last night.  She seems fine today, but I think if the first dog had not become sick and if I had kept giving Canidae, I think this dog would have eventually become sick as well."
"Excellent Product!  Great taste!  Perfect portion!<br /><br />Only 100 calories in a bag.  I microwave it for 1:30 and it comes out perfect each time.<br /><br />Fills a medium tupperware bowl.<br /><br />And it was an very good value!  Only $8.98 for 3 boxes, shipped! ONLY 30 cents for each bag!"
This coffee does smell wonderful (mostly of raspberry and not so much the chocolate) but it tastes weak to me.  I usually prefer a donut shop taste (middle of the road for boldness) and was disappointed that this tasted a bit watered down.  I will not be purchasing it again.
"Ive been trying a few different brands and blends of k-cups recently and this one is by far my least favorite. To compare, i have just finished a caribou blend box, a newmans organic dark roast box, etc. I tend to like a medium strength coffee and i find the darker roasts work better for me-i tried the tullys black with sugar, and immediatly got this burnt cigarette aftertaste- long time coffee drinkers know this taste-ugh. I havent gotten this aftertaste with the other brands. I tried the tullys again, with milk and sugar, which is my usual preparation-i thought this might mask that flavor, but i can still taste it. I am dissatisfied with this brand, and i wont buy it again, too much wasted money with the boxes being 10 bucks each."
"I bought 2 bottles of this Tart Cherry Juice because they were cheaper than TART IS SMART. They may be providing the Anti Oxidents that they say but they completely failed me in helping to sleep better at night. I returned 1 bottle to Amazon & went back to TART IS SMART. I used to wake up 3-4 times a night & have trouble getting back to sleep. Being nearly 80 & retired, I can sleep in if I choose. With my TIS formula, I get to sleep fairly quick, wake up 7 hours later & get anothert hour or two after visiting the bathroom. This product may work much better for you but I found one that works for me & will stick with it forever. I hope to read YOUR opinion of this product soon?"
This is a great idea but just like baking a cake...you can't do it in a midrowave.
I really enjoyed this product.  It's very easy to mix and bake.  The taste and texture are very close to that of a wheat flour based bread.
I tried many teas and thought would try this kind. Saw it on Dr. OZ show. Didn't like its taste.
"When we got my dog, she barely ate. She didn't even like treats. We finally got her to eat, but the regular (more affordable) brands didn't sit well with her system. My vet recommended this or to cook her food on our own. Obviously, cooking food for a dog gets a bit time-consuming, but this Pinnacle food really was great for my dog. She finally started to gain weight. (She was so skinny when we got her from the shelter.)<br /><br />My dog doesn't seem to have the farting problem the other reviewer said.<br /><br />I guess every dog's system is different and you just have to find the one that's right for your dog. this one works great for ours :)"
"I have 2 Pomeranians that both ADORE this food! They never get tired of it. Both the canned and the dry dog food, particularly the Chicken and Rice, are excellent. You can see the pieces of rice, and it doesn't smell offensive like some of the other canned dog foods. I notice their nails and coats are strong and healthy, too! This is the BEST dog food! And trust me, I've tried many... A++++ for Canidae! The only drawback is shipping cost... If anyone knows where they offer free shipping, please let me know :) THANKS!"
"Both of my dogs have torn their ACL's in their life, with that came the process of PT and a diet change. We started to give these once a day to the girls, and they couldn't LOVE it more. which makes me LOVE it because they take these easily and are getting great vitamins in the process. I wish I knew about these sooner, I would absolutely  give them to all future dogs I have as well. I was so sad when my local stores stopped selling them, and now solely get them through amazon. The service is so quick and easy. Overall I couldn't say enough great things about this product!"
"I was never an eggnog fan until I tried this in a gourmet shop. Loved it. Sent my aunt who loves eggnog some and she loved it and requested more. The shop that I found it at sells out all the time. Obviously good stuff!  I never had problems opening container or with it not dissolving well,"
"I got this in my Christmas stocking from my stepfather.  We're both foodies, and try to cook like chefs in our homes.  I love this product.  I use this one for scallions/green onions which until recently always went bad before I could use all of them.  Sometimes I threw out more than 5, most times 2 or 3, but I honestly cannot remember the last time I used every single one.  That is, until now.  Inside the savor pod, they grow and keep for weeks (easily more than 3).  I am planning on buying the set of mini savor pods so I can actually use them for fresh herbs - storing my herbs in the same container as my onions is not a good idea.  The only drawback with this product is that the clear plastic cover is a little tricky to remove as others have mentioned, but wrestling with it is OK with me so long as I can use all my product before it goes bad."
"This stuff is literally the reason I am overweight! It is so incredibly delicious I cannot even begin to describe it.<br /><br />Try it, you will not regret it!"
The laddoos turned bad in a few days after we received it. No other item inside our fridge turned bad.
"I have been using this protein powder for about a month. The first thing I noticed is that this brand mixes better than Optimum Nutrition egg protein, but still not like whey or even rice protein. The texture is not great by itself in my opinion- not awful but not great. I have been mixing Garden of Eating Super Seed with the powder before adding water and it mixes to a much better texture. I've also tried blending the two with ice to make a smoothy which turned out ok. For those of us who can't tolerate the whey or soy proteins, this particular brand is the best I've found."
"Although Revolution Tea's website says their Sweet Ginger Peach black tea is their most popular flavor, I feel like this and the Acai Berry Green are the best flavors in a really great line of tea.  As I've already reviewed on amazon, both of these flavors (as well as Revolution's Orange Chocolate Green tea) totally blow Lipton's Premium Tea Pyramids out of the water. The clear nylon tea bags that both brands use let you easily compare the quality difference -- whereas revolution uses long whole tea leaves, lipton uses little flakes and particles.  If you're willing to commit to 6 boxes of this tea you can buy it here on amazon for about half of what you'd pay on revolution tea's website!"
I've been enjoying this tea for several years.  It is refreshing and has the added bonus of reducing bloating.  I work in a public area and people comment on how great the tea smells. Highly recommended.
"I used these egg noodles to make cottage cheese n noodles.  It was a favorite of mine as child.  My grandmother used to make it for me all the time.  Since my gastric bypass, I am restricted in the amount of carbs I can have, so this fit the bill perfectly."
"these are the tastey way to get hemp proetein into your diet my family & I put them in Salads,cookies,breads . I ordered the pack of 3 to be sent every three months seems just about right for my family of 5."
"This is the best sandwich topping ever!  I grew up eating Branston Pickle on my cheddar cheese and ham sandwiches, so it holds lots of good memories for me.  It has a deliciously sweet and tangy taste - some say (e.g., my wife) it is an acquired one - and nice crunchiness from the pickled vegetables.  I cannot say enough good things about it!"
I'm a repeat customer for this product.  It is a quality syrup at a great price!
"Our family has liked every other flavored we have tried (BBQ is the best). We like sweet potatoes so we assumed would like these pop chips.  I was wrong, no one in the family likes the sweet potato pops chips.<br /><br />I highly recommend you go to a store that sells the sweet potato before deciding on purchasing a large quantity."
"I love the Nativa brand, however, they always seem to leave out very important details on their packaging.<br /><br />I heard so many praises about how much better the Chia seeds are than Flax seeds.<br /><br />Upon arrival I opted to use these in my salad as opposed to the flax seeds I've been using.<br /><br />The Chia seeds caused the most horrible and painful bloating I ever experienced. Granted, I did use the full serving size, but since then I lowered the amount and STILL with even just a quarter of a teaspoon or less I get the bloating.<br /><br />I have since switched back to the Flax seeds which didn't wreak havoc on my intestinal tract.<br /><br />I am hoping I can find some way to use these seeds in the future because I hate seeing anything go to waste.<br /><br />My advice if you are set on trying the Chia seeds is to start out with a very low amount!!! And stick with that low amount until your stomach builds up a tolerance for these seeds."
"I bought this with the Presto 04830 PowerPop Microwave Multi-Popper back in July and have been very, very pleased.  Almost no kernels left in the bottom and fluffy, large popcorn.  Getting ready to reorder so I thought I would pass it on.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005IBXK"">Presto 04830 PowerPop Microwave Multi-Popper</a>"
"I bought a case of 8 ounce packs of Great Northern Popcorn. The popcorn is great and the convenience of having pre-measured packs is very handy, it lowers the risks of contaminated product and guarantees freshness. However, something is wrong with the case I received. I just went through my remaining stock and threw away another 5 packs that were leaking oil. I then washed the oil mess off of what was left and tossed one more that wasn't sealed on the popcorn. This is after I tossed 7 away a month after buying the case. I had started organizing my pantry and noticed oil everywhere, the source being the corner of box of popcorn. Not a fun clean-up job. I had forgotten about it until today, when I had noticed oil all over again.<br /><br />The bottom edge of the packaging seems to weaken and develop points that ""crack"" open.<br /><br />So out of my case of 24, I've thrown away 12 and used 3, that's ridiculous in my opinion. It just might be cheaper to buy it elsewhere and avoid the waste."
"I have been drinking hibiscus tea off and on since 1984.  When I went to Germany in 1984, my mother told me that it is quite popular there for blood pressure issues, so every day while I was there I drank it.  When I came back to the US I found it and drank it for a number of years.<br /><br />About a year ago my husband's blood pressure became elevated because of health problems he is experieincing.  So, I went to the local co-op and got some hibiscus tea.  Ever since he started drinking it his blood pressure has been in the normal range -- well under 120/80."
"The shipping was very prompt and the packaging excellent.  All other items in this order were excellent.  These were lollipops shaped and ""painted"" like flamingos.  But you have to hold them up close to the eye to figure out what they are!  They'll be ""OK"" to set out on the candy buffet, but they won't be the eye-catching item we'd anticipated when we ordered."
"I got my dog the Paw Flapper because he's a Basset Hound mix and loves to use his nose. He's also pretty smart, so keeping him occupied can be difficult. Unfortunately, this is a super simple puzzle. The first time he played with it, it took him about ten minutes to find all the treats. The next time, it took five minutes. There really isn't anything that challenging about it. Opening the flaps takes my dog a second, and all he has to do is keep pushing his nose into the holes to rotate the top and find all the treats. He had fun, but then it's a toy full of treats, so that's a given.<br /><br />The puzzle does seem to be well made though, so it's not a bad product. It just isn't challenging enough. I'll be returning it and trying one of the other puzzles."
This taco seasoning was not good.  We used it once and threw the remainder away.<br />I was disappointed since the other seasonings were very good.
"Having recently turned Vegan, I had to buy my mandatory supply of tofu. This stuff is the bomb! I haven't done a lot of exotic things with it thus far, but I LOVE to use it as a salad dressing/potato topper. I crack open a brick, dump it into the blender, add a little vinegar, a little soy milk, onion power, dill weed, chives, tiny bit of celery seed & a generous dose of nutritional yeast. I blend all that up till it's smooth, and then store it in a GLAD container in the icebox. Stays fresh for about 4 days. I like to just dump this stuff all over my meal of baked potatoes & romaine lettuce.<br /><br />I can't wait to explore ALL the options with this stuff. Banana pudding may be next!"
"Tried one and it was horrible.  My son is 11 months old and have been eating cereals for a while (mix of Earth's Best and Gerber organic).  This is the first one that he doesn't like.  When I first opened the can, it smells like green apple candy.  However, the taste does not have any apple flavor, or even ""grain-flavor"" like the other cereals but a little weird/chemical tasting; not exactly sure how to describe it.<br /><br />Back to Gerber & EB for my son..."
"This shows an older box but from what I can tell the dates of these reviews and the fact they mention the lower sugar and horrible new taste I assume they are selling the 'Lower Sugar, Heartier Texture, and New Great Taste"" boxes. They changed it all. It is horrible. Please Quaker change it back! You already had a High Fiber MBS and another one that is 50% less sugar MBS and a Weight COntrol MBS----but you HAD to mess with the original?! I have ate this for almost 40 years. Not anymore. I have to go to store brands now. Please change it back. Oh and if you want to join the movement Hehe...go to FBook and join, 'Change quaker maple and brown sugar oatmeal back' or something like that. There are a few groups on Fbk. Also go to the discussion site on the official Quaker Oatmeal Fbook page---there you can add to the disgruntled unhappy customers that Quaker has upset. Many discussions there on this."
"This was my favorite candy as a child; thus, I remember it well. The present product isn't the same. The flavor is very artificial, in comparison to the rich vanilla taste that the original had. Today's manufacturer is likely using a lot of cheap, synthetic flavors, synthetic components, and a rapid manufacturing turnover process, all of which make it the end result inferior to the original.<br /><br />Those hoping for the real thing will have to continue hoping. New tasters will wonder what the [harsh artificial tasting] fuss is all about."
"If you like the taste of water with a hint of coffee, buy this. Otherwise stick with Starbucks VIA.<br />I use the instant coffee mid-way through my day at work. The Taster's Choice requires 3 packs to make a decent 16oz cup of coffee. The Starbucks VIA only needs 1. Spend the extra couple of dollars on the Starbucks if you want good instant coffee."
I purchased this bag of dog food and then broke it up into smaller containers for freezing. I then threw the bag out.<br /><br />Now some of the bags have been recalled. I do not have the lot numbers I need to determine if my bag is on the list.<br /><br />Please forward that information as soon as possible. Thank you.
"I don't know whether it was a fault in the packaging or if they were just past their prime, but they were rock hard and the flavor was not strong enough."
"Well, I hope this pumpkin will taste good when I make a pumpkin pie next week.  However, I don't think I would order from them again since 5 of the cans were really badly dented.  Not just a little ding here or there.  Bad dents to the point of being afraid to eat it. They had to be dented BEFORE they were packed because they were inside cans."
"Received this order promptly, but am very disappointed in it.  Over half of the k cups have exploded in our Keurig.  When this happens it makes a huge mess.  The machine has to be totally cleaned each time.  It appears that the seal at the top of the kcups is not properly attached.  The ones that do survive make excellent tasting coffee, but I will not reorder them online again.  Very disappointed, makes some of the best tasting coffee we have tried, but only got to drink a little of it."
"These truffles are not as great as they are made up to be. I thought for the price they would have a greater taste, but they didn't have much taste at all. They are not worth the price, but had to find out for myself. I will not be buying truffles again, and I'm not going to spend over $10 for a fresh one."
I purchased this product for my Yorkie puppy (MiMi)who was 3 months old. She was very fuzzy and I went through several types of food for her from very expensive to cheap. This she loves and eats every last drop. She has also gained weight which we needed badly. Highly recommend.
"At my local Costco store, I bought Pace salsa numerous times. The salsa tastes feel rich and I love the jalepenos Pace puts in the salsa. Spicy, but not too the point where I'm sweating and can't enjoy my salsa and chips.<br /><br />The salsa doesn't feel watered down and this is a great ""go to"" salsa choice."
I reall love the chocolate raseberry kcups I was getting them through the  company but they are cheaper through amazon thhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039556K2/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_titleanks
"Making Mai Tai's like the Outback boys. Product was exactly what I was looking for. Thanks.<br />I have been looking for this ""missing ingredient"" for awhile."
The popcorn was great!! Everyone commented on how good it was and how it really tasted like movie theatre popcorn. I received it quickly and intact.
"If you want a really good snack bar try these, they are healthy and taste as good as any granola bar, but without the gluten!! I buy these regularly."
It didn't work for me.  Maybe its because I couldn't get past letting the whole tablet dissolve because to me the tablet tasted like vomit.
"I like a nice pork chop from time to time, and I like it breaded. Trouble is, the breading doesn't always stay put. By the time the chop goes into the oven, those crumbs are everywhere but on the meat. Shake N Bake solved that problem with its innovative shake before baking process, although you could use any breading as long as you shake rather than roll or dip the chops into the crumbs. But these are the folks who apparently invented the process, so one really should refrain from shaking and baking when using other brands of breading. Since a pork chop is pretty tasty with this particular mix, I recommend it. It made my chops nice and crispy, the way I like 'em."
"I love this breakfast cookie! I usually have this with fruit and tea or juice for a quick breakfast, or sometimes I have it with vanilla ice cream for dessert."
"This product has a strong after-taste of Crayola crayons!<br /><br />I am in the process of trying different brands of coconut oils for cooking purposes.  Upon opening the plastic container, the aroma of crayons immediately fills the room, and this flavor permeates the food that is cooked in it.<br /><br />I suspect the source of the problem is the plastic used in the plastic container as I have not experienced this with any of the other brands purchased.<br /><br />To date, my favorite coconut oil is distributed by Barleans.  The flavor is fantastic.  However, they do not supply a gallon-sized tub,and Dr. Mercola has the best product in that size category."
"Love Honey Stinger gels, but not these.  Too sweet.  The almond and cherry flavors are better than peanut butter, but I like saltier peanut flavors."
"I have fed the chicken and duck version of these--though now the reviews regarding china I find disturbing.<br /><br />Regardless, the beef liver version of these are not a hit with my pup and seem to be a very odd, plastic texture.<br /><br />The duck and chicken are both great--but I will be investigating the source of the food."
This is really good coffee for that morning take-off or the afternoon booster.  This features a nice mellow but rich roasted coffee that is hard to beat.  This is one of our favorites around the office and our family enjoys it at home as well.  Recommended.  RJB.
"These cookies are small, grainy and very crunchy with an awful aftertaste. And very expensive for such a small package of 16 cookies. Might be great for multiple allergies, But I was very disappointed."
This product gave me a horrible rash.  It contains both soybean oil and fragrance which are allergens.  They need to list allergens.
"I thought this was a great deal in the warehouse deals section, but it was pretty nasty and smelled like dog food when I opened each bag.  Slim Jim is made of crap too but at least it tastes good."
When I taste most gluten free breads they leave me with a blah taste except this one.<br />Its excellent taste and texture let's my daughter enjoy bread with the family and makes great pizza too!
"I love sour food but this one I can't bear.  Too strong sour taste... and even when you open the bag, the sour smell is too strong.  I don't like it."
"My 9 year old absolutely loves it!  Of course she is a fancy Nancy fan and whenever I sit down to have my Latte, she feels all grown up to have her fancy hot chocolate with her Mommy.  Love the taste and aromatic coconut scent.  I think its great she loves it and its different, she loves it and that is the most important thing she feels she now has her own special drink like Mommy when we cozy up to hot drink.  I have to find some more as she is upset she has ran out and we were lucky to find this one at Home Goods, now have to see where I can order some."
"We first saw this product in Costco but being Costco was 25 miles away we ordered through Amazon, received the chestnuts the following day,  I eat a package a week.  Love the texture and taste."
"I had this candy shipped to San Diego for my mother who has been very ill. It is her favorite candy. It was packed very well, did not melt and was very fresh. Each piece was wrapped very nice no mess. I ordered an even larger box of this the last time I sent it to her. My second order was 120 count."
Buying Jelly Belly this way is roughly $1.50 cheaper by the pound.  The local candy store in the mall does sell it by the pound... and you can pick only the flavors you want.  BUT it is more expensive.  And it seems like every time I pass the store the price has gone up.
I wasn't disappointed!  Crisp and clear grape soda!!  Loved this drink and will definitely order it when I run out.
"I am a big fan of chocolate and cinnamon, and was looking for a stronger cinnamon flavor than Stephen's Gourmet Chocolate Cinnamon (which is very good, but very subtle).<br /><br />This one has way too strong of a generic spice flavor for me.  It almost tastes like someone brewed really strong chai, then tossed in a little bit of chocolate for flavor.  The spice mix overpowers the chocolate, both in smell and taste, and I can hardly taste the cinnamon part at all, which is mostly why I bought it.<br /><br />Also, I drank the first 1/3 of a cup, then stopped and cleared the dishes later.  When I dumped it out, there was over an inch of THICK goopy sediment.  I followed the directions when making it, so I don't *think* I used too much mix, but you might try using less than the instructions call for.<br /><br />I'm going to try it again at some point, using less mix and keeping it stirred in between sips, to see if that helps.  But otherwise I have 3 more canisters to try and give away - if you haven't tried it, buy as small of a pack as you can for a taste test first."
"Product was delivered on time and free of charge.  The seeds, however, did not germinate.  I tried them in different soil placing them in a different location and they still did not germinate.  I would not purchase seeds from this supplier again."
This coffee suits my taste just right. I do not like a heavy or acidic tasting coffee but this one is mild with plenty of favor and I can drink it anytime of the day.
Great maple syrup for the maple syrup lovers. Had it on Christmas breakfast and it was terrific. Dark syrup with a little bit of vanilla flavor. Full flavor for a syrup.
All of the items listed on the description were not included in the box.  I was missing at least 4 food items.
"We like the regular Little Bear cheese puffs so we tried the crunchy too. Excellent! Very satisfying crunch, yummy natural cheese taste, and nothing to feel bad about healthwise (unlike those awful fluorescent cheese-colored snacks popular in the grocery store!). This brand is excellent, we highly recommend all Little Bear foods!"
"We switched to Canidae ALS after the tainted food scare.  We were very happy with our choice and I recommended this food to many people.  Then they changed the formula.  They made this major change without so much as a sticker slapped on the bag notifying their customers.  The change sent my dog into a tail spin.  Severe vomiting, diarrhea, hot spots and itching were the main symptoms.  And since she had always done so well in Canidae, I never dreamed it was the food.  After weeks of worry and meds and messes to clean plus prednisone for the scary hot spot (my vet shrieked when she saw it!) I started researching and a food change was the only thing that stopped the problems.  She lost 5 lbs. in a very short amount of time.  Canidae's customer service rep. blamed me for not transitioning properly!  Talk about adding insult to injury!  Not a good food for us and not a good company to deal with.  Wish I could give ZERO stars."
"I loved wintergreen Altoids!  In fact I loved them so much I stocked up last year at Easter when they were on sale for half price.  I had enough to last until this week.  So I bought a couple of tins at my local grocery.  Today I opened one and found out 1) they are now blueish in color and 2) the taste is terrible!  What prompted Wrigley or whomever to change these?  I can't describe the taste except that it is too strong and has a bitter aftertaste - nothing like the Altoids I used to love (and I had a few left today so I could compare side-by-side).  If you love Wintergreen Altoids and haven't had the blue ones yet, don't buy them.  You will be very very disappointed.  I'm going to return the unopened tin and see if the grocery will take the opened one back too."
I love to put a bag of Pumpkin Crunch on the table at work and watch people's faces light up when they taste them.  Try it.
"I tried this brand first and I must admit I became spoiled because subsequently I went to Whole Foods to try and buy a bunch more. I had to get Navitas and found they were smaller, drier and less flavorful. So here I am -- this brand's golden berries are large, with a wonderful more succulent texture. The only problem is sometimes I get the seeds stuck in my teeth! They have tiny white seeds like raspberries but the berry itself resembles a large golden raisin. The flavor is very strong and captivating -- like a lemon with the tartness strength of a cranberry. Within days of incorporating golden berries into my diet I have noticed my insides are thanking me. Golden berries are naturally very anti-inflammatory. They have an addicting flavor that I will gladly continue to feed into."
"After taking a tab, I was able to eat a hot pepper, but it didn't really taste sweet or good at all, just not very hot.  Then I tried some cayenne pepper, which remained hot with no alteration in taste.This is a nice idea, but didn't work for me."
"Whether you need to eat Gluten-free or not, these are great brownies.  Moist and full of flavor.  We took some to my kindergartner's graduation and the dissapeared quickly."
"My dog has to take medication every day.  I use the pill pockets to get some of the medications down, and he absolutely loves them.  He just thinks he's getting another yummy treat!  I highly recommend them."
"I used this mix to make a 9x13 cake in a glass pan using grapeseed oil, spring water, and free range eggs.  I thought the cake had a nice flavor to it but it was not what I was expecting.  I was craving a white cake (like wedding cake) and went to my local store to find something wheat-free, gluten-free and dairy-free; I purchased this vanilla cake mix.  I think it is a very good mix.  I couldn't really taste the vanilla flavor but thought it had a nice flavor.  The cake is yellow, dense (but not like a pound cake) and texture-y like brown rice has more texture than white rice.  I thought the sweetness was just right.  I think I would purchase again but would make pineapple upside down cake with it."
"This product is a real bargain, considering the fact that dogs love liver. I've used this as an addition to another dog treat product I use for my dog. My dog goes nuts when he knows that he's about to be rewarded with<br />Pro-Treat Beef Liver treats. The instructions advise to give 2-3 pieces per day when using. At this rate, the container will last you a good while. The product itself is very fresh and the pieces are all of various sizes and thickness. Average size of treat is small rectangular pieces of different thickness. They're easy to break into smaller pieces if necessary. My Springer Spaniel pup is 5 months old and he just loves these. I tried this product on my girlfriend's 10 yr old teacup Poodle, who is pretty slow at this point in her life. She absolutely came to life and jumped all over the place for a taste of one of these treats. Buy it....your dog will love it!"
"I was afraid to try this flavor but I was surprised, they are pretty good.  I put these in my healthy vending machines and they sell.<br />[...]."
"All of my cans were dented.  Some cans had multiple dents.<br />If we were told that and / or if they were discounted, I could<br />make the choice; however, this was just a case of a manufacturer<br />making extra money on dented cans and taking advantage of the customers.<br /><br />GDn"
I am very disappointed with this product because I could not see how many calories it has at the time I ordered it. I received it and now I can see it has 60 calories per tablespoon. Granulated sugar has only 45 calories per tablespoon. How could Agave Nectar be better than sugar?
"I eat this all the time, it is SO good. Even though it says cheese, it is actually dairy free, but the taste is just superb!"
"My husband is an avid coffee drinker.  Our son presented him with  a Kuerig Brewer for his birthday.  That was two years ago.  Since that time he has been experimenting with various ""flavors"" of the K-Cups.  This Nantucket Blend has become another ""favorite"" of his.  Thanks for making it so easy to order and receive from Amazon.."
"Delicious and aromatic. 4/5 stars because of Illi's superiority. It is however like 3 times cheaper.<br />If you are not ready to pay a fortune for Illi's coffee, this one is #2 but at significantly cheaper price."
They refuse to ship this fine tea to Canada.  I have to go to the Middle East to find it and bring it back.
"I have to admit, I was a sucker for the large quantity, 12 oz, when shopping for hot sauces ...but now seeing the size of the bottle, it reminds of wing-sauce bottle sizes.  Plastic bottle.  It does have a convenient squirt top.  But overall, not very hot or tasty, and made mostly from jalape&ntilde;os.  If I had seen the ingredients list I would not have bought it:<br />Jalapenos<br />Water<br />Vinegar<br />Brown Sugar<br />Lime Juice<br />Fish Sauce<br />Cilantro<br />Habanero<br />Garlic<br />Spice Blend<br />Salt<br />Potassium Sorbate<br />Xanthan Gum"
"First, I have to confess-I LIKE coffee! However, there are times it simply doesn't like me. That's why I was excited to try the Puroast Low-Acid Coffee-French Roast. Finally, maybe I would find a less-acid-y coffee that tasted like coffee without the side effects. Unfortunately, this one wasnt it. When I set it to brew, I was waiting for that pungent aroma of coffee to waft through the kitchen. I waited. I waited. Finally, a small hint of coffee aroma. OK, so if I couldn't have coffee aroma, I'd settle for coffee flavor. Unfortunately, I was again disappointed. If this were put to the blindfold taste-test, one would be hard-pressed to identify it as coffee. It had an odd, almost chemical taste that wasn't exactly pleasant. I thought it might 'grow' on me-and even forced myself to drink a second cup. It didn't grow on me, sorry to say, although I didn't feel any acid after-effects like I often do with regular coffee. Puroast upheld the low-acid portion of the bargain admirably . . I just wish they'd have upheld the coffee part as well. I wont be buying this as a coffee substitute; I'll either deal with the acid-and have both the taste and smell of coffee-or do without."
The taste is not horrible but it is not very good. There is not a very good mango flavor. I would not buy again.
"I just love skittles! For a while we had them here in Brazil (South America), but then for some reason I couldn't find them anymore, so when my aunt is coming down for a visit I ask her to bring me some. This time I decided to spare her the shopping trouble and I bought it through Amazon and had it sent to her place. The bag was a bit larger than I expected, but I guess this was a good thing, right?"
My husband and I tried this coffee in place of our favorite Dunkin Donuts one day and we had to throw out the pot. It was too bitter to drink! We definitely do not recommend this coffee.
"The normal 15oz can is too much SPAM for one person.  The 7oz version is perfect for me to make two sandwiches.  I cut the block in half.  Each half I cut into 4 slices.  The 4 slices are perfect to lay on top of a toast.  With some salad green and 2nd toast, it becomes a quick and filling lunch sandwich when I hike or backpack (need sodium to replace electrolyte).  The 2nd half will become my 2nd sandwich if I do overnight backpacking (for dinner)."
"It appears that the coffee is not very consistent with the flavor. My first experience with this coffee was a good one, smooth rich flavor. This box is so bitter that neither myself or my wife will drink it.<br /><br />I tried the coffee again this morning, just bad, very bitter. I normally like most coffees, this one is exceptionally bad. I must have received a bad batch, it seems that the batches are very inconsistent. I tried to send my coffee back to Amazon, no return policy fo coffee."
"If you are on the paleo/caveman/primal/hunter-gatherer diet, YOU WILL ADORE THESE COOKIES!<br />otherwise stay away, your taste buds aren't attuned to the uniquely sweet NATURAL cookies. End of story Paleo PURCHASE, SAD (standard American diet) skip it"
"I enjoy these chips. I got these instead of my usual jalapeno ones from the same company for a bit of flavor change. I think those are better but only slightly, like the jalapenos there is a great amount of flavor without being too overpowering. The small bag size prevents you from overeating as with a larger bag."
"The pumpkin I ordered came well wrapped, fresh and was delivered on time.  A few of the cans were bent/dropped/mashed, but overall the condition of the package was good."
"I just got a Keurig a few weeks ago and wanted to get some hot chocolate for it as an alternative to coffee.  I didn't have super high expectations, but these are absolutely awful.  There is a very strong plastic/chemical taste to these k-cups.  I tried all of them and tried putting some milk in them to help mask the chemical taste and nothing will help.  The only reason I gave these k-cups 2 stars is because my boyfriend can ""tolerate"" them, but I don't trust him because he'll eat just about anything.  In his opinion they are ""not that good"" but he will still drink the mug.<br /><br />From what I've read of other hot chocolate k-cups, you'd be better off just buying a regular mix and doing it that way!"
"If you're looking for an economical good tasting coffee for your espresso machine or pot, this is the product for you.  I have tried both Bustelo and Lavazza coffee, and the Supreme Bustelo is the best tasting, smoothest, richest variety by far.  The price is very reasonable too."
"Tasty and simple, everyone loves a bite, so make an ugly one you can justify trying out"
"With no clear instructions on how to open and close the unit, the first few times are an act of frustration.  When I finally realized that if I grip with my thumb and forefinger over the clear plastic shield, about one third from it's bottom and squeeze the sides, the bottom lip pops out nicely.<br />I will agree that this size is too small for most popular herbs like parsley, basil ect.  The company does now make a larger unit and it looks like it is more user friendly.<br />All in all I like it, I took away one star for the lack of instructions.<br /><br />3/2012: After a few months I have thrown this thing away.  It became increasingly harder to open and the size was just too small for the herbs I use most.  I have seen some newer, larger units that don't have the issue with opening it like this one has...I'm going to order one of these.<br /><br />I no longer recommend this unit and have lowered it to 2 stars."
I don't know if I got a bad batch or what.  About 1/4 of the bag doesn't pop and the flavor is absolutely horrible.  The smell of the unopened bags is putrid like it is very old and rotted.  I bought 2 boxes to give as Christmas gifts and am extremely disappointed with my purchase.
"When PopChips were really hard to find, I was ordering them by the case from Amazon on a regular basis.  The price was always great and these really are my go-to snack.  They are always fresh and delicious from Amazon.<br /><br />I definitely prefer Original over barbecue and sour cream & onion.  I haven't tried other flavors, but Original works just fine for me because I use it for various dips and will even use dry seasonings on them if I'm in the mood.<br /><br />I don't know anybody that I've offered some of these to who didn't want a bag of their own!  Highly recommended."
I opened the carton and the plant looked like someone put it in a shoe box and shook it all up.  I didn't think it would live.<br />It did recover however and a heat generating pad was included so I give it 4/5 stars.  knocked one for loose packing.<br />I would buy from this company again in hopes they get better at packing.
"I'm a fan of all-natural anything, especially when it's a tasty and healthy alternative to something I've enjoyed my whole life, but I know is 'bad' for me.<br /><br />Regular soda is one of those 'bad' things.  Loaded with artificial colors, sweeteners, corn syrup...yuck.  Hardly seems worth the risk when I'm also getting 150 empty calories on average.<br /><br />And now Switch has come along.  True to its claim, there's nothing artificial in it.  Just juice, sparkling water and other 'all natural' ingredients.<br /><br />That's great.<br /><br />So I chose this particular flavor (orange tangerine) because I wanted the strong citrus taste I love.  This drink, however, failed to meet their promise.  Yes, I can 'taste' the orangy citrus, but as much I can taste the apple and grape juices used as well.<br /><br />Moreover, this doesn't have that bold 'pop' to it as other carbonated beverages have.  I've had mineral water with more bite.<br /><br />But the worse part about this 'good for me' drink is in clocks in at 140 calories (the same as a regular can of Coke) and 36gcarb/34g sugar (compared with Coke at 39/39).<br /><br />On the up side, it has less than half the sodium as many regular colas and does deliver 100% Vit C and 20% Vit A. But if I wanted those kind of health benefits, I'd rather take them directly from the source: an orange.<br /><br />Overall, the all-natural health pros of Switch Orange Tangerine, simply don't justify the high calorie and carb count.  The Switch Beverage Co. may have done better to sell sparkling water with a twist of orange peel if they wanted to provide a truly healthy alternative to traditional sodas."
"Excellent quality pet food with no inert ingredients, filler or potentially unhealthy meat by-products. I used to have to travel several zip codes away to buy it, and it was well worth the trip to give them food I was confident was of the highest quality. My cats can't get enough of it and the price is very competitive, especially if you are a Prime member.<br /><br />Still in doubt? Try this test:<br /><br />Open a can of your current cat food and smell it.. then compare that to any flavor of Merrick. It won't turn your stomach.<br /><br />When it says fish, there are huge chunks of -you guessed it- fish. Not a weird extruded-looking grey or stinky brown paste that you could mistake for what comes out the other end, but actual food in a can. Speaking of which, the post meal 'litter box stink' period is dramatically reduced as well, as is fecal volume. Less to clean :)<br /><br />Give it a try.. remember to mix it with your old food for a day to two to ease the transition, but your cats will thank you for it."
"I was looking forward to tasting the Switch Orange Tangerine drink since orange and tangerine flavors are two of my favorite but I was disappointed in the result.<br /><br />It was tangy. It tasted of ascorbic acid. It smelled of orange candy. It reminded me of breakfast. It reminded me of, yes, powdered Tang mixed with carbonated water followed by a strong unpleasant artificial aftertaste.  I found the the drink to be, simply, not very good.<br /><br />I tried to like the beverage and I did appreciate the concept but considering the unusual flavors, high calorie count of 140 cals/8.5 oz, and cost of almost a dollar/serving -- I cannot recommend Switch."
Love this oil. Use for everything from cooking to cosmetic use. Makes a great (out of the sun) moisturizer for my face and a wonderful hair treatment oil. But I just found a website that sells in larger quantities for a better price. Example: They charge $24.15 for a gallon and $11.65 for shipping. That's less that $40.00. Where here you pay for more. Don't know if I can put up the site.....but it is located in Tucson AZ and search for avocado oil bio genesis. Please let them know if you are buying for cooking or cosmetic use. I buy cooking and use for both.
"I have a pitbull mix who is just a year old.  She was a stray I found at our school.  She chews everything (leather shoes, her bother's ears...) and she is inqusitive so I began a search for the perfect toy for her.  We have tried toys that are for aggressive chewers, many only last a day!  If she can't get it started one of her brothers help her out.  She is smart and needs to think as she chews.  We came across the Tug-a-Jug and decided to give it a try.  She took to it right away.  It has holes in the bottom so the smell of the treats continue to hold her interest.  The screw-on lid has fine threads so she can not unscrew it.  The rope cord is frayed on the inside to hold in the treats for longer play time.  The unit is made from strong plastic and is too big around for her to use her powerful jaws to crack it.  The rubber ball end is a good place for her to hold as she carries it around the house. Once I fill this toy with food I know she will be ingrossed for at least an hour while she works on getting all the treats.  A couple of things to keep in mind, the treats add to the dogs calorie intake so you have to cut down on meal time, and it can be a weapon if your dog likes to throw it around (I know this from experience!).  The first one I got for her, the cord was much more frayed on the inside so it took longer for her to get all the food. The reason why I had to purchase another Tug-a-Jug is she finally chewed through the rope."
"Strong positives:<br /><br />Here is my assessment on buying 3 cases of this product as a cook:<br />1. This is a very strong value on an organic product<br />- Nearly 60% to my local Whole Foods<br /><br />2. Organic products don't act or cook like the mass produced brand but the difference is in the organic nature of these items.<br />- Our experience cooking for over 50 people and over 12 pies so far is they all tasted fine and didn't see any issues in consistency.<br /><br />3. Dented cans, 36 cans purchased and no dents.<br /><br />4. Lastly, beyond the value it was organic with a shelf life on our cans into late 2013.  So while I'm sure the cans we have left will be gone by then the reality was this was a great deal at better than 60% off to my local organic store.<br /><br />Great product and value, glad it was an offered program wish there were more organic items on amazon.com."
"A pretzel is a pretzel right?  Wrong.  I was amazed at how these really taste better than any I have had before.  I think these are the best tasting pretzel rods you can get in a supermarket or here on amazon.<br /><br />The malt really makes a difference in the flavor.<br /><br />The diameter is perfect for dipping in mustard or eating plain, not too thin and not too thick.<br /><br />They have an even and sufficient coating of salt.<br /><br />They arrived undamaged and very fresh with high crunch factor, not at all stale.<br /><br />Mine were not burned like others have experienced with their orders.<br /><br />I have 12 bags and am happy to keep a supply in the pantry to put out for guests when they drop by; it makes it very easy to serve good food at a good price by buying in bulk on amazon."
When I lived in Germany I bought this all the time over there. The biggest problem was of course everything was written in German. Since you have a computer just go to a translation website and scan in the instructions and have them changed to English. From there you can use the product.
"Ginger Peach Tea has the most amazing peach smell.  Who does not love peach?  It feels so luxurious to smell and sip a sun-ripened peach.  Even though I'm down South, I enjoy it warm or hot all year long.  (Thank the Lord for air conditioning!)  The warmth enhances the odor and thus the flavor.  It's also good cold.  It has become my favorite tea.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FQJT3Q"">Kindle 3G, Free 3G + Wi-Fi, 3G Works Globally, Graphite, 6"" Display with New E Ink Pearl Technology</a>)<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0040GJJ02"">DecalGirl Kindle Skin (Fits 6"" Display, Latest Generation Kindle) Tahiti (Matte Finish)</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA0PIQ"">The Twilight Saga Collection</a>"
"I buy Newmans Own adult dog food for my two chihuahuas.  I've always fed them natural, human-grade dog food, even though most brands can be a bit pricey.  Like most pet parents, I try to do the best I can for my dogs which starts with feeding them right.  Most dog food can be disgusting and the practices behind it are disturbing.  Newmans Own is more affordable, and I feel good about the company's ethics and practices so it was worth a try.<br /><br />My dogs love it so it was easy to switch from the other brand.  They gobble it up! I now have it on subscription so we don't run out."
"Even with small containers, they don't fill them up.  These little tins are less than half filled and at the price charged it seems a rip-off. Is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares?  Or how about the cereal ploy, they were filled at the factory but settled in transport.<br />Can manufacturers be honest in their dealings?"
"Great value, love the large size 19.5 oz plastic container, love my pepper mills and use lots of whole peppercorns. This large size saves time buy not having to replenish my peppercorn supply so frequently. With the Holiday's fast approaching an ample supply of whole peppercorns is a must have kitchen item. The peppercorns have a fresh bright taste without being overpowering and are great in any season."
"I purchased the Honey Stung Smokies and some of the reviews stated that they were mushy, I wouldn't go that far, but they are softer then most beef sticks but they still have a 'snap' to them. The taste is great, even the picky kids liked these smokies-I think we will try some of the other flavors. plus order these again."
"It was pretty good the customer service was just bad, 3 of the 5 packs were broken and i got cut by the broken glass sent with it *nothing major* took 3 weeks and 130 cellphone minutes for them to tell me i will get free shipping on my next order. I tried the mix after that because they wouldint refund me anything and i am not allergic to chocolate but after drinking this product maybe 5 minutes after i started vomiting horridly. I let a friend try the other pack*he is also not allergic* He broke out so bad and started swellewing we had to bring him to the hospital. After 15 minutes on hold (at first the lady forgot to hit hold apparently they were very confused) i spoke with a manager and the only thing they could say was a simple sorry and they would send me another half off. I figured hey maybe it was just bad luck so i ordered another and this time instead of broken packets it was missing 3 packets and both spoons. I am really never ordering from this company again."
"Look no futher. Always fresh! Nothing is worse than stale candy,, so save yourself from anguish and purchase here today"
"6-Hour Power's ingredients are pretty much the same as its rival, 5-Hour Energy's, so obviously the effect is pretty much the same. Yet, this cost me $18 for 12 while the other cost me $8 for 2 at the nearest store.<br /><br />Great savings even if you only need these just a couple times a week.<br /><br />The taste isn't as tangy and addictive as 5-Hour Energy's berry flavor. A bit bland in comparison, but it's still nowhere close to bad."
These are just as good as the Weight Watcher chips and easier to get.  Great flavor and only 3 points.  I will be buying more when I run out
"Got the package here in Afghanistan.  Cans were all damaged, but the packaging was intact? Hmmm.  The cans that were not damaged went Ok.  Lost 5 in all."
"A delicious strong black tea with enough flavor to stand up to milk and sugar. Might take some getting used to if you don't usually drink black tea, but for the aficionado it's one of the best."
"I have a tendency to avoid products with artificial sweeteners, and this includes sodas with high fructose corn syrup.  The Switch is a line of fruit juice sodas with no added sweeteners--not even cane sugar.  It has carbonated water, fruit juice, some natural flavors and colors, and vitamin C.  If you're going to drink soda, carbonated fruit juice is the best way to go.<br /><br />The Switch has several flavors, including Orange Tangerine.  However, it's clear some flavors are better than others.  The Orange Tangerine has a harsh aftertaste that another flavor I tried does not.  I've tried other citrus juice sodas and enjoyed them, but something went wrong in the flavoring of this particular soda.  If you're looking for an orangey soda, try Izze's Sparking Clementine instead."
After trying a sample with my new Keurig it was by far my favorite tea.I looked for it at a lot of stores and couldn't find it..... ta da !............ Amazon.com to the rescue !...........
"This is my 7 year old son's absolute favorite soup that he takes to school almost every day.  Despite my attempts to broaden his taste buds he continues to insist that he wants this ""red"" soup every day with crackers.  My husband and I have also tried it and it is quite delicious.  Like all Amy's products you can feel good about giving your child this soup.  The ingredients are all organic and tasty.  I have offered my son Campbell's soups in a pinch when I have run out of the Amy's Alphabet soup but he really doesn't care for them.  If you read the label on Campbell's soup you will realize that they are loaded with junk.<br /><br />Amy's soups cost a bit more than traditional canned soup but I think the extra cost is justified in higher quality ingredients and delicious taste."
"I was tired of paying upwards of $12 for two beans at the local store, so I thought that I would give these a try.  i was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the beans.  I was expecting the usual dried out lackluster vanilla flavor I have ""enjoyed"" from the super market spice rack, but these beans are so much better.  I used to live near a natural food store that carried an excellent selection of fresh  spices, unfortunately with the recession they closed down.  These beans rival those that I could purchase there.  They have a robust vanilla flavor that came through very nicely in the ice cream I made.  I was used to doubling up on the beans in the recipe to get the vanilla flavor I wanted, but quickly found out that I didn't have to with these beans.  Highly recommended ! Enjoy!"
"Like the title says, I have tried (nearly) all the brands, spent a lot of money, and in the end these are the best Gluten Free Pancakes I've had.<br /><br />I am not happy about the lack of fiber, and the the starchy flours used. But a handful of ground flax seed makes up for that.<br /><br />I am also happy about a brand that helps you to make biscuits and other things from the same mix. Other companies sell biscuits and pizza dough as a separate item, duping the customer to spend even more money.<br /><br />Compared to the many other brands, these do not have a ""funny"" taste or smell from odd flours. These are made mostly from Rice and Potato flours. You just feel NORMAL.<br /><br />I hope they will come out with a ""whole grain"" version from Brown Rice and Bean flour.<br /><br />TIP: To get the fluffiest texture use BUTTER instead of oil. Room temperature butter."
"I have been using King Aarthur All-Purpose, Whole Wheat, White Whole Wheat as well as Bread Flours for several years ever since I discovered KA in a supermarket. Believe me it is well worth the extra pennies for a bag of these flours. I have used these flours mainly for bread (I could live on bread even though they say that man does not live by bread alone) as well as for cakes and cookies.  If you haven't tried KA I strongly advise you to start baking with it ASAP. I do not work for KA nor am I part of the company--just one of their loyal consumers."
"My dog has a very sensitive stomach and this is the only treat that agrees with her.  She gets one a day which I use to coax her onto her crate in the morning.  She saves the Greenie until I return home in the afternoon, like it's her treat for being such a good girl all day.  So funny!"
"I really like hazelnut flavored creamers, but I find them too sweet.  I use this extract to make my own sugar-free creamer (with fat free half and half) and it works well."
I was in a hurry and did not read the reviews...I trusted amazon's description and it did NOT indicate it was flavored coffee and that it was NOT Jamaican...it is very lightly flavored with vanilla so it isnt too bad. I feel cheated.
"I tried Simply 7 hummus chips at the NY winter wine festival 2 weeks ago and to say I was pleasantly surprised is an understatement. They are absolutely delicious!! It has the requisite crunch of a chip and no artificial colors, flavors, preservatives and is gluten free. Definitely will look for it in stores!"
the product was very good. why i gave it 1 star was the poor packaging and all the broken cookies.
Short on flavor and not as advertised. Says no sugar but doesn't admit to the sugar found in the concentrated juices. My teens felt it was just ok with the flavor. I did not like it at all. Is it better than drinking pop? Probably but does the high price warrant the small differences?
"We have used Purina Cat Food for our cats for decades with complete satisfaction. I'm truly amazed and puzzled by the bad results some of the other reviewers have been experiencing.<br /><br />We shifted to the indoor formula several months ago because we do not let our cat outside. We had been giving her the regular Cat Chow but she seemed disposed toward eating the living plants we had in the house so we hoped the indoor formula would help relieve this tendency on her part.<br /><br />Since we shifted over she has seemed to enjoy her food and has exhibited no adverse effects that we have observed; again I am really puzzled by the results some of the other reviewers have gotten. We still keep a little Cat Chow around and will give her some for variety's sake.<br /><br />To complete an earlier thought on eating plants, the indoor formula didn't seem to make a difference so we've moved the living plants outside.<br /><br />If anything changes I'll update this review and in the meantime I wish the best for the cats with the problems!"
If your not into healthy and into flax seed DO NOT buy these.  They are healthy and they taste like it!  I love them...they are very good.  My husband loved them too.  It's all a matter of taste.  If you're looking for a Dunkan Hines brownie these are not it.
"This is a great product that helps keep me from overindulging in expensive coffee house mochas!  It is easy to carry in pocket or purse, and makes ""plain"" coffee taste special.  I highly recommend this flavor along with others by Flavour Creations."
"Like most of the US, our local stores were all out of canned pumpkin and didn't expect any more to be available until after the Fall 2010 harvest.<br /><br />So, I turned to what I thought was a reliable online retailer - Amazon - to fill the gap.<br /><br />I read the other reviews, but not until AFTER I placed the order.  My mistake, I know.<br /><br />I was optimimistic that perhaps I'd be one of the lucky buyers who didn't get any serious dents.  Unfortunately, just like others reported the case came sealed in two boxes.  The inner box was well packed with bubble wrap covering the already sealed case of pumpkin cans.  The cans were dented even in the middle of the sealed case.  They had clearly been packaged this way and not damaged in shipment.  I find it appalling that Farmer's Market is using Amazon.com as a way to sell its dented and damaged product, knowing full well that buyers cannot visually inspect the product prior to purchase."
"Bought this under the influence of many positive reviews.  I'm sorry to say that I found this produce upalatable, unacceptable.  It manages to be both insipid and bitter, leaves a nasty aftertaste, and has none of the mouthfeel of peanut butter. I'm returning it right away."
"Expired and broke my daughters braces,<br />She should not have been eating it in the first place lol but they were as stale as a rock!!"
Our 2 Vizslas have done very well with this food since we switched from Foster Smith food last year.
Totally amazed at how far a small amount of this glitter can be spread. I bought 3 to decorate a wedding cake & used less than 1/2 of one! It was beautiful & worth the money.
"I bought these for pancakes, and I haven't used it to make any other recipes, so I cannot speak for how it makes biscuits, or any other item. But for pancakes, it's a no-go. They have a hint of pancake-flavor with lots of butter & syrup; but I don't like smoothering my pancakes in fattening syrup, so these pancakes are NOT for me. Moving on to other mixes..."
"Ghiradelli might not make the best chocolate in the world, but their chocolate mix is my personal favorite. It is rich and mixes easily without the residue in the bottom of the cup that lesser brands suffer from. The mocha flavor is very good with a strong coffee flavor that doesn't overpower the chocolate. This is simply great hot chocolate and well worth getting if you enjoy mocha. It also mixes very well in milk shakes!"
"These taste very good, but aren't like the BEST things ever either. In order of my preference (gross to good) with explanation: The ""rainforest"" flavor one is my least favorites (I don't recommend this particular flavor). has a weird cayenne pepper aftertaste to it (don't get me wrong, I love cayenne, but not in a cookie!).... The ""tropical"" one tastes as if corn bread was turned into a cookie version (not a bad taste. Really good, actually!)... the ""Original"" is very great. I forgot the taste though, but I remember liking it..... ""Alpine"", in my opinion, is the best - it tastes like a European type of christmas cookie. it has a chocolaty (carob) taste to it, but not overly-sweet."
came with an expiration date of 1 month!!!!<br />amazon need to not send out bad products or not sell them at all
"I tasted this last week and thought it was excellent. The fact it has fiber is goodness. That said, I'll be going with the peach flavor because it also packs a bit of protein."
My sweet little Persian looks like she is dying. She's been puking all night because of these treats. How has this item not been recalled?
"My husband just bought a Keurig coffe maker. In the box was samples, his favorite was Donut Shop. I ordered the 35 K-Cup for him. I was so disappointed, out of the 35 k-cups 11 were decaf, giving me 6 k-cups of each of the 4 flavors.<br />I also ordered the Wolfgang Puck sampler, I got 12 flavors 4 each. How cool is that!<br />I would order Donut Shop again, just not the sampler."
I did not realize when I decided to purchase these that they were boxed and because of that I found them stale and hard.  I had previously purchased these at a local store who packaged them in plastic and they were soft and fresh.  Sorry that I could not give these a better review.
"I strongly suspect this caviar, which is widely available in US supermarkets is a reason for fear of caviar in 90% of American population. This product only resembles real caviar in shape and color (artificial). It would not qualify for caviar in Europe. It's from the wrong fish, it has totally wrong taste, and it also has whole periodic table on the label. It's like dying chicken breast into red color, marinating it in steak souse, and selling it as New York Strip Steak...<br /><br />Real caviar doesn't come from lumpfish, and real caviar only have two ingredients - caviar and salt. Try Red Pearl Salmon Caviar if you want to try caviar. You can easily find it on Amazon and other places online."
"I absolutely love'em! I buy them by the case, for me and my children and my grandchildren. We use them for munching, cooking, baking. Im so glad not ti have to peel them, and they are every bit as delicious and nutritious as fresh roasted! Recently my granddaughter was in a crabby mood and couldn't stop crying. At my wits' end, I whipped out a bag of roasted chestnuts, and bingo, she stopped bawling, and stated getting them out of the bag, and popping them into her mouth! I have lots of recipes using them, just look on my site! [...]"
"Each of the different Wat-aah! varieties have themes. I picked up the Power theme at the Natural Foods Expo, and I asked the guy what made it different. He looked a bit stunned, but he pointed out the magnesium in it and then looked at me blankly. That's one of two things wrong with the company's marketing. Everything else is spot on--well, except that they're selling water, and they're selling it to parents who should be making their kids drink water whether they want to or not. But that would require parenting. I digress.<br /><br />The other thing wrong with this product is the label copy. I don't know what the other bottles say, but I'm guessing kids aren't buying this water, so the label copy SHOULD sell the parents rather than the kids, but I would think the parents would reject the water, based on the copy. The copy explains to kids that they should fight to drink this cool Wat-aah! Power instead of spinach, because of the magnesium, which is apparently the only value in spinach. I digress again. The label even says that spinach ""is green and sticks in your teeth"" in comparison to the water that ""comes in a cool bottle."" Right under all of this is a Fight Childhood Obesity logo. Right. So, I'm going to bring something into the house that argues against them eating spinach, AND that helps me fight childhood obesity how? Now, I'm not saying that spinach is the answer, but do I need a company marketing themselves as a substitute for something else that is good for kids? Moreover, how could they think that's a good idea, a selling point to adults with critical thinking skills?<br /><br />Well, apparently they do. This water is marketed based on its cool bottle. But it's just water and some of the usual ""special"" stuff that is often in water we buy. It's also marketed to give kids ""buying power"" with the cartoon front and the spinach argument. Frankly, I'd rather any kid of mine didn't rely on marketing to make a product choice, and oh, guess what: they are kids. They don't get to make the product choices.<br /><br />The company has somehow made the right connections, gotten the right endorsements, achieved school distribution, and is conducting a social media campaign that is textbook perfect. Too bad they're also selling water and the idea that marketing to kids (and marketing to them in a way that doesn't support eating leafy green vegetables) is a good thing. If it wasn't for the mixed message on the copy, maybe I could accept that it's marketing like sugary cereals do: to the kids. But this product just teaches kids that bottled water is good. It's not a horrible lesson, but parents should be teaching their kids through the parents' buying power--not the kids. When they get a job, they can buy spinach-replacing water. And eat their damn spinach."
"This tea smells good, but my entire family doesn't like the flavor.  It just doesn't seem to work and tastes terrible.  What a shame, since I really like the idea of this tea.  Just had to throw the box out!"
I decided to deter from my usual brand and try this.  I like a strong green tea but using the same measurement I usually use with this brand was so weak I might as well have just used the entire container.
"A year ago, I was in search of a natural sweetner to replace pancake syrup which contained ingredients I wanted to delete from my family's diet, so I tried Madhava Organic Agave Nectar. Oh boy did I hit home!It's all natural, from a plant I'd never heard of, (agave plant). It's delicious not only on pancakes, but in teas and just about anything that requires a sweetner! My wife bake some chicken wings yesterday and she coated the wings with the agave nectar, uuummmmm! Wish I could give you guys a bite, but sorry, ALL GONE! I Highly Recommend this product! I keep 4 of the 46 ounce light jars on hand at all times!...And no, you can't borrow some from me, GET YOUR OWN!"
"Finally, an affordable flavored coffee worth drinking.<br />Coffee Bean Direct Hazelnut is a really smooth, medium roast coffee with a definite hazelnut flavor.<br />The flavoring is not sweetened, which is a real plus, especially if you don't like sweeteners in your coffee. (If you do, you have complete control yourself.)<br />The flavor is not overpowering, but is enough to let you know you are drinking a hazelnut coffee.<br />Those who have complained may have received a bad batch. Usually the blend is good and roasting consistant, but, as with any other food product, variations and accidents do happen.<br />I have been using Coffee Bean Direct coffee for about five years and have not yet received a bad batch.<br />This one is a winner."
"I was rather dissapointed with this product. I've had Lavazza before and remember it being more flavorful. This was very mild. It may be because it was old stock. The ""Best If Used by"" date on the bag was 7 months ago. I won't order it again through Amazon for fear that somebody it just getting rid of their old stock through mail order. I'll find a more reputable store."
"I bought this seasoning because Amazon stopped selling the 12 count Konriko cajun seasoning so this was the one they had in a 12 count.  I bought it thinking it would be similar to the Konriko, BOY WAS I WRONG!!!<br /><br />First of all like another reviewer said some of the ingredients are as follows:  hydrolyzed soy protein, and Partially hydrogenated cottonseed and soy bean oil.  I was completely stumped as to why these two ingredients were necessary in a spice blend mix.  Now I know why with the hydrolyzed soy protein; as the other reviewer stated it's a industry way of adding MSG.  Well why in the world do we need that and what's up with the HYDROGENATED SOY BEAN AND COTTONSEED OIL!!!!  BESIDE IT BEING BAD FOR YOUR HEALTH IT CAUSES THE PRODUCT TO CAKE AND CLUMP.  I steer clear of products with hydrogenated oils in them.  An even though this may not have many trans fat an accumulation over time is what makes this deceptively bad for your health.  When I purchased this last year they did not have the ingredients listed in the description, now it is.  I think that AMAZON as a regular practice should require all food products/company's to list the ingredients of their product to sell on their site.  WHY WAIT UNTIL THE CUSTOMER PURCHASE IT TO FIND OUT???!!!  I don't think this is a customer friendly practice!!!!<br /><br />Not a good buy IMO.  I found my Konriko at another site and will be purchasing it from there; unless AMAZON brings it back at a 12 count offer; otherwise to buy one at $8 and $4.99 s/h is just way over priced and highway robbery!!!!"
best popcorn i have ever made. got to go order more so you do the same !!!
"I'm disturbed that these treats, as many reviewers state, are so ""addictive."" My dog, too, loves them but has now begun to shun her meals and will only eat these treats. In trying to make sense of her current state of anorexia, I recently became aware of the FDA advisory on Dec. 19, 2008 stating that one of the symptoms to be aware of in dogs eating chicken jerky treats made in China is ""decreased appetite, although some may continue to consume the treats to the exclusion of other foods."" So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats.  Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?  I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring.  Thankfully, her kidney function is still fine, but if you research this on the web, many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure.<br />See this link to the FDA website suggesting caution to consumers in using chicken jerky products from China.  Be informed!  [...]"
"I have purchased these in the past, but this order tasted a little stale. I have purchased food many times, but this was the first time that I have been disappointed in the quality. I should have returned it."
"My dog is relatively picky when it comes to treats, but she loves these. They don't do much to help her doggy breath, but maybe over time they will help."
We prefer the Swiss Miss brand K-cup.  This one was watery in both milk and dark chocolate. This is my least favorite of all k-cup brands.
"I saw where others thought this was a little on the sweet side. It is sweeter but still delicious and so incredibly refreshing.<br /><br />We live in Florida, and when I get overheated, this really cools me off even better than water :)"
"I decided to give these a try.  The lids are VERY difficult to put on and I often ended up bending the cup while trying to affix the lid.  They do not seal perfectly and I often found unexpected puddles, but they do the job.  Since I have a Keurig permanant filter I thought of just buying the paper filters to save on cleanup.  For almost $11 from this vendor, you can get 50 (fifty) paper filters.....I would just assume use paper towels.  That works out to be just under 25 cents for a small piece of paper....DisposaKups, please re-evaluate your pricing!"
"I bought a 5-bar box from Home Goods, of all things. I had never had one before. Vegetarian and Gluten Free and it tastes as good as some candy bars to me. Higher fat content than I'd like (Total Fat 14g, Sat. Fat 12g) but calories are only 246. I will definitely eat these often, just not everyday."
"So, I really really wanted to like this stuff, and I tried to make it all the way through one can, but alas I lacked the strength of will. I love ginger ale, and Jamaican ginger ale in particular, but this flavor (and maybe we had a bad batch?) was a whole new, disgusting animal that took me quite a lot of time to pin down my feelings on. Firstly, I felt I was drinking water that had been poured into a glass that used to have Pepto Bismol in it, but had not been rinsed out first. Secondly, I thought maybe it tasted more like truvia had been simply mixed with water into a sickening solution. Third, it made me think that i now know what it would be like to drink generic birch beer after someone else had thrown it up. And, lastly, when i finally gave up, as if giving up on a bet, it just tasted like hostility and sadness.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and try a different flavor!<br /><br />One caveat- Usually, when a company screws up any kind of ginger ale, it is because they seem to make it taste soapy. Kudos to Blue Sky for finding a whole new way to make ginger ale so vile. It doesn't taste soapy at all!"
"This is supposed to be a pretty basic and standard cup of coffee for the Krups machine, but was undrinkable.  I will take Green Mountain coffee over this any day.  Even my husband who is not picky with his coffee at all could not drink this.  He even tried putting creamer and sugar and could not disguise the taste."
"This is simply the best gluten free baking mix, and Amazon's amazing pricing makes it affordable.  A few very enthusiastic thumbs-up. (Free shipping, too!)"
"Thought this might be a nice alternative to use with my favorite coffee, but was sadly disappointed.  It leaked all over - no matter what we tried and the coffee was weak, machine clogged with most attempts and water wouldn't brew thru.  At times the cup even melted a little - leaving a nasty taste in the coffee.<br /><br />Go with the greener alternative and try the ekobrew - much better results and no waste."
"This jerky is quite pricey for a 6.5 ounce bag, but it's one of the few I've found that is salty enough and doesn't contain a bunch of sweeteners.<br /><br />The smoke flavor is also pronounced.  Unfortunately, the price is the only thing that keeps this product from getting 5 stars from me."
My 7 month old Rottweiler broke the bottom lid off within a few minutes.  The plastic is hard and when he tossed the product around by the rope it hit the ground and broke.  Now he just plays with the rope.
"This is such a great product from subtle flavors and aromas for delicate dishes to smokey salts for hearty cooking, this is a great product for the chef who loves flavor and experimenting in the kitchen.  This is such a cool product!!"
"So bad, I returned it. My children didn't even like it, and they are not difficult to please when it comes to sweet drinks or food."
Love this product and so do dogs! It is a big hit with all breeds and owners alike. Try it out!
"I was not expecting this coffee to actually be shipped from Jamaica, so I was pleasantly surprised to find a FedEx International package at my door.  One cannot argue that it didn't come from Jamaica! I assumed it would be shipped via a distributor in the US.  I guess that just proves what they say about assuming...<br /><br />The coffee is real smooth and enjoyable.  Unlike other ""Jamaica grown"" products I tried during my youth - this one you can proudly admit you really did inhale the sweet aroma!<br /><br />It comes packed in a burlap bag with the sealed coffee bag inside, just like the picture.  It arrived fresh.<br /><br />As with any of these boutique coffees, you pay a premium - like the Hawaiian Kona coffees - so it's really a matter of taste and the depth of your pocketbook if you think they are worth the price."
"Wee bits is a great size kibble for small dogs. However, soft stools were the results with my two little dogs. I added lactobacillus/acidophilus but it made no difference. I called the local distributor in our state, and his recommendation was adding yogurt or lactobacillus...some dog foods just don't work for certain dogs, and I don't think you should have to add supplements just so your dog can tolerate the diet. We have since switched to Innova EVO and have great results."
"I had already bought this product from another website before and I generally love it. However, the one I bought from this supplier tasted horrible and it also tasted like someone dropped ashes in it.  This comes with 12 packages and I opened 3 to make sure that it was not just a problem with the one package. Because this was so horrible, I could not bring myself to try the rest so the rest of it will be going into the garbage."
Greenies are the special treat we give our golden retriever and great pyrenee/golden retriever mix.  Greenies are hard enough that our dogs have to chew slowly but not so hard that I feel uncomfortable giving it to them.
I have told any number of people when I can't find something I immediately go to Amazon and voila there it is and most times at the best price also!  With this particular item had it in California where it was readily available here on East coast not at all.  Found it once and never again and since it was super market item asked for it to be ordered only to be told if it's not in the wharehouse we don't open 'new' orders.<br />Just on a lark checked here and here it is.  Ordered a case.<br />Love it best canned soup I ever tasted-why because it parallels the taste of the homemade cream of turkey soup my mom used to make.  What a find!
Coffee beans did not seem fresh.  No oil on them what so ever.  I have tasted much better and fresher.  Will not order again.
"Wolfgang Puck's ""Breakfast in Bed"" is a much more flavorful and robust medium roast than this one."
"Got these Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar (15 5oz bags) and was not impressed. Tasted kind of flat. I was eating some out of the bag, when I looked down into the bag and noticed a hole in the bag about the size of a sesame seed. Then I started looking at all the unopened bags and MANY of them had this type same hole. Some bags had multiple holes. One bag had a hole the size of a dime at the bottom of the bag like a rodent had got to it. The box they shipped in had NO holes so they we're packed this way. So much for quality control and who ever let these ship should be fired. Needless to say I'll never be eating anymore Kettle products and expect a full refund from Kettle or Amazon.<br />M. Martin"
"Well, I'll begin by saying that I was really looking forward to this product. I tried TruVia's erythritol/stevia sweetener when I ran out of the stevia sweetener that I used before and wanted to get something instead of plain sugar. I figured that I liked the mix and wanted to try this powder because I had already ordered stevia from amazon. When it got here I used it right away, and did not taste the difference. I was very conservative in adding this to my coffee because I didnt know how sweet it was. After adding 3 large spoonfuls into my coffee I gave up, and I usually add 1 spoonful of sugar to my cup. if you want a sugar free sweetener that you can even make at home, get stevia. I have used it from local health food stores and always ended up with that funny aftertaste from stevia. the one I ordered from amazon, sweetleaf vanilla creme didnt have that aftertaste, and I used 12 drops in my coffee looking for it, typically I only use 4 drops in my coffee."
"I'm such a coffee snob that I source from specific farmers in Ethiopia. I say this so that people will understand I don't drink grocery store coffee.<br /><br />This Puroast low acid stuff? Flavorless. No body. No ""coffee-ness"" to it. It tasted like vaguely coffee-flavored water. It's caffeinated, so it's got that going for it. I'd rather take 50 Tums and drink good coffee though."
We switched up from nutro chicken and rice to newmans own and chip's bowel movements are so much more dense and compact. our vet says its a sign of good food. nuff said.
"This is the worst Jerky I have ever tasted.  It is not edible, I actually gave it to my dog and he spit it out...I kid you not.  Don't buy this product unless you are a bar owner and want your customers to guzzle beers to put out the salty fire that is created when you eat a small bite of this crap!!!  I deserve a refund for buying this dog food....oh excuse me I forgot even my dog won't eat it :-)"
"These were nasty, they were so greasy and too rich for my blood, plus they lacked major flavor, no spicy jalapeno flavor at all.  I was so dissapointed in these chips, I am always hearing great things about these chips but I am telling you, yuck yuck yuck.  Give me pain chips any day.  Maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but I am staying clear from these chips. I wish I could give these zero stars if I could."
"Good flavor,texture,taste & price,my nephew enjoys them,when sharing  he uses this 72 pcs selection,The 84 pack is single wrapped."
"I've only bought one roll of these at the store. The first taste is OK, but there is a really weird aftertaste that I can only describe as tasting ""moldy""? Bought the wintergreen version as well and they definitely do NOT have the odd aftertaste."
"I think Depeche Mode said it the best ""I Just Can't Get Enough"" and that is how I feel about these crackers.  They have a WONDERFUL flavor and are low in fat and calories.  A serving size is 17 crackers.  These are a great alternative to basic potato chips, macaroni salad and/or french fries.  Great by themselves, with dip or along your favorite sandwich.  Once you open a package you will be amazed how long before you're opening another."
"This was my second maker, they last just about 15 months, so if what to invest your money, go ahead! The K-cups are expenses. you can wriye keurig and they don't even respone to you! OH they are great at first. You know you can buy a black and decker or something like that, for lest than fifty dollars and it will last about 2 years or better! Thesa keurig are well over hundred, that's the cheaper one, now to upgrade it like $150.00. Thats my opinion."
"I love these chips and couldn't contain my happiness when I recieved my box!! Love them, if you love spicy foods...get these!!"
I grew up eating these cookies.  Got a case for a great price.  Will be looking for them again this fall.
"This coffee has a nice flavor, not too bitter, just a nice round coffee taste. Rich flavor, naturally decaffeinated with water, and it's kosher. What's not to love?"
"If you have a dog that turns his or her nose up to all dry and wet foods from premium names such as Wellness CORE, Merrick, Blue Buffalo, Evo, Stella and Chewy's Freeze Dried Patties, Dr. Harvey's etc. then you have to give this a try. My dog is a 40lb Sheltie/Collie mix so having a large highly active dog that wouldn't eat was very stressful I hear many people with toy breeds having the problem but I never thought I would happen with a high energy dog. I was shocked that she hated all other dog food and would only eat a little if I wet the dry food and hand fed her she would really try and starve herself any other way and she was not holding out for human food because I do not give her any knowing the problem would of got worse, if that was possible. I found this food by searching online for food for picky eaters and this came up. I was not hopeful because a lot of the brands I previously tried had similar reviews of picky eaters liking it and my my dog not. When I read that it was jerky like pieces it sparked an interest because she loves those types of treats. The company sent me a Venison trial bag and I purchased the Lamb 2.2lb bag and she lovesssss it. She wakes me up now at 8am whimpering by the bag because she wants it soooo much. The smell and texture is incredible I never saw her eat so fast and she is so much more energetic and happy this food is amazing and not that expensive considering the smaller portion. I could not be more happy this product has everything I need."
"When the flowers showed up, they were in pretty bad shape.  I figured that water and the provided plant food would spruce them up within a few days.  Didn't happen.  They went from being dull and wilted to being dead within four days of arrival."
"I love the chocolate brownies that i've ordered from this company, but to me - the blondies seem wayyy undercooked.  I know people love brownies moist and chewy, but to me they seem doughy and almost like raw cookie dough.<br /><br />They have candies on them and caramel etc., and i feel they are a good product and company - it's just that i like my blondies cooked longer!  I am going to try to bake one in the oven, altho i know parts of it will melt."
"I got 1 pack of these from my local grocery store and tasted them for the first time. To me, they taste just like corn nuts. They are quite hard, so I wouldn't recommend to anyone who doesn't like hard foods. They are crispy and delicious snacks tho. Will buy more. :D"
"This is vile stuff. The ingredients list says the sweetener is inulin, derived from Jerusalem artichokes. Woof. No other sweetener is listed, but it tastes like three freshman chemistry majors came up with their versions of fake sugar and then dumped them all in."
"McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)<br /><br />I'm a fan of the McCann's steel-cut oats, so I thought I'd give the instant variety a try. I found it to be a hardy meal, not too sweet, and great for folks like me (post-bariatric surgery) who need food that is palatable, easily digestible, with fiber but won't make you bloat."
"The main reason I drink decaf is to have the pleasure of coffee to go with dessert in the evening.  My caffeinated coffee is drunk in the morning... only one cup.  So this coffee is pretty good with evening dessert since I won't get wound up.  Flavor is good, packaged well, easy to brew."
"I really liked these sea vegetables (I use them in home-made miso soup). The price is a bit high (I'd feel better with a $5-$7 reduction in the price), but the quality is great. I love the fact that these are 6 different species included, to provide different vitamins and minerals. Unfortunately though, the various species are not included in equal proportions, so some flavors overpower others."
"This coffee has a nice bold flavor, not too strong, but smooth and bold enough that you know your having a wakeful, full bodied cup of coffee that is really enjoyable.  If you like a distinctive, medium bold cup of coffee you will love this."
"""Boylan Bottleworks""<br /><br />AS a charter member of ""Free Associators Anonymous,"" the company name is ripe with conotation: Pittsburgh. Giant pipes of metal and glass with sweaty workers downing a ""Boylans"" (or, shorter, sweeter: ""Hey, Trow Me a 'Boys'!""  Ironworks, manholes made in Oakland, tough immigrants, and cherries blacker than coal. Coupled with The Bottle Americana, even a non-serious soda flavor like cherry has a certain gravitas, a don't-screw-with-me style, even though I'm rich enough to afford this.<br /><br />Speaking of serious, let's get on with the parlor game of tasting notes. Boylan's Black Cherry, as noted by others, isn't too sweet (cloying as the wine connosieurs will tell you), syrupy, and it tastes like cherries, especially upon entry and in a very satisfying aftertaste. However, a grape/apple flavor sneaks in under all this, so much so that I was surprised that Boylan uses cherry juice only.  It keeps Boylan's from perfection, just as the Amazon price may give you pause.  (Trader Joe's does it again--will this company ever do an IPO so that we can all get rich off its well-deserved popularity.<br /><br />Back to Boylan again.  It's strong enough to stand up to ice, the fizz is moderate--you don't lose half your cherries to foam--and it's quite tasty and refreshing. Again, the only minor problem I had was the perception of a grape juice filler, perhaps my imagination, or perhaps a characteristic of one of the varietals in Boyland's cherry blend. The competition is from other designer sodas (Kemper's, for example), and from cherry sodas made with the artificial flavors and colors that we all grew up to love. At this price, it's a treat, and the taste is so good it'll disappear quickly, but you're a working man or woman. You deserve this liquid luxury presented with no-nonsense attitude."
Bought this after reading the good reviews - not sure if it has to do only with my package but rice and lentil mix literally has a smell of mold. I actually opened two containers to make sure it wasn't just my nose playing tricks on me. I love this brand and I am very disappointed.
"It sounds delicious, but the taste is just too fruity, and not all that good tasting.  It just tastes weird, for lack of a better description.  I enjoyed Van Houtte French Vanilla and Creme Brulee flavors, but this one will be re-gifted:) I wish you could get smaller samplers without having to commit to this many."
A great idea that falls short. Bisquick gluten-free still uses an aluminum-based baking powder that is toxic to humans. Aluminum lodges in our bodies and has been found in quantities unacceptable in autistic individuals. The company refuses to respond to customer inquiries concerning this. I cannot give this to my family until the baking powder formula has been changed.
Just because you see 96 treats on the box your crazy if you think that's how many your buying everyone knows 96 really means 45
"What I like about wafers is the lightweight effect. Thought these would be similar to Manner wafers, with many exceedingly thin layers, however they are very different. The three wafers per piece are thick and crunchy rather than lightweight and paper-thin. In addition, the filling is scant and dry. The wafers lose their crispness very quickly when exposed to air, so must be eaten immediately upon opening. Given that these wafers have ingredients similar to those of the Manner competitor, they are overpriced and inferior in taste and texture. Other household members don't like them either, so I will have to give them away. Will not buy again."
"These are wonderful!  Exactly like the originals, only in miniature form.  Delicious and crispy and the wonderful Amaretto flavor!  Rapid shipping from the seller as well!"
I use the hazelnut flavor to make  my own coffee syrup.  It smells great and tastes great.  It's does a great job  of saving me money on the syrup I was purchasing at my favorite coffee shop.
"Kids that are not used to whole wheat pasta may not like this since the texture of whole wheat is chewier than white-enriched pasta. My boys have had the less healthy version of mac-n-cheese, and the whole wheat (we are big whole wheat eaters!) and they love Annie's whole wheat shells.  It's their absolute favorite."
Regular flavor Budda Bones are great for my dogs but they apparently do not care for the minty flavor on these.
"I've only given Greenies four stars because they're pretty costly at one Greenie per day (and we have two dogs).  That said, we stopped giving our dogs Greenies for a period of time and there was a significant amount of brown-colored build up around the base of our dogs' teeth.  We started giving them Greenies again and within a short period of time the build-up was gone in most areas and, overall, greatly reduced.  I realize that we could brush our dogs teeth in order to avoid the cost, but neither of us wants to take on this chore; plus, the dogs LOVE Greenies.<br /><br />I used to buy this product at Petsmart, but they're much less expensive on Amazon."
"Love this on a toasted bagel with cream cheese and scallions or even dill, great way to enjoy caviar and not break the bank."
"These took FOREVER to ship and when they did arrive they were not as durable as advertized.  Was looking for a bone to keep our dogs busy, these were more like a snack."
"Tying to find a tea that didn't have that bitter taste was difficult; and the cost of teas is not cheap anymore.  I was trying many of the healing teas, but they had stevia added to them and I could not get past the taste of that.  This tea is not bitter, and has a very nice smooth flavor.  I have had it both hot and cold.  I do feel that I am energized after drinking it, but it is not a jittery hyper feeling; it is more of an awake and alert feeling mentally and refreshed energized physical feeling.  Some reviewers state it has a sweet taste to it but I do not get that.  While I do not often add my 1/2 packet of sugar in the raw to it perhaps that is what they mean; that you do not have to add sugar to it.  I have replaced my second cup of coffee in the morning with this tea and I even have another cup throughout the day instead of coffee.  Excellent taste and an all around great product."
"I've only really used this for pancakes so far (less one attempt at making chicken fingers - it was ok).  The pancakes are really pretty good.  I've used this recipe:  1/2c. mix, 1 egg, 1/4 tspn. baking powder (keeps it light), 1 1/2 tspn Splenda and enough liquid to reach normal batter consistency (start with 1/4 c. and add more if needed - cream and a little water is ok, but unsweetened soy milk is excellent for this).  Cook in liberal amount of butter and you shouldn't be disappointed.  Makes one really big pancake or several smaller ones!"
"I ordered the 6 month ice cream of the month club for my wife's birthday.  She received her first shipment today and none of the 4 ice creams that were sent matched the sheet they included explaining the ice creams (you could have bought several of the ice creams, such as butter pecan or mint chocolate chip, in your local grocery store).  When I called the 800 number I was told that occasionally they reserve the right to change the ice cream if it doesn't ""meet their quality"" guidelines.  When I told her none of the four ice creams that we received matched the overview sheet from amazingclubs, the customer service rep was rude and told me that I needed to call back and talk to someone in their ""support group"" (note: you must call before 6:00 PM EST to speak to someone in this group). I would seriously caution you to shell out more than $300 for this club."
"I was so excited thinking they had my favorite discontinued Kettle flavor, but was disappointed when I opened the box and found this substitution. I am keeping them but would not have ordered 15 bags of this flavor. It is a very good bbq chip but I could get this flavor at the grocery store. Why oh why do my favorite food items always get discontinued??? The one star is for the substitution. The country bbq is a 4 start chip, but not the chip I longed for."
Don't bother getting these. You'll spend more time cleaning up the mess due to the poor packaging then you'll spend enjoying them.
I love Stephen's Gourmet Hot chocolate.  It arrived quickly and we have been enjoying it for at least a month now.
"I buy this every winter as a little treat to myself.  I like it with just hot water, but I recently started adding it to my coffee instead of creamer.  I love it!"
"My wife likes her coffee really weak and finding that in a K-cup has been a tough job. I like stronger coffees than the Breakfast Blend but I also enjoy this. It's still too strong for my wife but it's as close as I've been able to find to satisfy her taste (she adds water to every cup no matter which setting it's brewed on). I've been unable to find a ""lighter"" K-cup so we've been drinking this blend for years now. If anyone knows of a ""weaker"" K-cup coffee, let me know!"
"I prefer the two textured gummi's over the regular gummi's. Haribo's are among the best and the frogs are addictive. The current price, combined with the free shipping and no tax make these a nice buy. The only drawback of buying in bulk is that I tend to eat more of them. These are aslo a big favorite of my kids who would also give them 5 stars."
"when I first received these doggie treats I was a little concern since they appeared to be TOO hard. My pup is 16 years old and missing a couple of teeth.  I gave her one, and she chowed down on it...and gave me the look...the look that says...more please...LOL...I lay out some milk bones and one of these treats..and she goes for Newman's first every time I tried it.."
"Someone was saying these are all dented.  Not a single can of mine was.  And even if they were, who cares?  It's not like anyone is giving these as a gift, so all that is important is the contents.  The contents are fine.  I'm glad I found some!<br /><br />UPDATE ***<br /><br />We ordered a second batch of this, once again with NO dents at all."
This was my first time ordering raw cacao powder and I was pleasantly surprised!  The item was packed and shipped professionally and I love the resealable bag.  I initially tasted the cacao by dipping my finger in the bag and I didn't taste anything.  I then placed two tablespoons in my homemade vegetable/fruit juice which normally tastes like bananas...  I was pleasantly surprised because it now tasted like a bona fide chocolate shake!  This is one of the best deals you'll find (online) on certified organic raw cacao and it tastes great.  This is one of the healthiest foods in the world and I recommend this seller if you're looking to purchase it.
"Granda Po's are the perfect snack when you crave something crunchy and delicious.  They are also very healthy so you can enjoy them guilt-free.  I love all the flavors.  My son begs me for them, so now he's a fan too.  I even shipped them to my brother's platoon in Iraq.  Everyone loved them!"
"I hate to say this, but this snack is terrible. No onion flavor what-so-ever.  All it does is gum up your teeth."
Well packed. Few are broken but it is understandable. The cookies are tasty and the notes are interesting. My friends and I really enjoyed it! Thx!
The oatmeal always comes on time or early and the subscription option is such a nice way to save money and buy it in bulk.
Fresh and even better than expected! It tasted like real grapefruit sections dunked in sugar. So good!!
"So far this is the best cola flavoring I've found for those wanting to make their own cola.  It's got stevia in it, so it still doesn't taste 100% like coca cola, but it is SO MUCH BETTER than the nasty cola flavor that sodastream makes.  And hey - no artificial sweeteners is always good!<br /><br />It doesn't taste quite like cola, but it's close enough to make me happy and I liek it for it's own flavor."
"I have had trouble finding these spearmint flavored lifesavers at my local stores. They are good tasting to me, but are only lifesavers. When buying 20 of them I'd hoped, though, that it would be less expensive .. I think it worked out to over $0.70 a roll"
"These crackers are the closest thing to the ""real thing"" I could find. No they do not even hold a candle to Ritz crackers & can sometimes be brittle (we expect that with Gluten Free foods) but they get the job done. I eat mine with peanut butter alot for a light snack. I give them 5 stars (the original), the other flavors... not soo much. One down-side is that they get stale very qucikly so I keep mine in the fridge. Hope this helps!"
"The Avocado oil is delishious. I use it or Baking Biscuits and Bread, Dipping and as a sallad dressing. With the high smoke point, its good for frying. It makes good fryed Eggs. The BIG PLUS IS THE HEALTH BENEFITS.<br />  cjc"
"You cant go wrong with greenies! My dogs love them and go nuts on them. Only downside to this is that its so soft it gets chewed up quickly so i dont quite see how this will improve the dogs teeth and gums.<br /><br />Amazon has the best prices by far and with no tax + amazon prime, this by far, becomes the cheapest place to buy products."
"Yesterday my friend shared with me a bag of this Pom-Raspberry snack from his 12-pack box. The bite-sized crunch is lightly sweet and delicious.  I was instantly hooked and got online to do a lot of research because I had a serious doubt about food products made in China. I really hoped this product would have a clean bill of health so I would feel comfortable buying it regularly.<br /><br />I should say that Mrs. May's website erased a big part of my concerns. First of all, most ingredients were grown in US and Canada. Only three ingredients are sourced from China (rice malt, sesame seeds, and sea salt).  This is important because chemical contamination of China's natural resources is so serious that I won't want to eat a lot of food products grown there without endorsement from very reliable inspection agencies. The company seems to have done a lot of work to make sure the manufacturing process would be safe from microbiological hazard as well.  They also use two 3rd party international inspection agencies.  That being said, I've learned from multiple sources that Chinese factories are known for staging for health inspections. So I cannot just rely on the company's own words.  However, what makes me more convinced is that Whole Foods is one of their buyers.  I think this is an important endorsement for the product.  It makes me feel a lot more comfortable about making the purchase myself.  With the overall food safety concerns removed, I will give this product 4.5 stars.<br /><br />A good reference is Mrs. May's website FAQ on general production.  Since Amazon does not allow pasting of the link here, you can just google the website and check it out."
I had read a lot about the health benefits of using Canidae for my dogs.  I think I have seen evidence of healthier skin in my dog with skin issues.
"Unfortunately, I'm much too frugal to throw away something I've spent perfectly good money on, so I'm continuing to use these suckers until they're gone (hopefully in a few weeks). I thought I was buying a decent brand of coffee, given the Wolfgang Puck name, but alas, I was wrong. Using the middle cup size on my Keurig coffeemaker, these k-cups make a weak cup of coffee... more like brown water. No taste, no nothing. I switched to the smallest size cup and it's marginally better, but still barely drinkable. I wouldn't serve these to guests EVER. I can't wait to be done with these boxes of junk so I can order something with some taste. Please don't waste your money."
I use this on anything that I want to have the scent of truffles on and it never fails.<br />I've finished a bottle and order two more. Thumbs up!
These are very colorful but not the best tasting. I used them for my sons first bday as we were having a very large party and didn't want to buy 20 mini cans but taste wise the quality was not there....the look was great. I'm sure no one knew any better after all frosting fixes all.
"I honestly don't know how this product could have garnered so many five-star reviews. I bought it for my senior dogs (14 years old) when their usual joint treats (Pet Naturals of Vermont soft chews) were out of stock, since one of my dogs is very finicky about what glucosamine supplements he'll take, and I had tried everything else available without success. I gave both of them the recommended dosage, based on their weights (15 and 24 lbs), and was delighted to see that they happily accepted the treats.  Within 12 hours, though, my Yorkie had raging diarrhea and my Eskie-poo had vomited forcefully, which was very unusual for both of them. Not realizing it was this product, I tried it again a couple of days after nursing them back to health, with the exact same effect. Internet searches confirmed that other users have similarly reported nasty GI side effects with this product."
Kavli Crispy Thin Crispbread is the right consistency for multiple uses.  The taste is fantastic.  It's fresh and pleasant to eat.  Kavli products are the best.
Please contact the manufacturer and ask them to change back to the old formula if you love this product! We just cancelled our subscription of 8 cases per month because the new formula is disgusting! Not buying again unless the change back to the old version!
"There's a reason why this noodle soup won the Chefs Best Awards, because it's just good, perfect flavor, perfect noodles and perfect amount of spiciness.<br /><br />Instructions are easy, you know the drill, add water and microwave, it doesn't get any easier than that.<br /><br />bottom line is, I love these noodles and highly recommend them."
"We have been ordering these chicken jerky treats for a long time with Amazon subscribe and save. My Boston Terriers really love them and get very excited to get their treat every morning. When I opened a bag from my most recent shipment, my dogs refused to take the treat from my hand. They took one sniff and backed away. My son's Lab got very sick from chicken jerky made in China and his vet told him to only buy treats made in the U.S.and I'm going to follow that advice."
"Expensive, nasty and low in protein! I really don't understand how this product has got good reviews. I am not exagerating but the taste is nasty. I drunk it once and the rest I flushed through the toilet. Bad!"
"I have had many dogs and cats throughout my adult life. I have tried many animal foods and always go back to Purina products. I just wish I would have signed up for automatic delivery for Fresh Step Kitty litter and dry cat food and Purina Dog and Puppy Chow since I also order pet food for www.canine-comfort.org ,which I am the President of, the first non profit rescue organization in ""bush"" Alaska. We sure can use the help on the cost of postage out here...Thank You for this opportunity to share this review...Kathy Sweeney of Canine.Comfort@hotmail.com !!!"
"Very much satisfied! The box of chocolate arrived just in time for the party. Everyone enjoyed them so much that I am putting in another order for new years.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KJRF40"">Very Special Liquor Filled Chocolates 48 Count Christmas Holiday Gift Box Chocolate Gift Pack</a>"
"Great for abrasions.  Kept a slow healing/nonhealing venus ulcer on my father's leg infection free and actually healed it.  He had it for years and all the stuff the doctor's prescribed from the specialized wound care center hadn't been able to heal it.  Lots of stuff now on the market which may not be as good.  Read carefully about Manuka Honey and the various stuff that is being sold.  Seems like many companies have jumped on it and I'm not sure all are as pure or really from New Zealand Manuka ""bee farms""."
I gave this as a stocking stuffer to my husband to remind him of our last holiday in beautiful Jamaica.  It has a truly tropical taste that is very unique and yummy.
The Dingo mini peanut butter bones are a favorite for our 11-year old Yorkie. Be forewarned - she won't eat any other bones any more!
"It may be unfair for me to rate this one star for something that I should have noticed beforehand, but so be it. I bought these beans as part of my preparation for moving overseas. I was able to get most everything I needed locally but wanted some beans and ordered them here. I didn't look at the receipt until I got settled in Nigeria and the bulk shipment arrived. Imagine my shock at realizing I'd paid $26.21 for the beans and $20.89 for shipping on them. And this was with the ""We've shipped this part of your order separately at no extra cost""!<br /><br />If you've got Prime this may be worth the convenience but otherwise, don't bother."
"To be honest, although I've always enjoyed anything with Paul Newman's name on it and have always reordered things, this time I would not. I really like coffee. This reminded me of instant."
"My Greyhounds 7 and 8 years old( both Brood Matrons) loved this lip smacking food. It has given them more energy and their coats are looking wonderful. In fact when you open the bag the food smells like fruit and veg. Changing to Annamaet grainless Salcha,which is small kibbles, from the old food does take a gradual process for the older dogs not because of its size, but because of its high quality. Lastly the company has never had a recall on its products, something we all look for today."
"It makes for a quick snack, but Jeebus, this thing is salty! I usually have to eat it will something else (protein shake, etc), to dull the salty tang.<br />Aside from that, it's quick, convenient, and gives me a quick dose of nutrition when I least have time to prepare a healthy home-cooked meal post-workout."
"I use these to keep my finicky toddler's protein levels up. What's great, is that they're delicious just about any way you can imagine cooking a sausage!<br /><br />A favorite Recipe: Sautee one large onion, about a tablespoon each dried basil and oregano, and some salt and pepper in about 2T of butter. Add sausage, that's been cut into coins, and russet potatoes cut into 1/4"" thick rounds. Cover all with chicken stock and simmer until potatoes are soft but not dissolved. Throw in a few handfuls of pre-washed baby spinach (I usually use about a half a pound, and frozen would work fine, just put it in a minute earlier). Stir until the spinach is cooked, and then serve! Enjoy!"
"I tried quite a few varieties of this brand and the pineapple is the best.  Light but refreshing.  I am not sure if I think it is a miracle elixer or anything but I did purchase a case and look forward to drinking this on a regular basis.  Thank you for the great value and convenience, Amazon."
"My dog is a destroyer of every toy I buy her, so I was looking for something that could keep her attention and something she couldn't easily destroy. Thankfully, I found this! My dog loves it and it keeps her entertained for hours! I use Cheerio's instead of dog treats, I think its a healthier snack and its certainlly cheaper! I would definatly recommend this toy for any dog."
"This is a great drink.  It is just like water with no syrupy taste or texture.  I really enjoy the berry and lime flavors.  No sugar, no salt, no calories, just a little natural sweetener (which is subtle)... need I say more?"
the best flavor in this box is the salt and pepper and the bbq flavor.  all the other flavor was just so-so
"Every store in my area stopped carrying Sugarless Bubble Yum, which ended up working out just fine cuz I received my order in four days and the 48% off retail more than made up for the shipping!"
these are the best green olives on the planet. i buy cases of these. they are well over 4.50 at some stores. i get them here when they are avail.
"I think this is a good toy, but its too hard for my Border Collie to get his food or treats. Food should be smaller to drop it more easily."
"I am not a huge morning coffee person as this seems to be the only time of day black coffee upsets my stomach. No idea why. My work got a Keurig recently and buy the Caribou regular and morning blends, which are ok but I can hardly drink them unless there's a creamer of some sort in them.<br /><br />So on a recent trip to BB&B I perused their wall of K-cups and this one caught my eye. I am generally a fan of flavored coffees and this sounded good, so I bought an 18 cup pack. I have to say it is delicious! The coconut flavor is light but definitely there, and doesn't leave a bitter aftertaste like most black coffees do. It smells so good my co-workers have done a 180 walking by my desk to ask me what smells so good.<br /><br />Obviously if you're a coffee connoisseur this won't be for you, but if not it is definitely worth a shot. And the best part for me, aside from the flavor, no stomach upset!"
"The bag should have been labeled ""Mice Ears"".  There wasn't a decent sized ear in the bag.  I will buy from the local pet store from now on.  The price ended up being the same and the quality is better."
"I like ""Vernor's"", and drink it all the time. It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime. The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is ""The Vernor's Story: From Gnomes to Now"" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor's fans."
"...so you know I am serious. I would give it a 0, were it an option. I love Amazon - they have never let me down, so I am hoping they come through for me when I file a claim with them.<br /><br />The product was rock hard, so I followed the enclosed instructions and heated it even less than the recommended time in the microwave. It kneaded easily enough and smelled/ tasted good. When it came to rolling, I could tell immediately that this was going to be a challenge. Sure enough, it tore all over the place. Redo. I used cornstarch, the way I was taught, and it still stuck to every surface as if it were too warm or wet, yet cracked as if it were too dry. Nothing made it cooperate, so I lowered my standards and draped it anyway. Durring the two-foot trip from the rolling surface to the cake, it ripped in several places and the application to the cake ended in absolute disaster. No, I did not roll it too thin. Yes, I used cornstarch (even though the packaging specifically claims it is unnecessary.) It sucks. The end."
"If you don't pour the liquid in slowly like the directions say (and I mean a trickle of liquid) then the texture comes out gooey.  It took me three tries (three different boxes) to get it right.  But even then, I could not get past the bitter taste.  Contrary to what the Chebe folks say, manioc (tapioca) flour has a slightly bitter taste to it.<br />I now have five boxes of Chebe mix to throw away.<br />I have Celiac disease and cannot have gluten, so I am back to trying out different brown rice flour recipes until I find one that works."
This tea tastes so good. It has a sweet caramel and vanilla taste. It is perfect with some milk or cream.
"I tried this tea because I am an insomniac, and wanted something to help put me to sleep. Unfortunately, I can barely palette this tea because of its wretched last note and after-taste of Stevia. I have never tasted Stevia before, but after reading the other reviews I instantly knew that was the issue. It goes into my throat and just tastes disgustingly sweet. Not in a good way, either.<br /><br />I don't usually put sugar or milk in any of my tea-- I am one of those people who drinks strong black chais straight up. So this is a complete killer for me. If you like super sweet teas, this may be for you, but I don't understand why they would put a sweetener in their tea. If they're going to do that, perhaps they should make a separate version without the Stevia.<br /><br />I won't be purchasing this again, and I continue my hunt for very strong sleepytime teas that aren't sweet, fruity, or minty."
"The Pork Shake N Bake has always been a simple way to make any old chop a good bit tastier. With minimal mess, trouble and time, you get healthier-than-fried breaded chops that are juicy and taste good. It's not exactly gourmet, but after a long day, it's an easy way to start a meal without having to resort to fast food. The seasoning in the Shake N Bake make the pork sufficiently tasty, but doesn't overpower it like some mixes can.<br /><br />If I have one complaint, it's that you may need more than one pouch if you're cooking more than 3 or 4 chops. I was probably being a bit liberal with them, but I had enough for three thick-cut boneless pork chops and there wasn't much left over (maybe a tablespoon). That's a minor gripe, but if you're cooking a lot of chops, especially thick ones, you're going to need more than a single pouch."
"I wish I could say that I've tried this and love it, however, I can't because I haven't received it yet.  It's been over 2 weeks since I made this purchase and it hasn't even shipped yet; and when I bought this it said it was in stock, so I don't know what's taking so long.  I don't think I'll buy this again because the wait is ridiculous."
Of all the coffee's available for Tassimo this Kona has the richest flavor and fantastic aroma by<br />far my favorite.
The Dagoba dark chocolate bar did not taste good. They taste like artificial chocolate. I had to throw them away. Learn and live.
"This tastes just like the iced tea you buy at Starbucks. I like it better because I make it with purified, filtered water. Great tea"
My dogs love these bones.  I bought all sizes.  My jack russel loves the big ones and the small ones.  My 60 pound mutt loves the big ones. They are great.  They are able to digest them and able to enjoy the bones.  I bought so many of them.  Petsmart for some reason discontinued them I was so upset.  I was so happy to see them on Amazon for a great price. I highly recommend them.
"If anyone knows of one that does not have it, please let me know! It definitely isn't very strong, but I coulod handle it if it didn't have the artificial sweetener aftertaste.This has artificial sweetener (sucorse)  just like the other hot chocolates out there."
"According to the manufacturer's website, this (and many of their other products) contains menadione sodium bisulfite complex.<br /><br />Menadione is a synthetic precursor for Vitamin K and has been reported to have toxic effects. The use of menadione over the natural alternatives (such as leafy greens and kelp) is only for cost-saving reasons, hence usually only found in cheaper and lower quality animal food. It's surprising that pet food at this high of a price actually contains this substance.<br /><br />Menadione is banned by the Food & Drug Administration in over-the-counter supplements due to its potential for organ toxicity. It's also banned in Europe for human consumption.<br /><br />A study in rats showed that exposure to menadione ""produced lesions in the kidney, heart, liver and lung."" Chiou et al. Toxicology 1997.<br /><br />Menadione's toxicity seems to be due to its ability to induce oxidative stress in cells.<br /><br />Do an online search for menadione and you'll find more info from a pet food watchdog trying to stop the inclusion of this substance.<br /><br />In light of recent episodes of toxic pet food and the questionable behaviors of manufacturers and our regulatory agencies, I would advise you to avoid feeding this to your cats."
"These are much too sweet for my tastes. I couldn't really taste the nuts or the fruit because of all the glucose syrup (the second ingredient on the list - honey would have been a much tastier sweetening option, but they only used a tiny bit of honey) and all of the bits of puffed white rice (again just another form of sugar) overpowers any other tastes. All I tasted was sugar and bland white rice. I did give it two stars because the bar did have a lot of nuts. Too bad I couldn't taste them. A much tastier option is the Kind brand fruit and nut bars. Theirs are also gluten-free, and they use honey as the primary sweetener and use the sweetener more sparingly, so that you can really taste the nuts and fruit. Amazon sells that brand too, and I'll be going back to that brand. These two are my faves from them:<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFVYF0"">KIND Bar Nut Delight, 1.4-Ounce Bars (Pack of 8)</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FFVYEQ"">KIND Bar Almond & Apricot, 1.4-Ounce Bars (Pack of 8)</a><br /><br />Thought I'd give the Eat Natural brand a try just for variety, but it reminded me that just because something is natural, doesn't mean it's good for you. Too much glucose is not good for anyone. And remember, hemlock is natural too. That's certainly not good for you either... :)"
"I bought this based on the other reviews and I have to say this coffee is the best I have ever had without any reservations.  I drink on average six to eight cups of coffee a day and I own a top of the line super automatic espresso machine, so needless to say I have tried a lott of different brands and blends.  Buy this, you wont regret it."
"After 5 years with the Keurig, this is the best .  If you like a medium blend, it perfect.  Its smooth, and has taste. Not watered down on either setting."
"All and all it is my fault because I did not pay attention to what I ordered. When I went to the Jack's Links website it advertised white meat 95 to 97 percent fat free. At the time they did not have this product for purchase. So when I received an email saying it was now available I hurried and ordered it. It is not until I received the order did I realize I had ordered dark meat. I did not even know that dark meat was available; therefore, I was shocked and felt deceived. Yet, I had tasted the chicken nuggetts before reading the content and was wondering why was it so salty. I did get a formal apology in writing from jack's links but again it is still my fault for not paying attention. Now I am stuck with many packets of dark meat chicken nuggets. In conclusion, I guess it is still a little bit healthier than the beef. (maybe)"
"We used this cereal when my daughter was a baby 2 years ago and it was great. I ordered a case recently for my 8 month old son and it was spoiled! Amazon was great and refunded my money, but I am so disappointed with HAPPYBELLIES. There are obviously some major quality control issues that need to be addressed. I will be ordering baby cereal from a different company as I just can't bring myself to trust HAPPYBELLIES anymore."
"The other review is correct... artificial color has been added to a great product and ruined it. The genius behind this decision should be tarred and feathered and run out of town on rail... ok, then, just fire them. The Altoid customer base, I would imagine, prefer natural ingredients and don't want crap... this is crap. The marketing genius behind this decision canNOT be a regular user of Altoids... any regular user would have known better... don't destroy a winner to make it look ""pretty"". I'm eating them for pete's sake, not dating them.<br /><br />Same with the Spearmint. Ruined by artificial color and ingredients.<br /><br />Duh... I guess I am too stupid to know the difference... Duh.<br /><br />I am still buying the Peppermint... for now. As far as I know, it is the only Altoid mint that still uses natural peppermint oil and no artificial colors... for now.<br /><br />OOoh oooh... how about this, marketing geniuses at Altoid... artificially colored red stripes in the Peppermint. Brilliant! Seriously, anybody that sees this and think it's a good idea needs to be FIRED."
These taste wonderful!  Guilt free if you can stop at one bag.  Will definitly buy again!
"I know how healthy oatmeal is supposed to be for you, but I have never found a brand with a flavor much less a texture that I could ever tolerate. No matter how much I doctored it up, it was still slimy stuff with pieces of other stuff in it.<br />  I thought I would give it one more try, and lo and behold, this is the best oatmeal I have EVER EATEN in my ENTIRE LIFE. And I am in my 60's!!!! If you have ever had an aversion to oatmeal as I have, you WILL be able to eat this oatmeal.  Perhaps it is the mixture of the barley and dried fruit that does it.<br />  My first cup I tried straight up, and it was sweet and delightful.  Next cup I tried adding some brown sugar, but you know, I think it was a bit too sweet, and I decided it was just fine all on its own.<br />  The portion is large and very filling, it makes a satisfying breakfast.<br />Bottom line, I am hooked for life on this stuff.  Give it a try, you will not be disappointed. 8-)"
There really needs to be information on these sorts of products on the amount contained in the jar. Many people like to know how much per ounce they are buying.
"This is much too watery. It tastes very much like the tasteless hot cocoa one gets out of a vending machine.  After receiving the box and reading the list of ingredients,  I've decided not to order again.  This product if definitely not worth the money."
"Of all the K-Cup flavors we've brewed, this is the best.  It is so good that we have actually subscribed (15% discount!) to receive these boxes every couple months.  The flavor is great and it is extremely convenient in the morning to just pop the K-Cup in our brewer and 15 seconds later we have a hot cup of coffee."
"I don't like sweet potatoes but I do like sweet potato fries.  I love these Popchips Sweet Potato Chips, they are very tasty.  There isn't a lot of salt, fat, or carbs.  My only complaint is each bag only contains .8 ounces, but I guess they wanted the bag to be exactly 100 calories.<br /><br />The rest of the Popchips line is great too.  Not fried or baked, and reasonably healthy."
"I just started using this about 2 months ago and I love it!  It has really transformed my baked chicken from so-so to a well-seasoned, tasty dish.  When I first tried it on fish, I used too much, not realizing the sodium content.  Next time, I just adjusted accordingly, added a pat of butter and ended up with delicious tilapia.  I recommend it as a staple to your spice cabinet."
"my dog loves these, they are so expensive to buy individually. these are great and clean the teeth. i hold onto one end and rotate it around, kinda like a toothbrush so it cleans her teeth!"
Gum sticks to my teeth and flavor doesn't last long at all.  It's ok for vending machine gum and it was a decent price but the gum itself is not that good.
"My family loves this granola!  Whether sprinkling it on their yogurt or eating it in a bowl with milk, it has a great taste!!  The 26 ounce bags are an excellent value!"
"My partner is very happy with the tea, and is feeling much better since starting to drink it.<br />She has been drinking it both hot (normal) and iced (chilled) and likes the refreshing nature of it."
"I had no idea something could taste this good. I'm not really a caramel person, but if I had dreamed up the most perfect balance between sweet-salty-buttery richness it would be these Caramel Sea Salt Squares. I found them at Whole Foods and they are expensive, but worth every penny. Milk is the perfect compliment. Get some and you will not be disappointed. You may be ruined for chocolate brownies."
"The cookies are great, though they arrived with many of them in pieces - the packaging was totally incompetent and ineffective. A huge, wasteful carton with a couple of plastic bubbles and the packs of cookies rattling around. Shippers need to rethink this useless and unsustainable packaging."
"Just tried the Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers Chicken Teriyaki for lunch today. It's easy to prepare. The rice was fine. However, the ""sauce"", a brown mixture of mushy, small cubes of chicken, and small tidbits of pineapple, was bland, soft, unappealing and fairly flavorless. I wouldn't buy it again. It wasn't bad; it just wasn't tasty, either. At least it's only about 400 calories."
"Our retriever, Elvis, tried to open the package himself.  After a little assistance from opposable thumbs, he stuck his snout into the bag and retrieved one.  It didn't last long.<br /><br />This is indeed an all-organic product, according to the label, and this company has enough integrity that it's not in doubt.  Barley, lamb, carrots, apples, palm oil, and molasses, all listed as certified organic by Oregon Tilth.  Low fat (4%), crunchy, about the size and shape of a Fig Newton.<br /><br />I used to joke about organic foods.  Having read up on the subject, I find that it's verifiably (not just anecdotally) healthier for humans to avoid preservatives and other artificial additives.  Natural foods are more easily and fully digested, and don't tax the system as much as the cheaper products with long lists of additives.  It stands to reason your dog's system is the same.<br /><br />Elvis will have a hunk o' hunk o' organic Newman treats, please.  While he WILL eat anything but okra (no joke), he's not always this enthusiastic about it.  Mr. Newman, keep up the good work."
"I can't speak for myself, but my dog usually hates most ""dog biscuit""  style treats.  In contrast to her usual preference, these were a strong favorite.  They don't smell or feel like meat, and have no greasy residue that many meaty treats have.  But the dog loves them like they are chunks of beef."
"I was told by a professional baker to use powdered food coloring as it was the only way to go when making colored cakes and french macarons. What a disappointment. I ended up adding almost a tablespoon to my french macaron batter and it was such a pale color, that it wasn't worth adding a whole canister at the price. This isn't the way to go if you want bright vibrant colors."
"I have bought ""Farmer's Market Organic Pumpkin(100%)"" for years from coops, health/natural groceries, but now Amazon Subscribe and Save is my supplier for cost and free shipping.  Pumpkin is a great source of Vit.A(380%), Fiber(16%), Iron(10%), Phytocytes, etc per 50cal/serving, but this brand TASTES good, as well as, provides nutrition.  I generally eat it right from the can for an evening snack; the product is that good."
"I discovered this product a couple of years ago and really liked the taste in coffee , tea and on fruit and oatmeal.  It was a lot less expensive in the packets then, but I've switched to the large 12 oz. container and the price is very good. I don't use sugar and this helps me have the ""sweet"" and not the increased blood sugar-YEAH!!"
"I love Kame Rice crackers. The wasabi are the best unless you ask my wife who prefers the original.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EPR1J4"">Ka-Me Rice Crunch, Wasabi, 3.5-Ounce Units (Pack of 12)</a>"
"I tried to find israeli couscous in a number of upsacale grocery stores and no luck.  So I decided to try good ole Amazon.com and selected this product.  It is so good..add a few herbs and it's a great side dish, or add more and make a ""pasta type"" salad.so very good.  I am hooked.  Great flavor and so easy to prepare!"
Sesmark makes a very high quality rice cracker and then proceeds to ruin it by loading it up with so much salt as to make it inedible.  USE CAUTION before buying this item since there are NO RETURNS and you might find yourself with a throw away.
"Amazon outside packaging arrived in great shape!  Unfortunately downhill from there.  Carton containing creamers was damaged; original box seal was taped over (re-sealed previously opened?); use by date on outside of box indicated 4 months (typically these have at least 12 months, usually 18). Sent feedback to Amazon several days ago.  Apparently fell on deaf ears (i.e., no response from Amazon)."
I love white polenta but most of what I find in the U.S. is very coarse.  It still tastes great but the texture leaves a lot to be desired.  Moretti Polenta Friulana Bianco is amazing - the creamiest and finest I have ever seen.
"My dog has been eating this food for the last three years.  Every food I fed him before this caused smelly gas problems.  He almost never has gas on this food.  Also, people often comment on how good he smells.  However, when he goes to grandma's and eats junk food for a week or two he always comes home smelling like a dog.  It's totally the food.  On top of that, he loves it.  Love it!"
"I had been buying these treats for my cavachon for the past two years. He loved them.<br /><br />The last batch was of noticeably lower quality...dry and crunchy rather than moist and chewy. I don't know if this is due to the shift in manufacturing from the US to China or coincidental. In any event, I will not be buying these any more and have switched to other treats.<br /><br />Note, Amazon would not let me return this item, and I am within the 30 day purchase period. I'm not pleased."
Best flavor ever!  I'm addicted!  They are all good but these are by far the best.  I could live on these!  And there is no need for anymore to say....
"My husband likes these a lot. They are a bit different to get used to as they are less greasy and salty in taste than the usual chips you buy. They are more browner than I would like to see and the chips are pretty sturdy in texture. Not bad, though. Just takes getting used to eating chips better for your health. They do have about 1/2 the calories in fat, however."
"Great for when you are in too much of a hurry to cook breakfast or make a lunch.  The flavor is rich and chocolatey, add a bannana, a cup of 2% milk, blend it up and you are good to go."
"Okay, when you try to go gluten or wheat free there are many things that you miss.  A nice fresh loaf of bread happens to be number one, but a close second is a wonderful pan of moist brownies.  The sad thing is that many gluten-free mixes end up with products that are coarse and dry...and, believe me, I've tried many.<br /><br />This one, however, is fabulous.  You'd never know it was gluten free.  In fact, if you make it for people who aren't going gluten free, they'll never know.  But why do that?  They can have their regular old brownies and you can have these...all for yourself.<br /><br />Easy to make.  Moist.  Nice texture.  They don't even need frosting.  Just sprinkle some powdered sugar on top if you like (if you sprinkle it through a doily it will make a pattern for fancy events).  I've also added nuts to this mix, such as almonds, walnuts, and even brazil nuts.<br /><br />Simply heaven."
"I have tried all of these nuts and they are fantastic.  I highly recommend them as a snack which is not only healthy, but tasty.  The mulberries combined with chocolate are amazing."
"These are thick, hearty treats that come in squares of two you can break apart. They smell like graham crackers!! My dog is very picky and really loves these snacks. He also has very sensitive skin and so far so good with that. No hot spots or anything. His food is an organic duck/rice mix with no fillers. The ingredients on these treats are simple as well.  I will be buying these again!"
"These crisps are my favorite.  I ordered these expecting to get them in a month or two, and to my surprise they arrived in just 8 days!!!<br />I immediately ordered 8 more 6 packs, as my entire family wants these crisps.<br />Fantastic company I ordered from.  I am more than pleased!!!!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004X9XTIE"">Walkers Worcester Sauce Crisps 6 Pack 150g</a>"
"This ghee is the best available -- the fat is high quality and the nutrients are powerful, due to the fact that the ghee is made from grass-fed butter during the spring and fall season, when the cows are eating fast-growing green grass. That last part is important -- that means that this ghee has high amounts of K2 compared to other ghees. K2 is the great bone and teeth-building nutrient; it helps the body deposit calcium appropriately. K2 cannot be gotten from green leafy vegetables -- it can only be gotten from animal fats, organ meats, or some kinds of fermented vegetables.<br /><br />Also, apparently this ghee has tested as high in K2 as the very expensive ""butter oil"" that I used to buy.<br /><br />Finally, I've seen an improvement in my kids' teeth since I've been giving them several spoonfuls of ghee each day. We use it like a supplement.<br /><br />Thank you for a high quality product!"
"i've ordered this several times.  each time it arrives with the bottom 1/3 of the package just dust.  for this price i would think the majority of the bag would be whole pieces.  i've complained several times, but nothing changes.  they don't ship it any more carefully and it comes 1/3 dust."
"Local store's discontinued sale - 3.50 USD.<br /><br />I bought a jar.<br /><br />Upon eating some I was stunned at what was happening to my mouth. Eager to replicate the impossible, I took another spoonful.<br /><br />The next day I bought the rest of the jars. There are no more jars. After the last I slept for 20 hours.<br /><br />I'm scared. If I order more, part of me will be satiated, but at a terrible cost to my faculties. The agonizing wait makes purchasing a zero sum game.<br /><br />Apricots taste like ash now."
"We bought this after reading about it on Dr. Sear's website. Our son has had no problems at all with the formula, we add brown rice syrup per our pediatricians recommendation (to add calories) Our son was a preemie, and was EBF for the first 7 months until stress from work affected milk production. Our son took to the goats milk right away, we mixed the first couple bottles with breastmilk until we knew he had no digestive issues with it, then were able to give him goats milk by itself. The goats milk smells and tastes better when warm than cold. I grew up on goats milk myself, so the taste doesn't bother me, but my husband isn't crazy about. Good thing our son loves it, because that's what really counts! It's 1/3 the cost of convential (cow's milk based) formula and is easier for tiny tummies to digest. It's a win-win all around!"
"My beagle loves these bones. We give them to her every sunday as a treat after clipping nails, getting a bath or cleaning her ears. She gets so excited when I pull one out of the bag. She loves them so much that I have signed up for subscribe and save to receive them every month."
"My dogs enjoy any type of ""puppy cookie"", they're not picky at all. But I noticed that in feeding them this product they started to prefer this brand over all others! I am happy knowing they enjoy it, but I'm even happier knowing that it is filled with all sorts of good ""real"" food - not by-products and what not. I would highly recommend these!"
"Bought through Amazon as Snap-Bits are difficult to find in pet stores.  My dog is on a diet and the only treats she can have are few Cheerios, baby carrots cut into little pieces (and yes she eats them) and ice cubes.  Snap-bits are her extra special treat and she knows when they are in my hand.  She really likes it when I roll one along the floor for her to chase after and chomp it down."
"I foolishly purchased the HARMONY FARMS Healthy & Holistic Adult Dog Food, since it had more for the same price(why it had good reviews is beyond me). My dogs will not touch the harmony farms, yet love this dog food. My 10 wk. old pup had ""slimmy poop"", until the day I feed her this food. Both my dogs love it.Newman's Own Organics Adult Dog Food Formula is the way to go."
"My father could no longer take care of his beloved 6 year old Cocker Spaniel, so I decided to take her into my family. When I brought her to NYC she had ear and eye discharge. She was also  slightly overweight. After a check up with a vet that ruled out infection, I decided to try Royal Canin based on the numerous good reviews.Within a week her ear and eye problems were gone and she dropped a good amount of weight. This is going to be the only food that we will be feeding her!"
Individually packaged assorted rice crackers are really good.  I could without all the packaging.  Really great price for a high quality mix of rice crackers with some wasabi peas included.  I mixed with salted peanuts for a delicious snack.
"The Presidor Allegro Crispy Cookies with Hazelnut Filling are a tasty, crunchy treat with kind of a dry center.  When I see filling, I think of creamy filling, but this was more of a dried Hazelnut paste.  The cookies have a good flavor and there are two rows of them in a nice box.  The box is presentable enough for the cookies to be a little gift for someone.  I enjoyed them hence the 4 stars, but I don't really crave them as a cookie favorite or 5 stars.  At the right price, I would buy them again."
"Gimme better ingredients (KIND/Larabars) for more $ or sweeter items (genuine junk) for less $. Not sure I'd invest in a single bar again, let alone this size."
I love this tea!  My favorite part is that the tea bags are NOT individually wrapped and don't have a string.  I use this tea in my Iced Tea Maker (by Mr Coffee) and it works perfectly because I don't have to unwrap all the bags.
"I like the aroma and flavor of coffee but many brands, particularly the big ""S"" brand, do a job on my stomach.  I was anxious to try Puroast low acid coffee.  I prepared it in a drip coffeemaker.  I was highly disappointed with the brewed coffee.  I don't use sugar in my coffee but this definitely needed it.  The taste and aroma were awful.  It has a burnt flavor, even for a French roast and extremely bitter aftertaste.  The aroma was not particularly inviting either.<br /><br />I wish I still had my PH meter because I would have loved to test the acidity of this coffee vs. regular coffee.  Based on the bitter aftertaste and how it reacted on my stomach, I'd guess it is anything but low acid but I have no scientific means to validate my subjective opinion.  Frankly, even if it is low acid, I can't ""stomach"" the taste."
"I should have listened to the other reviewers who said this was NOT the candy they remembered - but I didn't. Instead, I ended up with a bad tasting and stale (almost impossible to chew) $30 box of candy. DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!"
The tea arrived as advertised.  It was a gift for my parents who love to have tea.  They do not like any Herbal varieties. Twinings tea is always good and this selection of teas (non - Herbal) was perfect for them.
This is an excellent tea.  One of the best I have ever had.  It is especially great when you prepare it with a samovar.
"My son wouldn't eat it either! I tasted it... I would not eat it, also. Tasteless, unappetizing in texture and  flavor.<br />It says ""minimal processing""... does that mean it is not even cooked? No wonder our babies and toddlers hate it!!! I would NEVER knowingly feed my child or myself RAW meat."
"My 60 lb dog LOVES these.  She is very picky about food and treats, but eats this readily.  She needs the glucosamine/chondroitin for her knees and even if I hid the pills in cat food, peanut butter, you name it- she wouldn't touch it.  She also has allergies to a lot of common ingredients (chicken, beef, wheat), so really this treat is a lifesaver!"
"This is some really nice tea.  Even brewed slightly weak, the flavor comes through.  The scent will fill your whole house and just make everything seem a little bit better.  If you like Earl Grey, this is definately a brand to give a try."
"WHEN WE TASTED THIS HONEY WE WERE QUITE DISAPPOINTED.<br /><br />IT IS HONEY BUT WITH  - NO -  FLAVOR OF CLOVER.<br /><br />TASTES LIKE MIXED WILD FLOWERS - OK BUT NOT CLOVER.<br /><br />I  HAVE BEEN EATING CLOVER HONEY FOR 50 YEARS AND THIS IS NOT IT.<br /><br />SAD THAT THE SELLER IS CHEATING FOLKS WITH THIS  "" CLOVER ""  HONEY.<br /><br />LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR REAL CLOVER HONEY - DON'T TRUST ANNA'S HONEY."
"I got a sample of this product at an expo. My papillon loved it, so I decided to purchase more.  This has turned out to be such a great product for her, as her hips and neck were so sore and stiff prior to her experience with Happy Hips.....  The doctor had told us she had disc problems in her neck, she would walk around and scream in pain all the time.  She seemed to just be deteriorating right before our eyes.  Now, after just a few weeks of giving her one to two a day, she is running and bouncing and playing just like a puppy again.  She plays with our other 2 dogs and it's a joy to watch.  We used to give her liquid medicine for this, and it never made her feel THIS good.  This is a product I will continue to buy over and over......"
I ORDERED KETTLE CHIPS IN THE FOLLOWING FLAVVORS<br />SALT & FRESH GROUND PEPPER<br />TUSCAN 3 CHEESE<br />N.Y. CHEDDAR AND HERS<br /><br />THEY ALL TASTED THE SAME TO ME.  IF THERE IS A VARIETY PACK SUGGEST U ORDER BEFORE ORDERING LARGE SIZE.<br /><br />I WISH I COULD RETURN THE UNOPENED BAGS.
"I will never order from this person again. They took what would be 1. pig ear and cut it into 3 very small strips. Instead of my dog getting one full pig ear he got  strips of a pig ear. What was even worse is that I got 25 pieces of the strips which was equivalent to maybe 8 full size pig ears. I'm sticking with Sam's or Costco. This place ripped me off by charging $17 bucks for strips instead of a full ear.  Additionally, the strips had the hair still attached. My dog loved them anyway but I had to give him 3 at a time to make up for the 1 so the bag lasted for a week. Terrible!!!"
The last bag of these I got from Amazon had a lot of hollow bisquits.  It was weird ......  they just weren't solid like they should be.  I'm going to switch to another brand of grain-free dog bisquits now as there's no sense in paying for something I'm not getting (and these are expensive!)  And if it wasn't for the good packaging I'd wonder if bugs had gotten to them..... but I don't think that's possible.
"Thank you for the best gluten free pasta I have found so far!  This even has enough of a great texture to survive crock-pot macaroni and cheese!  My kids, my husband, and I love this pasta.  Thanks Tinkyada!  I buy this by the case."
"While beef stew is almost too easy to make, I will admit to not being great at replenishing my seasonings supplies as needed. Because seasonings and spices/herbs are so expensive, I keep putting off purchasing them and the list to replenish them just keeps getting longer and longer. Eventually, I don't have anything with which to work. As such, I planned 2 6-qt crock pots of beef stew for over the holidays to always have something hearty and warm on hand for family as they came/went.  Lo and behold, when I finished cutting up all the meat and veggies and loaded them into the crock pots, I had nothing on hand to actually flavor those main ingredients. So, sent hubby off to the grocery store for a quick cheat...McCormick's beef stew seasoning packets. Of course I never told him how many to get, and as he wanted to 'do it right the first trip', he got a handful of them. Actually, in error, he grabbed the ones I'd never seen before: the ""SLOW COOKERS"" item. Man, oh, man! To heck with buying expensive, one-jar spices to keep on hand for this meal. This product worked perfectly! Open packet, mix with 1 1/3 Cups water, pour over ingredients in crock pot, mix it up just once and let the cooker rip for a few hours. The stew was excellently cooked, beef was so tender one needed a spoon with which to lift it otherwise it would break apart and the veggies were tender but not mooshy. It was more than flavorful; the au jus was not too thick and not too thin - perfect for sopping up with homemade bread that, unlike my spices, is always available in this house.<br /><br />I liked it so much, as did the family members, I'm back to purchase the pack of 12 here to keep on hand as well as the ""SLOW COOKERS"" for pot roast. I confess, for these two meals from now on, I'm being lazy, but quick and efficient. No serious measuring, no countless bottles of assorted spices, no mess and a tremendous result.<br /><br />NOTE: I did use 2 packets for each 6-qt slow cooker for although there is an easy recipe on the reverse of the packet, I don't measure my meat and veggies. I use what I have on hand and once the crock pot is at least 3/4 full, that's when I usually throw in my seasonings. The recipe provided would not be enough for my family. I didn't notice any additional recommendations on the packets indicating how much for what size slow cooker. I began with just one packet dissolved in the recommended 1 1/3 Cups of water (I used boiling water to dissolve it quicker add some warmth to the slow cooker as it begins cooking), but after pouring it over all the meat and veggies in the first pot, I just didn't think 1 packet was enough as my family likes a lot of the 'gravy'.  Therefore, I added an additional prepared packet to each 6-qt crock pot which gave me perfect results.<br /><br />This product uses only natural spices, no MSG, 0g trans fat per serving and no artificial flavors.<br /><br />Edit: 1/2/10 - Another batch made for New Year's...this time, I reduced the amount of water per packet to 1 Cup (vs 1 1/3) and got thicker, more substantial 'gravy' vs  the usual 'au jus' consistency. The family liked it much, much better that way."
"I don't know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere, but they were so old that they wouldn't cook.  I had to throw half of them out, because the skins were damaged, a clear sign of dried beans past their prime.  I can't even return these or ask for a refund, because food is not returnable.  Will find a different brand to use.  For now, I have about fifty servings of beans to throw away."
"I love this water! I started buying it after my Bikram yoga classes to rehydrate, and now drink it whenever I feel a little dehydrated.  Living in AZ, I tend to not drink enough water so these help tremendously and are delicious too!  Try them! You'll be hooked :)"
"Hickory Smoked Primal Jerky is awesome! Jerky is one of the few things I have really missed since becoming a vegetarian, this stuff is a fantastic replacement though. The flavor is great, not exactly the same as meat but still sweet and tangy like hickory smoked jerky should be. The texture is also excellent; not quite as tough as the real thing but close. Its fairly healthy too so I keep a few in my backpack as a quick awesome snack."
"I purchased this as I wanted to give my baby an organic alternative to cereal found in supermarkets. I thought is was such  great idea to have multigrain cereal just like what I eat.<br />BIG MISTAKE.<br />This gave my baby the most horrible gas and it took me months to realize it was the cereal causing this. Only when my mother-in-law said ""Boy, if I eat whole grain cereal in the evening, i act like a trumpet all night"" did I think. ""Waou, maybe it's the cereal"".<br />I've stopped giving her this and no more crying, arching and farting!"
"I decided to purchase Kirkland Organic EVOO based on other reviews, and on a University of California study that lists Kirkland as the least likely to be adulterated with non-EVOO oils. I was surprised and delighted with the flavor and adaptability of Kirkland Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil and will purchase it again. It's a great bargain compared to the other two or three certified oils, and the taste is wonderful. A general note: The plastic container Kirkland Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil is sold in is sturdy and solid, but I choose to re-bottle the oil in glass when I receive it, as I do not to store cooking or salad oils in plastic bottles. I would gladly pay the extra dollar it might cost to purchase the item packaged in glass."
"Warning: it contains food preservatives. Other than that it is fine, but presence of preservatives in dates (!) justifies my low 2 star rating."
"This is a GREAT waffle mix! I have allergies to preservatives and to find food in general that is great tasting without the preservatives is a huge challenge. I have tried several other mixes and this one is by far the best. I totally don't understand the reviews about the bad taste and ""all the chemicals""--read labels of other mixes and you will see this one is not full of all those ingredients. There are certain kinds of ingredients that these mixes need, such as levening, and when you use REAL butter, NOT the ""tub"" butter that contains water and other nasty stuff, these are THE BEST WAFFLES EVER!"
"taste nothing like how cocoa should taste, i'll never touch this again, i'll be trying the swiss miss cocoa maybe better luck"
"I still have some of this; I didn't expect it to have much of a flavor, being so small, but it definitely is nutty. I have this as a snack for my daily fiber! :)"
"I grew up ""doctoring"" my mother's oatmeal with massive amounts of brown sugar. Then breakfast hot cereal makers started adding sweeteners, which at first, seemed OK, but as I grew less needy of the morning sugar fix, they all seemed too sweet. This is a perfect blend of taste and fiber for both my husband and I, who buy it two boxes at a time and always seem to run out. Great for traveling, camping, or using as a ""safe food"" after a bout with the flu or stomach problems."
I am not a fan of flavored coffee and I thought I had read the description of this product very carefully but nowhere did I see any indication that it was a flavored coffee. I wish the descriptions of the coffees offered by Amazon were clearer so that there is no confustion as to what you are purchasing. Even the name of the product is a little deceptive since one might assume that it is Jamaican coffee.
"This is the best dog food I have ever purchased, and having been a dog training for over 4 years, I've purchased A LOT! We first tried this food when our new addition (an 8-week old German Shepherd) joined the family, and we wanted to keep him on a natural dog food. With any purebred dog, health can be an issue, and you don't want to fill your dog with by-products and plant fillers from day one. This food is praised by unbiased pet food reviewers, and I don't understand why there isn't more publicity for this product. Our other dog, a 5-year old English Bulldog with constant skin/allergy issues, was switched over when we discovered this brand, and she has not had an allergic reaction since! We didn't realize how much it had to do with diet. Her hair used to fall out in spring (not just normal shedding, but actual balding from hair loss), but this has alleviated that problem as well. Now our shepherd is a year and a half old, and he's eating this Large Breed Adult Lamb & Rice flavor. He's not a big eater, but he loves this food! Will definitely keep him, and all future pets, on this brand as long as they keep their standards as high as they are now!! Kudos Diamond for making a wonderful natural dog food.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: I would never buy regular Diamond brand food. If the bag doesn't say ""Natural"" on it, the standards they are kept to are WAY lower and the quality suffers immensely. Stick with Natural (it's a couple dollars more at most!) and your dog will be happier and healthier and live a longer life! Isn't that what we all want?!?"
This is very sturdy and not as some reviews were that stated this was flimsy.<br />I have no issues with it at all and would highly recommend it to anyone of my friends.
"My mother gave me one of those old-time, stand up popcorn makers like you see at carnivals or theaters. Even though we enjoyed it, the popcorn never approached the taste of theaters. That is, until I found this stuff.<br /><br />I came across them in an online recommendation and bought a case. We've never looked back. The stuff is delicious and it makes eating popcorn while watching a movie just like going to the theater."
"I live in Florida and according to research I've done, these can grow in this area. I received 8 seeds in a timely fashion. The company provided a page of basic information about seed growing. The seeds themselves had a sentence of instructions which I've followed. I've begun attempting germinating 4 of the 8 seeds with 4 different techniques including soaking for 18 hours, and using a damp paper towel, etc. It is week 4 and the seeds have not germinated yet. I've done research and I can't find any answers. Perhaps they're just duds? If anyone can help, please contact me. I will update this review if I get any new results.<br /><br />Couple of months and no germination. Perhaps I'll have to do more research, but I believe the seeds were just duds."
"I purchased these beans based on other reviews.  My plan was to make a Premium Vanilla Extract for family members.  I purchased a very expensive Vodka, unusual bottles to fill, and waited for my bean order to arrive.  I wasn't happy about the wait.  The beans arrived after the 4th, and I rushed to open the package.  I could not smell the beans as others reported!  Most of the beans were skinny/shriveled, more dry, and a great disappointment.  I Would Not recommend this product.  I will be looking for another source."
"I love these almonds!!  They taste just like a snickerdoodle cookie, but make for a much healthier snack!  One of my favorites of the Blue Diamond Oven Roasted varieties.  Buying them in a 6-pack is more cost-effective for me, especially now that I can't find them in my grocery store. I wish they came in the large resealable bag like some of the other flavors, but for now I'll stick with the 6 container pack."
Newmans makes really good coffee. This seems to be bold smooth but not overpowering. I would recommend anyone to at least try this. Seems like it is one of those coffees that is down the middle of the road.
My dogs can not wait to get this treat everyday.  I think the glucosamine helps my older dog's joints.  If your dog has allergies I would go with the lamb and rice over the other flavors.
"I bought 2 cases (24 cans) of this product from Amazon.com.  Out of the 24 cans, 5 were undented, 10 were badly dented, and 9 were extremely dented with 3 of those being crushed in half.  The crushed cans were in the center of one package of 12.  Each case had 12 cans in it and was wrapped tightly in bubble wrap.  The 2 cases were inside a larger box.  There was no damage to any of the boxes.  Other reviewers of this product have talked about these cans arriving dented in similar fashion to what I experienced but I took a  chance and hoped for the success other reviewers have experienced.  Lady Luck was not on my side.  Fortunately, by googling the product's name I found Farmer's Market Organic Pumpkin at another supplier who sent me a case that only had 2 slightly dented cans and 10 perfect cans for the same price plus nominal shipping.  Amazon.com is a good company and I know they'll refund my money for the case of horribly dented cans that I returned.  However, this issue has been going on for some time as evidenced by the reviews.  Where the problem lies, I do not know but I will not buy this product again from Amazon.com until the dented can issue has been resolved.<br /><br />As to the product itself, the pumpkin is delicious.  It's not solid like Libby's pumpkin, but it works well for my recipes.  It has the consistency of baby food and is slightly more yellow than Libby's pumpkin.  There is a recipe on the can for pumpkin pie using condensed sweetened milk.  I prefer Libby's recipe so instead of 14 oz. of condensed sweetened milk, I use 12 oz. of evaporated milk and 1/2 c. of sugar because we like it less sweet.  The product I can recommend and would've given it 5 stars for the pumpkin alone, but the ongoing, horribly dented can issue lost it 4 points.  The dents really are that bad and some are so badly dented that if they can be opened, they may represent a health hazard.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Amazon.com is a great company.  It refunded my money for the badly dented cans.  Today, I also received my second order from another online company and while it had fewer dented cans in it, the badly/severely dented cans were in the middle of the 12-pack case just like they were in the 2 cases I had ordered from Amazon.com.  The problem seems to lie with the manufacturer.  I've emailed  Farmer's Market Foods, Inc., twice but have heard nothing from the company.  I won't be buying this product again.  Over 50% of the 48 cans had bad to severe dents, of which at least 3 were crushed almost in half.  Badly dented cans may be unsafe to use (e.g., botulism, bacteria).  The tops and bottoms may seem fine (unswollen) at first, but if the seal is microscopically breached, it may not be fine months from now.  So, when it comes to this product and the company's continued shipping of badly dented and crushed cans in the middle of the case, all I can say is:  ""caveat emptor."""
"I bought this tea after reading all of the positive reviews. I have long enjoyed Lipton's Caramel Vanilla Truffle tea and read that this tea was better, so I gave it a try. It smells awesome when steeping, but that is when the positives stopped. It seriously tastes like a thinner version of cheap pancake syrup. There is no vanilla flavor whatsoever, just a strong butter aftertaste. If you haven't tried this tea before don't buy the 6 pack - get a single box. I understand that different people have different tastes, so know what you are getting into before you commit to 6 boxes."
"The label says they're popped, rather than fried or baked.  However they did it, these are great chips!  They're very nicely seasoned such that I don't think you'd be inclined to dip them, though they're certainly sturdy enough to.  The flavor is a nice balance sweet and salty with not too much of either. At 100 calories a bag, 3 grams of fat (no saturated, no trans fat), 16g carbohydrates and 230mg sodium per bag they're also great nutritionally.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of sweet potatoes, but in this form they are terrific!  All five of us in this house from age 9 to 50-something are fans.<br /><br />I wish I was better at describing flavors but you'll just need to try them for yourself."
"I know this is a weird review, but the fact that I noticed it enough to write about it means I'm not making it up. I just went through a Costco sized box of Tully's bold, and that was great. So I decided to try this box. The main thing I noticed is that I have to scrub the hell out of my mouth and tongue after drinking it, because the flavor really, really stays around. I never noticed having to do this with Tully's. It's a gross, smoky taste. It's like having smoker's breath without smoking.<br /><br />Can't wait to finish this box..."
"This review is about Musselmans apple cider purchased at Walmart.  This cider has the same poor taste that I experienced with Whitehouse apple juice last year.  In the case of the Whitehouse brand I found that, despite the proudly displayed American flag on the label, the juice was actually from China.  I would bet $10 that the Musselmans juice is from China despite the label saying otherwise.  I remember having great tasting cider when I was a kid in Pennsylvania. Doesn't seem to exist anymore."
"I bought this at a local gas station near my house and was excited to try it because I see it everywhere. It was nasty. I will never drink this crap again, I don't care how ""good"" it is for you. The taste is disgusting and I'd rather just drink regular water. Blah!"
"This tastes like carbonated orange juice, very tart.  It is very expensive compared to easier-to-find similar beverages.  If one had allergies or health issues, it might be worth drinking."
My golden retriever absolutely loves his tug a jug! It gives him a fun challenge while trying to get his food out of there and it keeps him occupied for a while. It is a great design! I want to get another one for him.
"This is a good tea that has a nice flavor. My only complaint is that for a rich tea, you have to use extra tea bags. This is sold in bulk which helps off set the price for using more tea bags."
"I am a creature of habit, and when I purchased my Keurig, I tasted alot of the coffee brands and flavors made for my appliance.  However, I never found one that I said ""this could replace the coffee I am currently using"".  So when I discovered the disposable K-cups I was delighted.  The problem now was I did not purchase enough.  So now I am waiting on my second delivery.  Great service."
I've heard over and over that people are having a difficult time finding a hot chocolate pod to enjoy in their Keurig K-cup brewers.  The search is over!  This Grove Square Hot Cocoa received four big smiles from my sons. They just went on and on about how delicious it was!  I love having this new coffee pot where it's fast and convenient for all of us!  Super happy with this purchase.
"I bought this product to get rid of black ants in my house. It did not help at all. I even tried mixing it with sugar and placing it where the ants used to go, well they just don't go anywhere close to it, it really looks like it repels the ants, instead of attracting them. I have not found yet a product that work for my ants, except the spray that kills them instantly (but I cannot spray it in the kitchen, and I have ants all around the counter top, even if it is cleaned to perfection)."
The dog really loved these bones and it seemed to freshen her breath.  It was a good treat for a dog with tummy troubles.
"I accidentally left my lunch in my car when I went to work one day and it went bad.  Unfortunately I didn't have time to go out to pick up lunch, so I turned to the vending machine.  Luckily, a Hormel Beef Steak and Peppers was available!  It did its job, it filled me.  However, it was disgusting.  It was a globby, mushy, brown mess.  I did not taste like beef and peppers.  It was more like a beef gravy that was put over way overcooked noodles.  But, like an earlier poster said, it's GREAT for dieters!  I often eat Healthy Choice Fresh Mixers.  Usually they're pretty tasty, but they're very tiny.  The Hormel meal was only 210 calorie and significantly more filling than the Healthy Choice one."
This is very good and tastes great with strawberries.  It is just like having chocolate dipped strawberries without all the calories.
One of the richer coffee for k cups! We typically grind our own even for the Keurig but the Mahagoney from Caribou is a great alternative. Order was shipped very quickly.  Will definitely buy again.
"My daughter loves Gobble Gobble.  I was a little surprised to see the reviews that said it is dry and tastes bad.  I wonder if those were bad packets.  The ones we've had have always been moist.  The food is a little bit bland, but it is not recommended to feed babies salt or spices, so it's about what I'd expect.  I like this better than the Chick Chick because it has a firmer texture.  To me, the Chick Chick is runny.  I normally spoon feed this to our baby, but if I don't mind cleaning up a mess I sometimes allow her to eat it with her hands.  We've never had any problems with gagging or choking.  When the packet is empty she's still looking for more.  I make most of my daughter's baby food and am very particular about what packaged foods I give to her.  I feel okay about this one because there are no weird preservatives and I can identify all of the ingredients."
"Good choice for your morning coffee if you like a medium, slightly bold flavor.  Vienna coffee is not a real bold coffee, so medium roast coffee drinkers should like the flavor.<br /><br />Vienna Coffee House has less of a kick than <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VXFL1Q"">Wolfgang Puck French Roast (Dark Roast), 24-Count K-cups (Pack of 2)</a>), but a little more than <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CHFUDC"">Coffee People Donut Shop Medium Roast, Extra Bold for Keurig Brewers, 24-Count K-Cups (Pack of 2)</a>.<br /><br />Good flavor, slightly sweet with a good bean taste that isn't tough on your stomach.<br /><br />To the manufacturer: please revise your coffee descriptions - they are terrible and give the consumer no information on the flavor/style of coffee featured.  If you want us to buy the coffee, be forthright on your descriptions."
My two papillons absolutely love Instinct dry dog food.  Grain free and high in protein and all natural ingredients.  How can you go wrong?<br /><br />I rotate my dogs among the different varieties.
"is tasty chai tea.  also good for camping, because you only have to add water to the mix.  I was buying this for 8.99 for the 12oz packages (i think that's what the baggies weigh), but this is much better deal, 2 1.9lb cans for 20 bucks, free shipping.  thanks!"
"We love to make Hummus, and love to make sandwitches, salad dressings. One of our kids favorite foods is Tahini over cold Undon Noodles."
"As the title says I'm not a fan of fizzy water and that taste definitely comes through in this drink. The 'tang' of this product assaults your mouth right from the first sip.  It smelled nice. But really it was just so sweet and carbonated that the experience was not enjoyable.  There no discernable taste of kiwi or strawberry, just a blast of sugar and bubbles. The 3 people under 11 in our familiy loved it but - as we knew they would.<br /><br />No thanks."
It had a horrable after taste the first time I had it was ok the next it was worst than the first time I had it and the 3rd time I could not eat the sandwich.It has verry bitter taste
I was realy impressed with these they do not taste like the old GF crackers I have bought before. They are actualy good and does remind me of wheat crackers like I use to eat. Thank you Amazon.
This product smells so bad that I couldn't even try to consume it.  It smells sour and rancid and is detectable even before the package was opened.  The seller has a no return policy so I'm out the $ I spent on this as it will go right into the garbage.
"Yummy, mild, and delicious. My new favorite! Mild in comparision to coffees called ""rocket fuel"" and taste like motor oil, but truly a medium roast. Pleasant in the morning. Makes you glad to have a good cup of coffee."
"This coffee is for those of you who like smooth, light roast coffee.  If you don't care for light roast, this coffee is not for you."
"Like many others, we were on the fence about buying these Popchips, with the possibility of being stuck with 24 bags of chips that even the dogs may not eat.  Turns out though we enjoy them all, the kids like the plain ones, saying they taste like Pringles, and my wife and I are particularly fond of the cracked pepper and salt.  We are not fans of BBQ chips in general, but still ate the BBQ Popchips.<br /><br />I will definitely be buying these again"
"Heard about this drink from a friend and had to try it. Had one while traveling and loved it!!! I sat on the plane enjoying it...I was thinking, I should bought another one!"
"Haribo's gummi strawberries are some of the tastiest candy available. I may be biased because I've loved gummi candies (ESPECIALLY those from Haribo) for pretty much my entire life. There's just something about the perfect combination of texture and bite that make chowing down on chewy fruit-flavored candy a happy activity.<br /><br />Strawberries are one of my favorite fruits so naturally I was overjoyed when I found out many years ago that Haribo made a gummi strawberry candy that, as a bonus, even looked like the fruit it was trying to imitate! They obviously don't taste like actual strawberries which have a sort of tartiness to them, but they do taste as good as if not better than any other imitation strawberry flavor out there.<br /><br />These candies are so good I can just munch on them - two or three at a time - for hours (which I guiltily admit I have done in the past at work). The price can't be beaten, either - believe me, I've looked high and low for a candy specialist that can sell this much sweet goodness at this low a price!<br /><br />And my family loves them as well. My two young boys can't get enough of them, and even my wife who doesn't really like gummi candy all that much can put down a dozen or so pieces.<br /><br />If you like strawberry flavored candy and love gummis, I highly recommend you try this (or even a smaller package if 5 lbs. scares you) - you won't be disappointed!"
"i've never written an amazon review before, but this product was so horrible i had to warn would be buyers; i can eat pretty much anything, but i had to empty out both bottles... it just tasted like colored sugar water (very thin), sickening sweet.. don't know if there was any onion flavoring.. the only reason i bought this is because i couldn't get ken's steakhouse vidalia onion dressing shipped in California.  So far, the worst product i have purchased on amazon.  Buyer beware, unless you like sugar water, then ""drink up""..blech."
"I was hoping for the gift box, instead I got a cardboard box full of a mixed bag of K cups.  Don't get me wrong, if the price is right then I have no problem, but the price was a little misleading.  I was under the impression that this would be in a sampler box, not a warehouse box.  It looks like a mix and match of K Cups that fell out of other packages or were returned. Buyer beware."
"These bars are great, this was my second order and the second box seems to be more stale.  The first box contained bars that were so fresh and soft and this second box contains bars that are not as white, soft or fresh.  They have a later expiration date but the products are not as fresh."
"These popchips(original flavor)are great tasting, low in fat, and a snack that is satisfying. With free shipping and handling with amazon prime they are now at a price I will order and reorder.  With my son's food allergies I am so happy they contain all allowable ingredients!!  Thanks Amazon."
"I have been feeding these to our dog for years to help her with her joints, especially her hips. Ever since I started her on these as a treat, meaning I gave her one in the morning and another in the evening she regained her active self and they helped her get interested in her regular meals. It was a win, win situation for our finicky eater.<br /><br />However, I would like to note, that when I started her on these treats, they were being made in the USA. Resentfully I discovered that they are now produced in China. As we know, China produces some very high end products and some real crap as well. However, when it comes to food products that come from overseas a warning flag goes up in my mind, especially if they are coming from China. Personally I never noticed anything odd with our 14 year old dog's reaction to Happy Hips. Still, I decided that I did not want to subject her to a food product coming out of China.<br /><br />Does anyone know of another product like Happy Hips with Glucosamine (for the joints) in it, that is produced in the USA?"
"First, the product pictured is not what you get.<br /><br />What you really get is are tiny packets called ""sticks"" suitable for flavoring bottled water. The box doesn't even say what size bottle it is sized for.<br /><br />I'm not keeping it so I can't tell you how it tastes."
Don't the sellers read these reviews and say something to the manufacturer. It is a terrible that Amazon can sell this product to the public.
"A friend brought me this from Argentina and my kids and I ate it with a spoon and then apples so that I would feel less guilty. When we finished, I immediately panicked because I wasn't sure if I could get it here in the U.S. Low and behold I found it on Amazon. It is different packaging but same company so I assume it is just catering to Americans. Delicious!"
Nothing easier. Nothing better. Even beats grandmother's white gravy recipe. Already peppered for you. You do nothing but mix it with water. Takes only a minute or two. I highly recommend this gravy mix. It will not disappoint.
"This has to be without a doubt the WORST tasting Hot Chocolate ever! The best way to describe the taste of ""This Stuff"" is really cheap suger free instant hot chocolate. Swiss Miss instant is way better and cost less. After only 3 cups threw the rest in the garbage where it belongs and canceled my subscribe and save for this ""SLOP""!"
"My dog Denali loves the Ziwi Peak food.  It is all meat and we supplement with a little people food and snacks but there is no filler and no byproducts and she eats less volume.<br /><br />It was not available in this area, even though the local specialty store Paw Prince gave us samples and carries the snacks made by Ziwi Peak.<br /><br />I will continue to purchase this product from Amazon."
"My husband and I went Gluten Free earlier this year due to a health condition.  We stumbled across this product at Whole Foods and decided to try it.  These were incredible...  so cheesy and spicy!!!  So much so, we decided to buy a case on Amazon.  Once our original case was depleted, we re-ordered, and though the product looks identical, the new case contained cheese curls with little to no seasoning.  They were so bland that we had no desire to eat them.  We opened each bag in the case hoping some of them would be good like the first case we purchased, but to our dismay, we ended up tossing the entire case.  We will not be buying these again.  What a letdown..."
"I used to grow the Japanese hulless in small quantities for my stovetop popper. This is the closest I can find. If you are appalled by the shipping cost, like I was, try looking elsewhere for a better deal. For instance, one popular site offers 6 lbs for $11.95 with FREE shipping if you sign up for repeating shipments (which you can cancel any time). Try www.c**king.com."
You have to put a lot of sugar in  this to make it taste good. The coffee just by itself kind if has a stinky smell like a poopy diaper or a pee pee poo poo puppy in a cup. Next time I am going for raspberry flavored coffee...cause the chocolate is like poop. YUCK.
"This is a wonderful product at a wonderful price!  Great tasting and the size is just big enough but not too bulk.  Also, I appreciate that they ship to APO/FPO addresses."
My husband tried this coffee while we we visiting relatives and just kept raving about it because it did not have any of the bitterness associated with coffee. We were able to pick up the Keurig coffee maker for a great price and order this quantity from Amazon.
And a great price from amazon. My wife and I had dinner last night at a very high end restaurant and while everything was magnificent we both thought the coffee wasn't as good as our Yuban. I often wonder about Starbucks whose coffee I find undrinkable. My son says it's an acquired taste.
"I had to review this toy because it is one of VERY few that has not been destroyed within days (sometimes minutes).  Very good durability - the rattling of treats in the jar and the difficulty of getting to them perplexed my golden mix.  She likes this toy, but still prefers her treat-dispensing ball as she has become a master at rolling it to extract the treats.  I give the product 4.5 stars (but I rounded up) for standing up to the first two days of her chewing and trying to get the treats out without solving the puzzle.  It loses a half star because she generally gets disinterested after a few minutes of not being able to get treats out.  She does like to carry it around though!  Great toy overall!"
"I received these today (4/13/2010) and they are not individually wrapped. I received two gallon type bags, each with 36 raw beef sticks in them. Amazon issued refund which I'm grateful for but I'm still very disappointed with product."
"I received my white peppercorns today. I was very happy with them. They were sealed in an airtight plastic bag. And the shipping package was secure so as not to damage the products. When I opened the bag the smell of the peppercorns was amazing. They were all whole(none broken). I can't wait to cook with them. I use white pepper in potatoes,salads of any kind; just about anything you'd use regular pepper on. The white pepper adds a buttery taste to all foods."
"We've been buying happy hips for a while - online and at stores. I feel that if I'm going to give my dog a treat, one that's closest to something ""healthy"" should be it. My dogs LOOOOOOVE them, I think it's their fav. Treat by far. I'm subscribed to Amazon's delivery so you do get them for a little less money and you don't have to think about going online and buying them, you will automatically get them. I love that feature - would recommend using it if you buy these regularly."
I don't understand why this is priced so high.  You can get it from Walmart online for about $10.00 (this includes shipping & handling) The product itself is great. I like the fact that I can control how much flavor I get by adjusting the amount of powder I use.  Basically the product is 5 stars & the cost is 1 star.
"Kamfen Noodle King -Beef flavored soup. This noodle soup comes in a carton waxed paper bowl. Included are noodles, and three flavor packets. You add boiling water after you add the packets of dehydrated vegetables, spices, and a paste of some sort.<br />  The noodles were starchy, and there was little or no vegetable flavor. The beef taste was probaly beef bullion cubes. All in all, a soup with very little flavor and my guess, high in sodium.<br />  There are much, much better ramen noodle soups available. You can cross this one off your list."
"All this is, is artificially sweetened hot cocoa mix that is placed in a Kcup delivery device.  What a waste of money.  Also, Grove Square products are notoriously inferior."
"Pros: not overly sweet like some juice drinks<br />  no caffeine<br />  no corn sweeteners (if that matters to you)<br />Cons:  expensive for the size (8.3 ounces)<br />  can't taste the orange or tangerine juices in it<br />  lots of calories<br /><br />I grew up eating oranges and tangerines off my grandparents' trees.  I was surprised that I couldn't taste those flavors in this drink, but then I looked at the ingredient list on the can and those were the juices that were used in the smallest amounts - probably to keep the cost down.<br /><br />I'll stick to the Sobe low-cal drinks and the 10 calorie Vitamin Water because 1 - they are cheaper and  2 - I'd rather save up my daily allotment of calories for something with more flavor."
"Packaging was fine but the baby food were rotten. However, Amazon.com does not let me return it. This is not right!!!! I have put the pic of the food on packaging review page. Buyers should all take a look at it."
"I like the ease of this mix. I haven't tried anything but pancakes. They were great! I did add cottage cheese to my mix to add protein, which made them less fluffy but not less tasty. I can't wait to try this mix for chicken. I really miss fried chicken."
"As others have noted, these treats are made in China as clearly stated on the bag. I didn't like that, but the news gets worse.<br /><br />On the back of the bag is a statement: ""Not for human consumption. Wash hands with soap and water after handling.""<br /><br />If I have to wash my hands after handling these things, I'm sure as hell not going to feed them to my Yorkies!<br /><br />As expected, Amazon graciously accepted a return."
"This new recipe is horrible! It is watery, almost like a stage 1 meal, and it went from 4g of protein to 1g.  Most of the veggie pouches have more protein!  Definitely not worth the purchase."
I can't believe that I got 5 whole pounds of this sour and old-tasting coffee.I might as well have bought a store brand of coffee!
My husband complained that split peas didn't have any taste anymore.  He really likes these and said they taste like split peas used to taste.  Seem to be very good quality.
"I wouldn't say my twins are picky eater, but they wouldn't eat this one.  They eat just about every Gerber's organics."
Good news...puppy dog loves it...<br />bad...she will not eat anything else.<br />Now she's hooked...she will not eat dry food.<br />But she's more than worth it!!!
"This product produces excellent (outstanding) Belgian waffles in my Waring Pro waffle iron.  They exceed anything you may buy in a restaurant.  Truly!  However, at $5 per box, the cost of the other ingredients you must add, time to prepare, and the small amount of product in the box, I suggest you look at other gluten-free products from Pamela's, The Gluten Free Pantry, Bob's Red Mill, or Arrowhead Mills.  You may see a better value for your food dollars.  Incidentally, Arrowhead Mills products are equally as tasty and easy to prepare, but I believe you are getting more product in the bag.  Feeding a family of 4 would be a crap shoot at best with a single box of this product.<br /><br />If the manufacturer were to repackage the product with more content per box and drop the price, I would have given it 5 stars. Safeway was the first store in San Francisco to offer this product and placed it in the center of its baking products.  Now, however, it has fallen to lowest shelf level with some prices sold by higher end grocers approaching $6 per box.  Forget it at those prices.  Hey, it's largely ultra fine white rice flour and super fine sugar!<br /><br />Bisquick would also benefit from a buckwheat GF product in its inventory.  I would certainly buy it."
"This soup lacks the key ingredients that make a canned clam chowder great: Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (soy/cottonseed), dehydrated potatoes, modified starches of all kinds, hydrolyzed corn gluten, MSG, potassium chloride, sodium phosphate, disodium inosinate, disodium guanylate, and succinic acid. What good is a classic New England clam chowder without these classic ingredients?<br /><br />Instead, the first ingredient listed is: Clams. Next you'll be telling me it's got butter in it (it does? Oh.).<br /><br />On a more serious note. Bar Harbor makes a good tasting clam chowder. The first list of ingredients came from Snow's and Campbell's condensed New England clam chowders. This Bar Harbor stuff is worth it."
"Even though this item is listed under the Gluten free category, it is not.  The ingredients state that it contains wheat protein.  Do not order this if you need GF food.  Bad reviewing by Amazon!"
"The problem with this peanut butter is the use of ""evaporated cane juice"" which is a coy way of saying ""raw sugar"". Accent--on the SUGAR. The sugar is gritty and overpowers the peanut taste and the maple. It wasn't very maple-y. It was gritty, sweet and pretty much not great. Maybe the ""cane juice"" crystallized to the low moisture content of peanut butter. Anyway, it was a loser.<br /><br />I had heard much hype about this peanut butter, started by someone who has a peanut butter sandwich restaurant in New York. I happen to like PBJ and celery with pb--a tablespoon of peanut butter is a fairly good snack even if you are watching your food intake but this peanut butter is too sugary for my tastes. I gave it two stars--if you are making a confection or cookies, it could be very good, but as eat-alone peanut butter, I found it way too sweet and gritty for my tastes."
"We tried this formula because it is lactose free, my baby does not have any other issues, just lactose intolerant.<br />We found that it smells bad, does not mix well into water and my baby would not drink a drop."
"The first ingredient is vinegar. Anyone who uses hot sauce religiously should understand what that means. I read the other reviews and was expecting a hell of a lot more than what I got. It's got a good flavor to it, but it's just a few steps above tabasco. From what the other reviewers described, it seems this product has a LOT of variability in heat, which means it's going to have a lot of variability in quality. The bottle I got is really tame, far, far below my Dave's Ghost Pepper, Dave's Ultimate Insanity, Blair's After Death, Da Bomb Beyond Insanity, Da Bomb Ground Zero, Professor Phardtpounder's Colon Cleanser, it's a lacking sauce. Hell, Sriracha is hotter than this. If you get lucky and get a hot bottle, congrats. I use mine liberally on cheap pizza, because that's all it's good for."
I prefer jerky with a dry texture but always have a hard time finding a good one.  They're usually moistened soft chunks of meat instead of hard strips.  If you like old-school jerky then I highly recommend this product.  Delicious!
"On a whim, I picked up a two-pack of Stonewall Kitchen Farmhouse Pancake and Waffle Mix recently, enticed in some measure by the already positive reviews here--and I will add to those by noting that we will be keeping a supply on hand in our pantry.<br /><br />I really did not expect that this easy-to-prepare mix would yield waffles better than the from-scratch recipes I had been using, but now the waffle iron is stashed within easy reach after being banished to the recesses of the cabinets for the last few years.<br /><br />Being able to whip out crisp, airy, light, malty waffles does wonders for one's popularity in the kitchen, and pairing these with real maple syrup and fresh blueberries is the way to go."
These are delicious lower sodium/fat chips. Convenient lunch/snack size bag is enough for sharing. Halloween is two months away and the kids will be getting these for trick or treating at our house.  By the case means they're always on hand.
"this is very good it comes with a seasoning packet you can add(chicken) and it is really good. the directions are for the entire bag and makes between 3 and 4 cups.(you add 2 cups water bring to boil and then simmer 45 minuets, although i did not time it) the one drawback is it has that one grain that bursts when you cook it and if you look to close and have never seen this before you might think that cooking it some how made ""worms"" grow out of it.  i was grossing my self out, mixing it in my bowl trying too make it cool enough to eat. this would probably be really good mixed in to a bread recipe seasoned or other wise.  It does not taste like the Kasai one."
"Learning that we Americans have an imbalance of omega3 vs. omega6, I was glad to find something to correct the imbalance without putting in too much effort. Chia doesn't taste like anything. Just looks like mini dinosaur eggs! I use two tablespoons of chia in a large cup of water with matcha and a little bit of crystal light. It's fun to drink it when the seeds bloat like tomato seeds!"
"I ordered several kinds of highly-rated popcorn from Amazon at one time.  I admit I was skeptical of some of the rave reviews.  Well the Snappy white popcorn arrived first so I tried it immediately.  I actually measured (I usually just eye-ball it) 3 T canola oil, 1/3 cup Snappy popcorn and 1/3 tsp Flavacol flavored salt.  I put the oil and Flavacol in my trusty Whirly-pop popper and swirled to distribute the Flavacol.  I then added the popcorn.  It popped REALLY quickly, snowy white and fluffy.  It was divine.  Tender, not greasy or chewy and so flavorful.  I will update this post when I try the other brands I ordered to let you know how it stacks up.  Oh, and I had ONE kernel that didn't pop!"
"Wow, good tasting and creamy just like the 'real' thing.<br /><br />The pistachio and other flavors as cheesecake and banana cream and butterscotch are surprisingly satisfying while being sugar-free/fat-free. The chocolate flavors are good, too, but don't dissolve/set as well as this does. Very easy to prepare -- and ready to eat in minutes."
"I ordered this because I have had the Donut Shop coffee before and really enjoyed it and wanted to taste some of the other flavors they offered.  After receiving my order of the ""sampler"" pack, I was very disappointed! Over half my order was decaf coffee and I only got 2 cups of the flavored coffee; which was the main reason I ordered it.  I love this coffee but am disappointed in the so called sampler pack or ""the lack of variety"" pack!"
"This coffee is perfect for those who don't like strong coffee shop coffee.  It's mild yet has a bold flavor.  I actually make two cups with each k-cup.  That helps me save lots of money and works perfectly when I want more than one cup in the morning.  Second cup is lighter, but it still has good flavor."
"These pop chips are satisfying and good for a snack, but not what I expected.  They do not taste as good, crisp or as light as the Weight Watchers brand that is so hard to find in stock.  I wish Amazon could carry the actual Weight Watcher's Brand chips - They are the best snack out there."
"I find the texture of this, and most other brown rice pastas, to be really off-putting. There are much better alternative-grain pastas available, like quinoa."
Use as a rub or mix in with canned salmon and mayo for a fast tasty dip.  Great stuff.
I was going through about 2 litres per day of various soda drinks.  Switching to this has really brought down my caloric intake and I have dropped about 5kg with this being the only change in my diet.
"This is a good idea in theory, especially for those like me that prefer healthy salty snacks. Unfortunately, as much as I wanted to like these, they didn't taste like food - hard to describe, but the 'primal' branding doesn't help as I did feel like I was eating something I wasn't supposed to.<br /><br />While the first one I tried was novel, I easily tired of them and then plain got grossed out by them. I won't be getting these again."
i had a terrible cold and a patient of mine had given me a yogi tea for colds --- took me days before i tried it and when i did i absolutely loved it! so i went on their website and found a whole array of teas they offer. i didn't have an idea where to find it first so i checked out whole foods just because i know that the tea is organic and we all know that whole foods only sells organic stuff. i bought a box of triple echinacea for more than $4! i didn't care at that time for the price but as i googled this tea i found out great websites where i could order this from and lo and behold i just subscribed to amazon's auto-delivery. although now i only drink this particular one twice a day --- one in the morning and one before i go to bed --- not only it supports my immune system but it also warms my tummy in the morning! i highly recommend this tea to anyone who is a tea drinker and even for those who have not tried it...it has a wonderful aroma and its very soothing to the throat as well...
"I love these trays!<br /><br />Yes, they're expensive... but worth it to me.<br /><br />They stack VERY neatly in the freezer, the lids seal tightly and keep everything fresh, and the food is easily removed for use (or, storage in a baggie so I can use the same tray again for more food).<br /><br />If you have any trouble getting the food cubes out just leave the lid on and run the bottom under a little warm water... the cubes will slide right out.  :)"
"I have the larger version of this item, and am now buying this one.  I like it, but the larger version is just too big for my crowded refrigerator.  I've had other sprouters in the past, and this one is as good or better than any I've tried.  (Skip quinona (sp?) seeds, however.  They were my one disaster)."
The coffee came quickly and in perfect condition. Good seller. We mix this coffee with regular coffee to scale back our caffeine intake.All decaf coffee gives my husband a headache. This one doesn't so it seems to be working. And it tastes good with our other coffee.
"Ok,lets start of by saying that my microwave is not very good for popcorn,but in my local grocery store I can buy Market Pantry popcorn for $ 4.25 for 18 large bags and not all the pop corn kernels pop but very yummy,and I went through 2 boxes in less than a month,but then we have this one Pop Secret and my first 3 bags BURNT  and was not happy so I decided not to follow the instructions,so I decided to put microwave at 3 minutes and let it stop when it got to 20 sec's,ok so it didn't burnt it,but due to me not placing it microwave on high,it took a very long time to cook it,and so anyway's it began to pop,and so I thought great,at least no burnt popcorn,and I was so excited and HUNGRY to try it,due to the ratings on this site,I began to eat it,and my first reaction was,oh my good ness,DRY DRY ,where is the butter ?..its called butter pop corn so where is the BUTTER ? did it get all dryed up in microwave ?"
"I ordered three different kinds of Yogi tea based on the great reviews -- lemon ginger, stomach ease, and green tea super antioxident. Unfortunately, they all taste exactly the same -- like licorice. If you like licorice flavor, you'll like this tea. If you're looking for something that actually tastes like lemon and ginger, look elsewhere."
"As soon as I opened the teabag envelope, the smell was truly Divine Nasal Candy :-).  As good as the bag and the lingering scent on the envelope smelled, the tea proved to be rather bitter.  I may have steeped it too long, so will see if the bitterness abates steeping less.  However, as I prefer milk or cream products in flower teas, the bitterness was soon dispelled with a little soy creamer and an enjoyable cup was had.  Lychee is truly a wonderful flavor for tea.  I suspect the flowers added to this lychee tea may contribute to the bitterness in the straight tea.  Will definitely reorder."
"Switched to Canidae from ScienceDiet after reading about dog foods on the internet.  I haven't noticed any major differences in the dogs habits or frequencies, other than her eating habits.  Before, she acted very finicky and sometimes would take all day to finish one bowl of food.  Now, she eats the whole helping in less than 30 seconds.  She really seems to like this food.  I will be sticking to this brand it looks like."
"Some of these ""healthy"" snack products taste like the box they come in.  ""SoyJoy"" comes to mind.  Ick.<br /><br />However, Pamela's gluten-free oat chocolate chip coconut ""bars"" are quite tasty and satisfying.  The cover of the box lists it as wheat-free, gluten-free, non-dairy, with 180 mg of Omega-3 fatty acids, 9 grams of whole grains, and no trans fat.  In small print on the side we also find that this company donates to celiac sprue and autism organizations.<br /><br />And it is indeed, as the box also claims, ""moist and chewy.""  The major downer about the product is merely its consistency, as it comes out of its packet as some kind of misshapen, ill-defined lump rather than a literal ""bar,"" and as such it doesn't hold together very well, but that's nitpicking.  Just eat it while it's still in the wrapper and there's no mess.<br /><br />Ingredients include gluten-free oats, rice flour, organic chocolate chunks, coconut sugar, organic eggs, & almonds.  Well worth a try if this description appeals to you.  Enjoy!"
"These are great tasting dog treats but I don't like to spoil my puppies too much and would have preferred smaller pieces even for our Corgi. Our other puppy is about half his size. They are the hardest puppy treats we have tried so breaking them into smaller pieces isn't a simple task even for a man's hands. I was worried how tough they would be for our puppies to chew but they didn't complain. In fact, they took a bit more time and didn't inhale them which is a good thing!<br /><br />Another Newman's Own quality product."
"I researched all the medium priced good quality foods made of lamb and rice and this was the only product that actually had real lamb as the first product followed by lamb meal, then has rice, carrots, peas, eggs, etc.  Only nonfood items are the required minerals to balance diet and taurine and glucosmine.  More natural than the natural products.  Couldn't ask for more.  Plus comes in 35# bags not just small.  Definitelt recommend."
Tried these the other day because of the low price and regreted it from the moment the jar was opened. These sausages tasted like card board soaked in beef flavored vinegar. Im used to eating Glazier's pickled sausages that snap when you bite them. Guess I will stick to what I like.
"Both entrees were popular at my house, with all my furkids except ""Mr. Picky!""  This product line should also be popular with humans, because it has a pleasant odor, and it looks like ""people food,"" as the box says.  If you're concerned about issues such as ""gluten free,"" it's that, too.<br /><br />I did feel that the ""Chicken Pot Pie Entree"" had a lot of liquid in proportion to the amount of solids, especially for the price.  About half the can is broth.  Kitties who prefer minced meals would probably not like this."
"These are fun little shapes for kids.  We love them and they work great for our GFCF diet, however, they do fall apart quite easily - and that's with cooking them just until done.  Unlike traditional pasta, they are not the greatest when they are ""leftovers"" because they lose a lot of moisture and harden.  Overall, a pretty good product and we are happy to have them so that we don't miss out on pasta simply because we do not eat gluten."
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002YJ0118"">Case (24) of 2.5 Ounce Great Northern Popcorn Portion Packs</a><br />I bought a popcorn maker and this popcorn, it is YUMMY!!! I will totally buy it again."
"We were shocked to find out that Dogswell a company we have been buying our dog treats for last several years have started outsourcing these dog treats to China. This is very disappointing considering 4-5 years ago when many pets in the US died due to food poisoning resulted from pet food packed in China.<br /><br />It is very surprising why this product got around 4/5 rating. I am assuming either  many buyers, like us, did not read where this is manufactured as the text ""Made in China"" is written in small alphabets and hidden in other text behind the cover OR most of these reviews in 2010 and 2011 look suspiciously 'fixed'...notice how many of them got 1 out of 1 likes.<br /><br />We have stopped feeding our dog this food out of legitimate concern.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Feb 2012: Just to update that our dog died recently after diagnosed suffering from Hemolytic Anemia and Diabetes. We fed our dog these treats for number of years and now wonder just how much they contributed to her illness considering these treats are NOT made in USA but China."
I bought 4 packets and planted one of them.  It only took a couple of days for the sprouts.  My cats love it!
"The product is of excellent quality and of great taste and is imported from India. Unlike most of the items available in  Amazon.com, this one is overtly priced @$23.99 when you can get it only at $8.99 in local grocery shops."
This is one of the best gluten-free things I've tried -<br />I'm just sad that it's currently out of stock - bring it back!
"My cats go crazy for the Party Mix and mainly the cheese flavor. It sells for $1.50<br />to $1.89 a pouch in my local stores, so I was looking on amazon hoping to find a better<br />price. I looked at this listing because of the price of $6.48, assuming it was for several<br />pouches, like most of the other listings here. But no number of pouches was listed and the<br />only indication comes from looking at the shipping weight: this ia apparently the price<br />for a single pouch. This is a problem with amazon--quantities are not always posted<br />and you can really get ripped off overpaying. I saw one review for Friskies canned<br />food, where the reviewer thought she was ordering a multican pack for $12 but the<br />actual number was not posted and she ended up receiving ONE can!"
"Only once before have I tasted a better chocolate covered coconut macaroon, and that was long ago and far away.  The dark chocolate is lucious and it's very addicting."
"At my local market, they sell this fragrant, nutty, excellent tea for $1.99 a box! $4.99 a box is highway robbery! Shop around!"
"I was so excited to get my whole wheat pizza dough.  After ordering it, I got it two days later!  The directions are easy to follow and the taste of the crust is phenomenal.  The toppings I added to my pizza were shrimp, chicken, cherry tomatoes, Mexican cheese blend, and turkey Canadian bacon.  The pizza turned out great! Only 8 Weight Watcher's Point Plus value per slice.  This is a better alternative to other leading pizzas."
"I must say that Melissa's soyrizo is the best I have ever tasted.  Even my kids love it! It is so much better than the real stuff that is greasy and full of fat.  I mix it with egg whites and put it in a tortilla and it is delicious. Takes a minute to heat it up in the skillet, then add the eggs and it's ready!  Doesn't get any better thank that.  Thanks Melissa's for such a great product!"
"All of the Roland products are top quality.  Roland's caviar is the real deal, unlike some other brands that are really made from seaweed!"
"This is great for a quick, easy, versatile dessert when you don't want to heat up the oven. Although it doesn't taste exactly like cheesecake, it's a pretty good cheesecake-like dessert for the price. I like to make the mini-cheesecakes suggested on the box and top them with fruit. One note of caution: Amazon's cost per box is a little high. In this pack of 12, each box of mix costs about $2.30, but a box costs around $1.80 in my local Target. So, I recommend this product, and I suggest buying it at a local store."
"As other reviewers noted, more than dozen of items were broken, so the box was sticky and some of them still had creamer on them. Also the expiration date is June 2010 which less than 6 months away, I wont be able to use them before the sell by date."
"First the delivery service was great and arrived a few days before the estimated time. The package was in good condition and my children liked the taste. I think it is one of the best alternatives to peanut butter with added nutritional benefits and allergen safe. Unlike regular peanut butter exerted to high roasting temperatures producing unwanted free radicals, this brand is sure stand the test if they continue upholding their manufacturing principles. One thing you may need to do is to thoroughly mix the butter before use since at the bottom it's too hard and the top too light. Some may need to put a little salt but my kids liked it unsalted."
"One of my cats is elderly and grooms himself a lot (lotsa hairballs!) - he is unable to digest most canned cat foods, but this stuff and the other Friskies Classic Pates (senior diet) suit him well."
"Ok for one the bonsai tree was only 3"" tall you don't get any off the rocks that are in the picture besides 1 rock that is supposes to be the big one but its only the side of a quarter. Very disappointed !!!!"
I bought a 24 pack of this an drank almost all of them before realizing what the flavor reminded me of. It tastes like hotdog water.
"My dogs loves this chicken but its a product from China, so we wont be buying it anymore.  Its very hard to find any chicken products made in the USA but they are out there, but this one isnt.  Its too bad too because its a good product but I wont take any chances till they know what is going on with the china imports."
"This tea works on my fiance's digestive track as she has an issue with colitis and this product along with essential enzymes helps her to absorb and digest foods that otherwise would give her pains while in her digestive track, Thank you for making this product we plan to continue using it as long as we can."
"Not only does this flour have the advantage of being organic (which is of questionable significance) but it has made my pizza dough and waffle batter much better than with previous flours. I am not sure if it justifies the high cost and I am not sure I will continue to use this flour due to the cost, but for now I am enjoying the benefits."
"Kettle Brand chips used to be so good...oily, crunchy, flavorful. I suspect the company has been bought out and the recipe has been changed for the worse. Now they're no better than any other big name brand chip. Try the Good Health Kettle Style Olive Oil chips instead. They are as good as the Kettle Brand once was. R.I.P., Kettle Brand chips. :("
"In an effort to lower my blood pressure, I've stopped eating bread, and was happy to find a great alternative. The Rye & Oatbran Crispbreads are very low in sodium. In addition, they have no fat and contain 2g fiber each. They are dry, so I recommend eating them alongside salads, or having a glass of water handy.  I love them."
My cat and my neighbor's cats would not eat this food. I wound up giving the case to the cat rescue organization.
"I loooove this product .... I use it a lot on my salads, vegetables  and to season meats ..... delicious !!!"
"These pork rinds from Lowery are a quick snack, but very easy to over-cook. I like the spicy and wife likes the plain. Hard to find in stores, so I order from Amazon.com"
"I am always looking to keep my calorie/protein/fat ratios within check to get the most nutritional bang for the buck. This is by far one of the top 5 finds for my smoothie arsenal. With 45 calories per 2tbsp, 5 g protein and 3g net carbs, 1.5g fat (no sat fat) ... This is a no brainer!"
"I really like this product---when my grocery stopped carrying it, I ordered it through the mail.  This is more of a quick bread than a cake, and it requires a can of cream style corn.  The result is very moist and has a good corn flavor.  I bake it in muffin pans in cupcake papers, and a dozen are small.  It makes about 8 good sized muffins.  I also bake these longer than specified on the package, because I seem to like things that are more done than many people.  These store well in a plastic bag in the refrigerator---if they are not all eaten by the end of the meal."
This is definitely the best mint tea I've ever had.  It actually tastes like mint.  Will definitely buy it again.
"This is my favorite! The bar is delicious and wholesome. The nuts and coconut rank #1. It's infinitely better than a regular candy bar, or fake energy bar."
This was gross. It lamb lund & smelled bad. There hard chips. My dogs Favorite is the Texas Taffy. Thats a winner. I cut it into peices. she LOVES THEM.
"I got these 2 weeks ago, for the price i wasnt expecting much, but they are really fresh and fragrant<br />i've used them to make bavarian cream and creme brulee and they taste great."
"I ordered these not knowing how good or bad they really were. They are amazing, incredible, delicious, and pretty good as well. The amaretto is injected by needle into two distinct bands that run the length of the cake, so the distribution is even and balanced. The cake itself is very good, reminiscent of a handmade pound cake of many years ago, before that horrible mess the grocery stores sell as 'pound cake' became the norm. Excellent flavor, texture, and moistness. Recommended without hesitation, UNLESS you are on a diet, in which case ordering this is akin to total surrender."
"This is my favorite starbucks roast, but why dont you just go to your local starbucks to purchase this, its the same price if you just go there and you dont have to pay for shipping and handeling and all that stuff, plus they will grind it for you there."
"I absolutely love this stuff, but I pay $2.00 to $2.50 for a 6-pack in the grocery store.  Why is this price so HIGH?"
"I agree with the others that say this is one of the best hemp shakes out there. I started off with the original Nutiva hemp powder and once I finished that I decided to try the chocolate. It is amazing! It is much easier for me to gulp this down in the morning. I mix it up in a Blender Bottle (also sold on Amazon) with a little water and some type of milk. I really like mixing it with vanilla hemp milk or whole grain rice milk but regular milk works fine, too!<br /><br />Nutiva is the LEAST grainy hemp shake I have come across yet. I have tried several kinds and even though I can drink them I much prefer Nutiva over any other."
"I have been an avid Canidae supporter for about a year and a half.  My breeder recommended it and I was VERY impressed with how my dog responded.  However, a few months back they changed their formula, (they also lessened the bags from 40 to 35lbs AND raised the price!!!!) and it is terrible!!!!  I went through 2 bags and couldn't understand why my dog was consistently producing loose stools, when she never had before.  Randomly, I found 1 bag of the old formula left at my local dealer so I bought it.  Immediately her stools firmed up.  Now I am again on a bag of the new formula, and again my dog is sick.  I am done, I will no longer support Canidae.  Do not buy it!  Do your research, at this kind of money there are A LOT of better dog foods out there."
"After eating TANG's chocolate and double-chocolate cookies, all other cookies will taste like expired, tepid dogfood to you. Her cookies will enhance your life in ways you never dreamed possible. Tim Horton's, Timothy's, Second Cup, Starbucks, Treats and those horrid packaged cookies at Zupas are just pathetic imitators to the grandeur that is a TANG cookie. HER COOKIES ARE DA BOMB!!! A+++++++ Hawt damn!"
"I am on my second can, I ordered the case of 6 and I keep it hidden from the grandkids.  I never thought you could have good tasting dark hot chocolate.  I just heat a cup of water in the microwave for 80 seconds and add the chocolate.  It dissolves completely with stirring."
I really like this organic brand and also their minimal packaging. Our almost 12 month olds really seem to enjoy the taste and the consistency is just right.
This tea is awesome.  You have to keep stirring it if it sits too long but the taste is great.  Little prep time- keeps me going all day.
"I have been a fan of Wintergreen Altoids for years.  When my last 12-pack ran out, I picked up a 2-pack of tins at a local store.  These taste nothing like they used to, and in fact taste nothing like wintergreen at all.  This flavour is like a combination of peppermint and ozone.  I will not be buying any more until they follow Coca-Cola's example and bring back a ""Classic"" formulation.  Neither will I be consuming the remainder of this most recent package."
"I purchased a case of these tomatoes a couple of months ago, and the cans were so badly bent and warped my can opener won't open them.  I complained to Amazon and they shipped another case out right away - but those cans are worse than the first case!  I won't order again."
I loved this!  I am a vegetarian and a mom that loves to have something in her purse for weak moments!  This totally fits the bill.  I looked on the Primal Spirit website before ordering to see the differences in nutritional content between all of the flavors and I was surprised that there was quite a difference.  I ended up choosing the Texas Barbecue because it equaled 2 Weight Watchers points and was the lowest in calories.  They are definitely pricey but in my mind totally worth it.  A lot come in a box and they are a great snack to carry with you!
"this is one of my favorite coffees try it you'll agree i love the whole bean coffee so fresh and tasty , no need for any creamer , nor sugar"
"I wouldn't buy these again. They are way to sweet, not fling, and do nothing to curb appetite.  Not sure what I expected of these but I would not buy them again.  There are far better products out there for the price."
"I found Branston pickle unappealing on it's own. Bit too tangy for my pallet, but I read it was great on Beef and cheddar cheese sandwiches and it is!<br /><br />I personally think it reminds me of A1 steaksauce with a chunky kick.<br />I look forward to finding more obscure uses for this British delight in my american home."
Popchip 100 calorie bags are a great snack that help me to control my portions.  I don't trust myself with the full sized bag!  These taste great and have a decent amount in the bags- there enough to satisfy me. They are not bland tasting like some baked chips.  I regularly order these and the BBQ flavor.  I have tried many other Popchip flavors (in the big bags) and these are my personal favorites! I don't know how them make them taste so great for so little calories- but thanks Popchips!
"love it. eating it has got to be a ritual. taste is well balanced, nice and chewy without being overly sticky, leave a great lingering aftertaste.<br /><br />compared to gimbal's scottish dogs, these taste and feel more traditional, and much healthier too, given that only four ingredients go into them.<br /><br />out in the midwest, ann abor to be specific, i found these in the candy aisle for around $2.80 per resealable bag of 170g."
my daughter is a chocoholic and says these are better than godiva. I get them for her every christmas and birthday.good price too.
"I liked the flavor and the ease to mix this tea.  I use a few packets and make a pitcher to keep in the fridge.  Very good COLD and needs NO sweetening as is lightly sweet already.  Doesn't look pretty, but DOES look like a healthy drink!  I liked it!"
"Well, the other reviewer are correct; this is a very fine cat food. Yes, it looks and smells tasty--flakey chunks in gravy. Probably tastes as good as human food (and just as expensive, but I presume it is formulated for cats). I like the way it is packaged and the small servings are just right. I actually divide it in half for my two cats, because I free-feed them kibble. They snarf it down!"
This coffee tastes so nasty I can't even drink it. It's disgusting. I can't believe anything this bitter is acid free. I actually threw away two bags.
"These pancakes are gross... they are pale and do not taste like pancakes. I bought these based on the reviews because the Maple Grove Farms pancakes were out of stock that week. I expected a lot more from Bisquick. I mean, when these pancakes are fully cooked they look like pale wafers of cream of wheat. If you leave them in a little longer to get some color, they just get hard and taste worse. I hate wasting food so I forced myself to finish the 3 boxes.. but I dont think I'll buy these again even if my other ones are out of stock. The only reason I gave these 2 stars is because they are gluten free. Other than that they're awful.. I'm so glad I've got my Maple Groves back this week and that these are out of my pantry!"
Love the clear vanilla flavoring for making white butter cream frosting as it doesn't change the color of the icing.
"One reviewer mentioned that this coffee was decaff and said it was listed as such on the bottom of the box (in small print). I checked my current box and saw no such labeling information. HOWEVER, the new boxes I received are a different color, with a slapped on label for Hawaiian Hazelnut and NOW the bottom of the box says it's made from 100% decaff coffee. While I like the flavor, I do NOT want decaff in the morning, which is when I drink coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I am unable to return this item to Amazon because of their return policy, which is why I'm writing this review, to make sure others know the coffee packaging has changed and it is definitely labeled as decaffeinated now. I would give more stars for flavor, but the lack of official notification in the product description that this coffee is decaff makes me feel as if I tossed my money out the window, buying something I would not have otherwise ordered."
The Lowrey's Microwave Pork rinds that I received was unacceptable.  I ordered 36 bags and the bags only popped 1/4 of the bag.  All rinds popped but for the amount of the money that I paid for them I could have gone to the store and bought a $2.00 bag already popped and gotten a full bag.  I feel that it should have popped at least half of the bag.  I understand that everyone is counting their pennies but I also think that the consumer should get something for their money.  I really enjoy this product but I probably will not order any more for this reason.
"I ordered two 24 can packs of 11.5 oz. V-8 juice, which were boxed together and filled with inflated plastic to buffer. When i opened the box, although all the flip-tabs appeared to be intact, one can had leaked some of it's contents and the juice was all over the other cans and inside the box. I weighed the cans to find out which one/s had leaked and that's how i determined which one to throw away.(the weight of the cans varied, but the variance was consistent, except one can was a few ounces short)  I am hoping it was just from the one can and i don't turn up with salmonella down the road. Since this was a UPS delivery, i am kind of surprised that amount of pressure was put on this package. Usually get superior service from them. I have ordered like this in the past, and the product arrived in perfect condition, so as i said, i was disappointed this time."
"The most important thing (to me at least) is that the color of this gold is great.  It may look greenish in the bottle, but on icing or fondant it has a nice warm color, not too yellow, not brassy, just really nice.<br /><br />I also like the different effects you can get through layering.  One coat produces a pearly gold shimmer, sort of like an Art Noveau enameled brooch. 2 + coats will get you a bolder solid gold look.  It's not going to come out like polished metal, but the effect is still VERY pretty and impressive.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this paint for writing or drawing on icing or fondant (you have to stroke over it repeatedly to produce crisp lines), but it's GREAT for ""highlighting"" raised areas and adding a beautiful something extra."
These are from China and nowhere as good as those from Italy. Spend the extra money and get those from Italy.
Started feeding my two older dogs (12 and 13) this food. My lab has always had dry itchy skin. After a week on Avoderm he is shiny and not flaky at all! My german shepherd is usually picky over food but he loves Avoderm. I highly recommend this food. Packaging and expiration date were fine and I will definitely order from amazon instead of buying in a pet store. The price is way cheaper! Higher quality food really does make a difference in the health of your pets...I wish I had started feeding them Avoderm sooner.
These K-Cups have damaged something causing the water to not come through my already made K-Cups. I now have to put a ready made in and puncture it then open it and turn the K-Cup and puncture it again for the water to come through. I think the material in the disposable K-Cup is too heavy and damages the needle on the bottom.
"This is a very, very mild ginger tea.  I take at least 2 bags in 6oz of water to even taste it.<br />I also found the quality rather cheap compared to similar priced teas.  Here are just some of the problems I found:<br />1. Cannot open sachet without scissors.  Many are missing tear marks.<br />2. The tag falls off on half the tea bags.  So you end up fishing the bag out of your tea.<br />3. The tag is glued to the sachet on several (maybe 20%) of the bags.<br />4. The tea bag rips apart when opening the sachet or when squeezing out your tea."
"This product says that it contains Kava Kava to help with it's calm tea, but there is no Kava in it.  This is confirmed by the tea box set as well as Yogi Tea website.  I just thought I would make anyone else aware in case they were looking for a little supplemental Kava for their tea, but don't want the other Yogi tea with Kava in it."
"Bought it thinking this would plug into the Wii and I would be able to use my condenser microphone with it. Well, long story short, doesnt work. But it is still usable with a PC/laptop to record audio. But we can do that with a builtin mic also. Would u like to pay 1$ towards the presidential election?"
"I wanted to like this coffee, I did. We've tried other Wolfgang Puck K-Cups and have been pleasantly surprised. This just did not impress us. Bitter aftertaste, and it has an almost sickeningly vanilla flavor. Smells great while brewing, but just does not live up to it in the cup. I'm really disappointed because I now have a box and a half of this product that we really do not want to drink! Great price though."
"i absolutely love these! they are a very strong ginger flavor and i love the texture of them.  i bought a 4 pack of rolls at whole foods and ate them in one day. and i wish i had more haha. low calorie and organic, cant beat that!"
"I bought a new bread machine and bought this collection of bread mixes as well as some single mixes to try it out.  The single mixes worked well as they included yeast packaged separately in the mix.  My machine states clearly not to get the yeast wet, to put it on top of the flour away from the water.  The mixes in this collection have the yeast in the flour, not packaged separately.  The bread failed to rise at all.  Why would they package the yeast separately in the single mixes and not in the multi packs?  Along with the Heartland Collection I also purchased the Baker's Choice Collection.  I am throwing them all out.  Don't waste your money."
My cairn terrier Daisy loves these basted bones. Having trouble<br />finding them in retail. I hope its not a sign that the product<br />is discontinued. She also likes the peanut butter basted flavor.
I Love this blend on Chicken for a Caesar Salad. I used to start thinking about it 2 hours before lunch. Serve the Chicken hot drizzled with fresh Lime juice. Awesome! I must have had it 20 times at Checker's in Calistoga.
I have a 95lb pitbull/ mastiff mix that often loves his rope bone and his squeaker toy and thought it would be great to challenge him with some thinking toys.  I was a bit weary of this toy because my dog might chew up the plastic treat covers but found they are rather tough and that food incentive was greater than the chew incentive.  Overall it took about 10 minutes with the advice of the instructions and my pup was on his way to collecting treats from his new puzzle.  It takes him a few seconds now to pull the right cap off and start chowing on his goodies.  Another thing I would like to note is clean up is pretty easy.  I washed the tray and cups with hot water and soap and let dry next to the counter.<br /><br />This is a Social Writeup
"I bought the 4 pack of this coffee based on the reviews of others and the price. It is a lot of coffee, since we drink less than 1 pot per day.  I really enjoy the flavor.  I put a little cream and sweetener (agave nectar) in my coffee, but this coffee has great flavor that comes through.  I'm not super picky on coffee, but I can tell when I have ""bad"" coffee.  This is definitely good coffee and I plan to keep buying this coffee as the only coffee we have in our house."
"I think the Pocky did not get stored rightly. The chocolate was falling off from the biscuit stick, and doesn't taste as it should. Many of them stick together, and whenever I want to split them up, it just becomes very messy. Now I need to clean up my desk every time after I have it."
"I bought 3 pasta shape varieties of these 8 oz. 2-serving bags of noodles in liquid in the refrigerated tofu section of our local grocery store for $1.99 per bag yesterday.  I am puzzled how they can be sold and shipped since the front of the bag states ""perishable - keep refrigerated"".  I opened the bag and smelled the noodles, and they did have a rather strange, strong odor.  I immediate poured the noodles into a strainer and then rinsed them under cold water.  I put them in a sauce pan with a small amount of Lorivo expeller-pressed peanut oil and let them sit for a while, stirring occasionally.  I decided to add Guilin chili sauce, garlic powder, powdered ginger, a small amount rice vinegar, water, 3 - 4 tsp. coconut sap sugar and 1/2 large can drained bean sprouts.  I warmed this mixture for awhile - maybe 20 or more minutes.  It worked!  I created a palatable side dish with a good- tasting broth and appealing consistency.<br /><br />I served this side dish with broiled tuna, mahi mahi, and a Spring greens salad mix with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.<br />I wish that these noodles were available in larger sized bags at a lower price per serving, but $1 per person for two modest serving sizes per bag isn't outrageous unless you compare this with the cost of regular pasta.  I added the bean sprouts because the noodles alone didn't look like enough food for 3 people, and I thought that adding bean sprouts would offset any texture issues with the noodles. This recipe has now worked out twice with no real concern about cooking time for the noodles. Maybe the vinegar is the key, but the noodles are just like any other noodles when prepared this way and they make a great noodles with Asian-style broth meal or side dish.  And finally ... a use for those canned bean sprouts!<br /><br />Update:  I have now mixed these with baked tofu and Asian-style sauce. That combo worked out great.  Also I took the wide noodles, rinsed them and then put them in spaghetti sauce to simmer.  They tasted fine. Texture-wise, they will always be somewhat slimy and slippery and not al dente like well-prepared pasta, but otherwise, they worked out well. Just remember - just 40 calories - in an entire bag! And next to no carbohydrates!"
"I typicaly drink Mountain Dew or more recently the Picth Black but this is my favorite soda! Beaware they have tried to change the logo and add the words ""Fruit Punch"" ... as if we don't know. It's just a bad logo change and someone should be fired for it. Unfortunatly I have yet to find a substitute for the times when I can't find it so get it while you can!"
"I ordered two of these bags for my three dogs - a mastiff, a lab, and a terrier mutt.  They arrived well packaged inside cardboard boxes.  The dogs like the food, their coats are shiny, and the mastiff didn't vomit when beginning this new food.  He has problems when switching foods, but he started on the Diamond Naturals with no problems.  I'm going to continue to buy this food for my dogs."
I bought a bottle of tapatio hot sauce for my friend to have it shipped over to her in the east coast. The order said it'd take 5 business days. It ended up taking over 3 weeks
We like this brownie mix and I usually use the low fat recipe on it. I also add chocolate chips or something else to it otherwise it ends up a little bit dry.<br /><br />We still buy this by the case.
"I love pumpkin, my dogs love pumpkin.  I quite often roast my own, but I need back up cans now and again.  Libby's has disappeared from stores.  This stuff is the only brand ANY store is selling.  It tastes like dirt.  It really does.  There is no fresh pumpkiny flavor.  It is also watery, which changes how pie and cake recipes turn up.  Finally, I gotta wonder-if LIBBY'S pumpkin harvest dried up, where are these guys getting theirs from? A mystery"
"Stash Chamomile Herbal Tea is tea bags with dried, crushed chamomile flowers.<br /><br />Honestly, as far as I'm concerned, chamomile is chamomile. I suppose that when you use loose flowers you get sediment in the cup and I have seen this happen with some brands of chamomile tea bags, these don't do that.<br /><br />I have also had organic chamomile (this isn't) but I can't taste the difference.<br /><br />Each bag is individually packaged and that is either good or bad depending on how and where you use it and if you are concerned about excessive packaging.<br /><br />If you really, truly like chamomile tea, or own a restaurant, this ginormous box of 1,000 single-serving tea bags is a good choice."
"As the product description says this is the perfect ""all day"" flavor for a wonderful tasting cup of coffee. It doesn't matter if you need it as your morning ""go juice"" or an evening coffee. You will be doing yourself a disservice if you don't give this one a shot."
"IN A NUTSHELL: Recently I have begun using this brand exclusively. Here's why.<br /><br />""COLAVITA - EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL"" has an impressive list of credentials that clearly set it apart from other makers of Olive Oil. This particular product boasts the following:<br /><br />-----*- Certification from the ""I.S.O."" - ""International Standardization Organization""<br /><br />-----*- ""Certified Authentic Product of Italy"", where the best olives for olive oil are grown under the best conditions<br /><br />-----*- Natural product, just olive oil - nothing added<br /><br />-----*- Excellent full-bodied taste<br /><br />What are the nutritional components?<br /><br />A tablespoon of olive oil contains 120 calories, 14 grams of fat, and no cholesterol. Seventy-seven percent (77%) of the fat in olive oil is monounsaturated and nine percent (9%) is polyunsaturated fat; fourteen percent (14%) is vegetable-derived saturated fat. Virgin olive oils also contain the antioxidants beta-carotene and Vitamin E, as well as the phenolic compounds tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol.<br /><br />WHAT EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE IS USED FOR:<br /><br />That being said, this is not an oil for cooking, as it has a very low smoke point. It is excellent for salads and for marinating and boasts a pretty low acid level. For cooking try their ""Extra Light"" product as it has a much higher smoke point.<br /><br />HEALTH BENEFITS:<br /><br />PROVEN PROTECTION AGAINST ATHEROSCLEROSIS:<br /><br />Eating foods high in alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) [found in Olive, canola & flaxseed oil] will increase the blood levels of omega-3 fatty acids. ALA has been shown to confer a large measure of protection against atherosclerosis. As part of the ""Mediterranean"" diet, researchers used products high in ALA, and found that the ALA reduced the risk of dying from heart disease by 70% over the first 27 months.<br /><br />Canola and Peanut oil also contain large amounts of ALA and are similarly cardio-protective. The presence of a larger proportion of ""mono-saturated fats"" is central to the cardio-protective properties of the oil.<br /><br />-----*- NO Cholesterol -- -*- No Trans-Fat<br /><br />WHICH SIZE IS BEST FOR YOU?<br /><br />This and most of their conventional oils are available at most groceries and this exact product sells for about $7.00 for 17 ounces [.5 liter]. Bear in mind, that Olive Oil will become rancid if you store it for prolonged periods. You can, however, extend this period by keeping the oil in a cool and dry place, preferably dark. Also, don't buy the largest containers unless you can finish them within 1-2 months. Stored correctly, Olive Oil will stay fresh for up to 2 years. Smaller containers like this 17-ounce bottle may be more costly per volume than the gallon, but the oil will be fresh when you use it and that is ultimately what its all about.<br /><br />[I AM NOT AFFILIATED WITH ANY PRODUCT OR COMPANY.]"
"We love this cereal and the fact that it has probiotics.  I am not a big fan of the DHA from external sources such as algae, because it is not the same as the DHA found in breast milk.  However, the cereal is good and our baby likes it.<br /><br />Recommended for anyone looking for good organic cereal."
The price was comparable to Walmart for same size product.  However these nuts were not as crunchy; and they needed a little more salt.
Spent $29  for real kona coffee and didn't want the kona blend sold here. The Hawaiian roasters was disappointing. Tasted nothing like the kona we had everyday while honeymooning in Maui. Not good
"Love the taste of this product, really keeps you full with just a small amount.  First bought it at Costco, they no longer sell this product.  The reason for the two stars, half the bag was crushed, could eat it with a spoon."
"Thought these were healthy treats, but found out that they are Made in China.  Noted on back of bag.  Concerned that it may fall into China made Jerky treats suspected to cause kidney problems in pets."
Two words: potato flakes. Not sure what the buzz about these is. Try one bag before you buy a case. Can't be returned.
"The package says that this is supposed to be practically break-proof, which I thought was perfect for my year-old Beauceron who is a pretty aggressive chewer.  Finally!  A toy that would make his brain work and keep him occupied.<br /><br />Three uses.  First one he very quickly discovered how to get the treats right out.  Second, he learned how to get the screw-off bottom to come off of the jug.  Third time - he chewed the plastic to bits by the time I got it away from him - and he was in the same room with me!<br /><br />I'm a dog trainer and only recommend high-endurance products for my clients.  This didn't even come *close* to meeting my expectations!  Total disappointment.  Will not buy another 'Premier' Busy Buddy toy for my chewer!<br /><br />At almost 3 years old, we still rely on the blue K9 Kongs, Holey Moley, and Everlast Treat balls to stand up to his strong jaws and chew drive!"
"You order (and pay for)D.O.P. Certified San Marzano tomatoes but you will receive ""CERTIFIED"" which means absolutely nothing. A true SM tomato will have an EU D.O.P emblem on the label plus the Corsorzio San Marzano stamp. This is false advertising.  If you enlarge the picture shown you can see on the upper left side partially one of the stamps. You will not receive this DOP label.  You will  receive another tomato from somewhere in the region under the Cento name. Typical marketing hoodwinking. Amazon refuses to take returns on this item, so beware."
"I prefer flavored coffees and this one and the pumpkin spice are my absolute favorites. The chocolate and raspberry go so well with the coffee that it's like drinking dessert. Love it! And SO glad it's available on subscription. Thanks, Amazon."
"i like a darker roast i guess. Its ok, prob would not buy again. i brew it on the middle selection on the keurig, not the full cup."
Nuttzo makes great nut butters. Their chocolate version is like Nutella should be--less sugar and other crap. Delicious and super-nutritious.
The product arrived on time and is very good. I will order more in the future.
"1.  Walnuts are the most unstable of all nuts.  While most nuts have a shelf life of a few months, walnuts go rancid within just a few weeks of being exposed to air and average 65-75 degree temp.  So if you buy 6 canisters of these and eat an ounce a day to help your cholesterol levels, they'll last you about 7-8 weeks. Which is the longest you should expect them to stay fresh.  If you want them to last longer -- freeze them in the unopened containers for up to 4 months.  And I'm guessing that jars or bags of walnuts are just wasted if sent through USPS/military mail channels to soldiers in Asia.  It's too hot and too long a trip.<br /><br />2.  If this product -- or any other for that matter -- arrives stale, then why aren't you calling Amazon or the supplier to return them and get your money back!  This is one of the reasons I try to buy items from Amazon that say they are sold and shipped by Amazon --because Amazon stands behind what they sell and I've never had a problem with getting  a replacement if something arrives in unsatisfactory condition.  To all those reviewers whining about stale products -- grow a pair, pick up the phone, and stand up for yourselves.<br /><br />3.  Read the reviews, and if you don't want seasoned nuts, don't buy these.  Not only are they seasoned, they also have a little sugar.  Not enough to raise the calories beyond those of raw walnuts, but it is a different nut than a fresh cracked walnut.<br />IF YOU WANT RAW WALNUTS, BUY WALNUTS IN THE SHELL.<br /><br />I agree that for internet buying purposes, the manufacturer should INSIST all the contents  be listed on every site, and should rename the product: SEASONED DRY ROASTED WALNUTS.<br /><br />The bottom line is, they have an excellent mild seasoned flavor, and a very DRY dry-roasted texture."
"I have been feeding these to our dog for years to help her with her joints, especially her hips. Ever since I started her on these as a treat, meaning I gave her one in the morning and another in the evening she regained her active self and they helped her get interested in her regular meals. It was a win, win situation for our finicky eater.<br /><br />However, I would like to note, that when I started her on these treats, they were being made in the USA. Resentfully I discovered that they are now produced in China. As we know, China produces some very high end products and some real crap as well. However, when it comes to food products that come from overseas a warning flag goes up in my mind, especially if they are coming from China. Personally I never noticed anything odd with our 14 year old dog's reaction to Happy Hips. Still, I decided that I did not want to subject her to a food product coming out of China.<br /><br />Does anyone know of another product like Happy Hips with Glucosamine (for the joints) in it, that is produced in the USA?"
"This is truly bad loose leaf tea.  I still haven't used very much of it and I bought it some time ago, and no it didn't go bad (unless it was shipped bad), as it was very subpar when I first got it.  Quite bitter and lacking any maltiness whatsoever (at best it tastes slightly above Lipton bagged tea).  Do yourself a favor and order from teasource.com or uptonteas.com both are far better then this.  Heck even Teavanna is better than this.  Extremely disappointing....can barely make passable sun tea out of it."
"Hello. My name is Maggie, and I'm a finicky eater. I'm one of three furry beings that share a dwelling with our friend Two Legs, and the food that is usually served is gross. Fancy Feast! Ugh. I refuse. Poached salmon I grudgingly nibble on because of the omega oil (makes my fur shiny). I do like sirloin steak when it is cooked precisely medium rare...but wait!<br /><br />Two Legs is opening up something new!<br />It smells wonderful. Enticing.<br />Looks good too.<br />WOW. What a flavor.<br />Tuna and Shrimp. Tuna and Sole! Yellowfin! And the Snapper is the cat's pajamas.<br />I'm in heaven.<br />Thank you Two Legs. From now on, only buy Petite Cuisine Variety Pack (the Chinese Chicken and Chicken Pot Pie is delectable too)."
"I have a mini Dachshund, and she's just a puppy so she's very busy, she loves this thing but the treats have to be really small to get out I use Zukes minis, however she will grown and drag that thing all over the place flinging it around to try and get the stuff out and very rarely she does but she keeps trying"
"These chips are the best!! I've tried some of the other flavors and they are ok, nothing special... but the Mesquite BBQ is hands down the best BBQ chips I've ever had! if you like BBQ chips (and are not concerned with the calories most chips bring), then you will not be disappointed in these!"
"The name of this flavor sounds fantastic, and I wondered why they didn't include them in their multi-flavor assortment. Then I tasted them. These chips are terrible, there is no parmesan flavor to speak of, and they somehow messed up the garlic as well. Avoid these and the also-no-incuded-assortment flavor of ""jalapeno"". Very disappointed.<br /><br />The cheddar, vinegar & salt and peppered flavors are FANTASTIC!"
"These are the most convenient coffee creamers I have ever found.  No more messy powder packets that could pop open and ruin my purse.  I loved these from the first day I saw them.  They are a blessing for traveling.  Now it doesn't matter what flavor coffee establishments have, I can make it be the flavor I want."
I really enjoy eating these chips and love the fact that they are a healthier alternative. My family enjoys eating these chips as well.
"When I opened the package, I only found 11 packets of the Honey Stingers. There should have been 12. I counted and re-counted 4 times to be sure. The packets were in a thin cardboard display box, wrapped in a sealed plastic bag, and shipped in a sturdy cardboard box. I don't really want to go through the hassle of returning the item, so I guess I'm out a pack.  It'd be nice if amazon shipped me one more packet! ;-)"
"This slop has the color and consistency of baby diarrhea with whole peas in it. Our cat ate less than half a bowl of this slop and immediately puked all over the carpet!<br /><br />She devours the Felidae Platinum, (which we feed as an occasional alternative to Newman's Own Turkey). She was raised on Felidae dry, so I can say that generally the Canidae Company provides quality products... except for this grain-free slop. You can find the good stuff at: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFL09S"">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Senior and Overweight Cats, Platinum Diet Formula (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a><br /><br />Absolutely do not order this slop from Amazon because they will charge you $10.70 for the privilege of returning the 11 cans your cat will not eat. Before you make the same stupid mistake I did, buy a can from your local pet food store and try it out first. Then, when your cat pukes this slop back up, you will only be out $1.59 instead of the $27.94 Amazon nailed me.<br /><br />In my opinion, your cat and you will be much better off with Newman's Own Organic cat food, especially the turkey and chicken. The Newman food literally brought our cat back from the brink of death! After we listened to our former vet and fed her Science Diet K/D, she dropped down to less than 4 pounds in a month. We switched her back to Newman's Own Turkey and within one 24-case of small cans she was back up to her usual weight of 6.2lbs, and has maintained that healthy weight for over 6 months. She also gained increased mobility after we stopped feeding her the K/D. I read somewhere that Science Diet buys veterinary students their books in exchange for their later recommendations of their products. Nice.<br /><br />Just say NO to Science Diet and Felidae Grain Free Formula. Here's the good stuff: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK8HJ0"">Newman's Own Organics Turkey & Vegetable Formula for Cats, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br /><br />(Did they really want me to post a video with this review? Would you? Then its unanimous, this review will remain video-free!)"
"<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DZFMEQ"">Pamela's Products Wheat-Free Amazing Bread Mix, 19-Ounce Packages (Pack of 6)</a>  This is really tasty, with a nice texture.  It is the only GF bread that I use, and my non-GF family who have learned that GF and baked goods are not always compatible agree that this is yummy.  Hooray for Pamela!  It makes a dense loaf, and is a bit spongey compared to wheat bread, but the flavor is nice and it doesn't have the sawdust texture of other GF breads.  It is nice to be able to have a sandwich, or toast again!"
"Our cabinets are filled with every salt-free seasoning there is. We rely heavily on Mrs. Dash, and really love it. However, I saw this listed on Amazon.com, and it was the first time I had ever seen it. Based on good reviews, I not only purchased it for my house, but sent a package to family members with heart issues. Now that we have all used it, the reviews are in -- all of them great. So far, we've used Cavender's on chicken cutlets, whole roast chicken, talapia and cold pasta salad with chopped vegetables. We love it and will make it a definite part of our spice rotation.<br /><br />If you are looking for something new to zest up the flavor of salt-free food, Cavender's All Purpose Greek Seasoning is really quite good!"
"This stuff sounded perfect...way too much red dye and no taste according to me and my 3 friends who tried it...kind of salty.  Basically, I would stay away from it.  I am tempted to toss it out, but paid too much to feel right about it..."
"I bought this tea many months ago and waited to review it, to see if I really liked it over time.<br /><br />I do.  This tea is really lovely.  The rose scent and taste are just right -- not too lame, not too overwhelming.  I find it slightly calming, even with the caffeine from the black tea.  Of the 6 or so loose teas in my drawer that I regularly use, this is the one I seem to reach for most often.  I'm diligent about brewing times.  This one is 5 min. and I set the timer.  Gives me a perfect cup every time.<br /><br />Don't forget that it's organic.  Support organic practices and do something beneficial for your body.<br /><br />This tea was a good buy and has withstood the test of time (for me)."
"This stuff is ok, not great but not bad. Trying to find anything made of real ruffle and only real truffle is futile. As far as I can tell, and from my research, no company in the world makes a truffle oil that is only made with real truffles and tastes ok. This stuff is only good for using at Olive Garden."
"Haribo's has the best gummi candy.  I love the pink grapefruit, but it is very hard to find unless you have acess to a candy store.  Haribo has the best candy... Amazon has the best price."
"Great popcorn will be purchasing more very soon. The taste is excellent, you don`t have to add anything extra just pop and enjoy."
"My daughter is on the autism spectrum and very picky.  She has also recently been discovered to have sensitivities to wheat, dairy, eggs, soy etc..  This was our last hope for her to be able to have a sandwich.  We ordered the single package first and prepared it with the suggested egg replacement, in our bread machine on the gluten free setting, which did not mix well, and was not fully cooked in the middle when finished.  So we took a leap of faith and ordered the 6 pack of Pamela's bread to try again because the taste seemed very good from the small pieces we ripped off the ends.  When I made this the second time I used the regular oven, and used less liquid (as suggested on the package to avoid under cooking) ---and tada!!!  It's wonderful, and lighter and softer than any other gluten free mix we've tried (we've tried 4 others) and my daughter ate it!  She can now enjoy a cashew butter and preservative free jelly sandwich on real bread!  Whew! Thank you Pamela."
"Our friends from Germany visited with us a few weeks back, and one of them adores Manhattans. She had them here 15 years back, and when I no longer could find a bottled mix locally, I ordered it from the Internet. This is my first experience with Master of Mixes, and the Manhattans turned out great, just as good as if I had made them from scratch. A great product!"
"We do pet adoptions and also run a shelter for cats. I personally own 7 cats!!! I have absolutely never had a problem with feeding these to any of my cats.<br /><br />They have NEVER vommited from this treat, I have a hard time believing this!!<br /><br />I do know that the recommended amt of treats is only 10.. I have never fed more then 10-12 at a time!<br /><br />At home I have adopted a persian and I often use the hairball treatments with her and they actually DO WORK!!!!! I give her the suggested doce of 10 treats at a time and they are very tasty. Since, I have never seen her gag from hairballs, not once!<br /><br />All of my cats come running when I open these treats. My favorites are the vitamins as well as the hairball and the regular plain I also love to feed them. They love them all!<br /><br />The ONLY other treats I feed usually are Pounce and Party Mix but Temptations are there favortires!<br /><br />I HAVE ABOUT 8 BAGS OF THESE IN MY CABINETS... Because I have a lot of treats!<br /><br />At the shelter I run, we keep all kinds of cats and kittens and we have about 35 right now and NONE have never had any problems with these treats to date. I am sorry that others have maybe had problems but these are the most tastiest and healthy treats available. I also love that they provide GREAT dental care and tarter control.<br /><br />Providing these treats I honestly feel that my vet bills will be less in the future with also providing treats that they absolutely LOVE!!!!<br /><br />My mom and I pay the vet bills for any sick cats, we love cats!!! So far we have been blessed with wonderful healthy strays and none have been diagnosed with feline aids or Leukemia and we do vaccinate and have them tested.<br /><br />Please give these treats a try, they are awesome! Oh and also buy the large bags because it is actually saving you lots of money from buying the smaller bags.. You get about 3x the ammount!"
"If you purchase saffron then chances are you have encountered at least one of my other saffron reviews. I've tried most of it from Amazon after finding it exceptionally difficult to purchase decent saffron in my small town. Unfortunately, nothing replaces the truly exceptional delight that is pure saffron so my search for superior saffron continues.<br /><br />There we no other reviews on this and I was a bit hesitant to purchase an entire 1 ounce tin especially from the Roland brand name which is often associated with imports from China. The description did not even indicate if this saffron was from Spain or not but the price was ultra-right (also somewhat suspect since it was such a good price).<br /><br />First, set your mind at ease...this saffron is indeed from Spain rather than the often inferior products from elsewhere. It comes sealed in a plastic bag inside a decorative tin but even at that, the aroma was clearly evident before opening the shipping box.<br /><br />As for the quality of the saffron. It's good but not great. To test, I make a standard dish and compare the quantity required to bring it to the right level of taste...it required more than that of the Frontier brand of Saffron (very fresh but the selection of packaging requires it to ""air out"" due to lingering odor from plastic liner) but not nearly as much as some of the other dried little sad saffron selections I've encountered in local grocery stores or even via ordering here online.<br /><br />The actual touch/texture also denotes a fair level of freshness rather than the dry stubble of inferior brands but wasn't quite as supple as I'd normally desire.<br /><br />Fragrance - very nice and aromatic.<br /><br />Overall - for the price, I'm very pleased. It will not be my first choice on the finest dishes BUT it does provide a very solid option for general use with a price that won't make me cringe.<br /><br />On a side note, Amazon and/or the Roland brand ran a special promotion for an additional percentage off all Roland products...combined with the subscribe and save option this was the best price per ounce I've EVER encountered for true Spanish saffron. Keep an eye out for guilt free, affordable saffron you can use in any dish rather than having to save for special dishes only."
"Long story short - these are very tasty. We have purchased a number of flavors from this brand, this is my favorite.<br /><br />BUT... as noted by another reviewer - these contain MSG in the form of ""Yeast Extract"".<br /><br />It has become a popular means of hiding MSG lately by calling it different things, as a person who now finds himself having to use more caution in what I consume I find the whole process of hiding in plain site very bothersome.<br /><br />Also, the bag is not very large, but half of it is air. This may well help in shipping, but when paying a premium price for 'organic' it just seems more deceptive."
"The first time I used this pumpkin, my pie was TERRIBLE (goupy, flavorless), and I figured I must have done something wrong. I made my next pie with Libby's, and it was perfect. So I decided to try the EXACT SAME RECIPE with the Farmer's Market Organic Pumpkin again tonight. AWFUL!! Watery, miserable. I let the pie bake longer, in the hopes that it might thicken up, but it's still goupy and doesn't taste pumpkin-y at all.<br /><br />The pumpkin itself was thin and lumpy as I mixed the ingredients, and while I think I managed to work out the lumps, it just wasn't very ""pumpkin-y"" smelling or tasting.<br /><br />I will NEVER buy this product again. I prefer ""natural"" and organic alternatives, and I know that they can sometimes require recipe adjustments, but this is just unacceptable.<br /><br />""Certified Organic"" apparently doesn't always mean a better product!"
This may be my favorite type of Celestial Seasonings so far. I am a huge tea drinker and I love the sweet and spicy blend you get from this mix. Plus I am a huge fan of my K-cup machine. So just before bed now I have a cup of Mandarin Orange Spice.
This cereal is awesome and our very favorite of all of the Nature's Path Cereals.  We love it and buy it in multiple boxes!
"To me, fruit juice in small cans are simply a staple - first example that comes to mind is good ol' Dole pineapple juice. The trend towards trendy little ""health"" beverages in overpriced little cans is nearly tragic.<br /><br />There is nothing about this product that would compel me to buy it. If I want a soda, I'll just grab one. I don't drink enough of them to have much dietary impact and despite the claim of ""100% What You Want"", there is nothing in here for me. If I want 100% Of What I Want, I will buy a few oranges and some seltzer water. If I want ""0% Of What You Don't Want"", well, why buy it?<br /><br />This is a time when we had better look pretty closely at what is an indulgent convenience and what is a necessity, and how to find a happy medium. I consider the likes of Pellegrino Aranciata, Orangina and Izze a luxury, and when I indulge it is a true delight.<br /><br />""Switch"" is a product that is not better tasting, proven healthier, or even less expensive than any of many other alternatives. Once again marketing is driving product creation and design, and that is a hateful concept.<br /><br />If you want a similar taste experience for about the same price,  pick up some Alka-Seltzer Cold Plus Nighttime- you'll stop sneezing and sniffling and get a great night's sleep."
"It is rich and smooth, unlike most bold brands that can be too bitter. Grew up on latin coffee and this Supreme really leads the pack."
I'm really picky about the gum I chew.  This is great and the flavor lasts a long time.  I recommend it.
"Duncan Hines used to be my favorite line of cake mixes. I bought them all of the time. But now they, like Betty Crocker, have downsized their packages of cake mix. These new mixes will not work with older recipes, that called for the 18.25 ounce size of cake mix. That rules out a lot of our favorite cakes. Even a plain cake will be changed - it won't bake up as high or as big in the pan. Duncan Hines just lost me as a customer.<br /><br />Pillsbury has not reduced their cake mix sizes (at least, not yet). I will be buying them. If they shrink in size, I will bake from scratch."
"If I just want a good cup of coffee, not anything fancy, dark Roast is the one I go for."
"After years of being addicted to Smart Puffs, as soon as I tried these Sea Salt & Vinegar chips, I was an instant convert.<br /><br />They are light, crispy, and perfectly salty and vinegar-y.<br /><br />I think they taste amazing, however, my husband can't eat these chips because they make his eyes water. I *love* vinegar (I could drink the stuff if it wouldn't kill my stomach) so I don't understand how he's not obsessed with these chips (he likes the BBQ the best...). I guess if you're sensitive to vinegar-y tastes, this may not be the chip to you.<br /><br />However, if you LOVE Vinegar, like I do, these chips will pretty much take over your life as your favorite food. I sneak them all day. And they aren't terribly bad for you (12 grams of fat in a large bag), so if you overindulge, you won't have to add an extra mile to your workout the next day. However, you will get a raw tongue.<br /><br />My only complaint is that some of the bags are a little overcooked, and the chips are a light brown instead of golden colored. But they still taste the same, and are far and above any other Salt-and-Vinegar chip I have ever tried, including the ones that are terribly bad for you."
"I bought this pumpkin because there is none available in our markets due to the great pumpkin crisis of 2009 or something equally drastic.  Its primary use is to prevent hairballs in my cat and it works.  I usually mix it with some canned cat food, but when I ran out one night, I gave it to him straight and he scarfed it down as if it were candy.  It lasts a long time (he only gets about 2 tablespoons a night), smells wonderful and I plan to use it in some muffins as soon as I get the time to make them.  I like being able to give him something organic, as he's an older gentleman, and I like having organic for my own cooking."
"""Santa"" brought our family a ""real"" popcorn machine from Discount Tommy's a few years ago.  We have used it almost every weekend since then!  I had been concerned about the amount of microwaved popcorn my family was eating and thought this would be somewhat healthier.  We have really enjoyed the Great Northern Popcorn--all we have ever used in our machine.  The pre-packaged all-you-need ingredients are so convenient!  If we ever wear our machine out, I know that ""Santa"" will bring us another machine from Discount Tommy's and a huge box of Great Northern Popcorn again!"
"Found out about this stuff on TheWorldAccordingToEggface and everything she uses this stuff in really tastes better.  I use it in protein shakes and protein sugar free low fat homemade ice cream.  It just adds a touch of flavor with no calories, sugar or fat. My favorite shake is using coffee, protein powder, dash of Any Torani Syrup, fat free milk and ice.  Yummo!!!  Thank you Torani, Thank you Eggface!!"
"This was the most potent orange drink I have ever had. It might be ""100% juice,"" but this drink has some kick.<br /><br />There are no artificial sweeteners in this drink, but it is so highly concentrated that it was overwhelmingly sweet and even the tang of the carbonation couldn't cute into the sugary flavor.<br /><br />It was WAY too strong for me and I thought it had kind of an odd aftertaste, but if you like carbonation and have a powerful craving for orange-tangerine, this is the drink for you."
I did not know that I was ordering biscuit crumbs. That is exactly what I received. Such a lousy product. It's Amazon's fault for shipping out expires products. Will NEVER order food from Amazon.com ever.
"I have two indoor small dogs, Poodle and Maltese, and they have high anxiety, especially my maltese and these seem to help! Even if it doesnt they sure love 'em. My maltese before he ate it set it down and rolled all over it, I think he likes it! I'd give it 5 stars but its just a little pricey."
"With <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00389Q4XW"">Green Mountain Hot Cocoa</a> being perpetually out of stock in the winter, I thought I'd give the cheaper Grove Square brand a shot.<br /><br />Since the K-Cup patents are starting to sunset, Grove Square is one of the first ""unofficial"" producers of ""we can't legally call these K-Cups but they work in your Keurig(R)(TM) coffee maker"" pods, and I thought that I'd be getting the same overall quality, without the licensing fees tacked on to the price.<br /><br />Well... I was right about Grove Square being cheaper. But I think that's the nicest I can be.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, there's a definite ""diet"" or ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E6LBXK"">Splenda</a>"" aftertaste. This hadn't been reviewed yet when I bought it, so I didn't see the warnings from others, and re-checked the ingredients several times to make sure.<br /><br />""Well... it's got 60 calories, which seems a bit lower than Green Mountain, but a bit high for something that diet-conscious people would want."" and the ingredient list didn't seem to point to obvious ""diet"" sweeteners.<br /><br />The overall taste is kind of like someone dropped a sugar-free Tootsie Roll in your hot water, using the normal cup setting. Going one size down didn't seem to improve much, beyond making a weak chocolate flavor sweeter - but that just meant a heavier shot of low-calorie sweetener to the taste buds.<br /><br />The way I see it, I saved about $5 by going with this brand. On the other hand, now I've got 20 of these cups left that are probably going in the trash if I can't sucker someone... er... please my discerning guests... with a few cups.<br /><br />If you drink diet soft drinks by choice, you're probably going to like this."
I don't care if they're natural and not fried. The taste is odd and the texture is like packing material.
My dog loves his Greenies. I give him one in the evening hoping that it cleans his teeth.
"First, a bunch of us tried this product, but rate it poor after comparing it with another brand. And, we found out it has granulated garlic, possibly onion. It does not say it on the ingredient label like every other jerky company does; even in addition to ""spices"". Here it is part of the ""vegetarian spices"" ingredient.<br /><br />  The company does not seem very forthcoming. Anyway, we found a company tasty eats which sales ginger, teriyaki, original, peppered, hot n'spicy and even unsweetened jerky and none of it contains garlic or onion. We also found it to be the best in quality, texture and flavor. In fact, we ordered six cases of the ginger direct from the company. They are out of their bestselling teriyaki, original and many other flavors. But, we'll order those when they are available.<br /><br />  Really try it, it is truly the best: tasty eats soy jerky. We have tried numerous jerkys for vegans and vegetarians; and many do not want garlic or onion powder in them. This tasty eats soy jerky is the best tasting and what more, no onion or garlic powder in any of their product line. They are rated 5 of 5. This primal strip does not compare."
"These are great, but I find they need about 3.5 to 4 minutes to cook, and let stand 2 more minutes."
"Well, yeah the Sauce is awesome. I had a lot of fun with it, especially with friends who say it cant be that hot. Seariously, everyone i know said its the hottest thing they ever had. Since im kinda used to it, it has a great taste at all. But pay attention, dont drop it on your hands, or your hands will start burning and its getting worse when you put them under water."
"While in Thailand for 3 weeks many years ago I discovered ""ginger tea"" which was (to me) a tasty and warming beverage that calmed my stomach. It took a long time to find an equivalent drink once I got back, but this seems to be the same thing. (ginger tea in tea bags is not the same product, and I could not seem to re-create it by boiling fresh ginger) This stuff is great for stomach problems, but I drink it for the taste even when I am fine. I was surprised to find it here on Amazon - I used to have to search larger Asian stores and odd corners of the internet to get it. I am pleased to see that it has become more available."
"Hazelnut coffee is my favorite and our local stores don't carry it, as we live in a very small town.  The flavor and taste of this coffee is wonderful.  I  start every day with it and often have an afternoon treat of a cup of the coffee.  I will buy again and highly recommend. Arived far earlier than I anticipated."
"The can that is shown says D.O.P. certified but when my relative ordered them from Amazon.com, the cans that were shipped only indicate CERTIFIED. One can buy these non-DOP at any Walmart. What do they mean by CERTIFIED? Certified as to what?<br /><br />Unfortunately, the venders are making fools of Amazon.com. As a consequence, I am staying away from Cento products entirely. Fool me and Amazon once, shame on Cento; fool me and Amazon twice, shame on me and Amazon. There is no way I can make this review FUN!"
The Solo K-cup works perfectly instead of these.  I Totally agree with the Poor Performance review.  I also got coffee grounds in my cup everytime I used these (yes even with the filter). The cup is poorly designed. It clogged the system causing the water to back up producing a half cup of coffee or water spilling outside the top of the unit.
I had a bag of these during a trip to London. I was looking for Walker's Frazzles but this was the only bacon-flavored chips I could find at the Tesco. The taste is very similar to Frazzles if not better. It tastes just like bacon! Even suitable for vegetarians.
"This is probably the worst gum I've ever had.  Since I unwittingly bought so much of it, I brought it to my workplace and shared it with no less than 10 fellow employees.  Nearly everybody thought it was disgusting, while some thought it was mediocre or bearable at best.<br /><br />I bought it because I don't really like mint gums and I tend to enjoy more fruit-flavored gums.  I was definitely let down.  It doesn't taste like strawberry shortcake.  It's a very unnatural, artificial taste that is very strong."
"This drink was sickeningly sweet (and I am a Mountain Dew addict, so I usually have no problem with sweet).  It was much like drinking snow cone flavoring straight from the bottle.  While it is all natural with no added sugar, it still has 140 calories in an 8.3 oz can.  A 16 oz can of Mountain Dew has 170 calories.  Definitely not a ""diet"" drink.  The only way I would recommend it is to keep away from high fructose corn syrup, but even then, at the price, it almost too expensive of an option."
"I bought this for my mother's 50th birthday. She loved space-food sticks as a kid but it was more of a nostalgia thing than a ""tasted amazing"" thing. We all know space-food sticks taste like modeling clay. But this assortment of food with the retro space-food sticks magnet was perfect.<br /><br />She loved the gift and the dried cinnamon apples and peaches were delicious! I wish they sold them in large quantities outside of the space-food package.<br /><br />(The strawberry section of the space ice cream was delicious as well)"
It didn't work well for me in the microwave. Will not purchase a 2nd time.
This is not as tall as they advertised. But we kept it and we like it alot. It is the shining star of our indoor Bonsai collection. Just stunning. Like having a forest in your kitchen! We've had it about 6 months now and it's thriving.
"This product comes from a very good company that makes a number of excellent Gluten free as well as non-gluten free baking products. DO NOT let the poor quality of this one product keep you from trying other products they make. This mix is a classic example of a very poorly designed and likely untested Gluten free product. It lacks enough sugar and moisture ingredients to make the finished product taste good and mix well. As with many Gluten Free products new to the market, you find yourself constantly adding ""something"" to try to make it right. To these, I had to add nearly a full cup of sugar to begin to dissipate the very bitter taste. I added both applesauce and plain yogurt during different baking sessions to get a consistency that would feel and move like a muffin mix. THIS mix takes too much ""Doctoring"" to be recommended at all until Hodgson Mill goes back to the drawing board and fixes this. BUT, Hodgson Mill does have other good products. Try their Blueberry Muffin Mix and hope that one day Amazon will carry a wider array of their Gluten Free offerings as many are very, very good."
I stopped eating oreo cookies about twenty years ago or more. These are very good. All the organics and lack of assorted chemicals like High Fructose Corn Syrup and more make them safe to share with the children.
"These are the best chips ever!  The BBQ ones are on the spicy side, which I really like.  I used to think baked chips were good until I tried Pop Chips.  There is no comparison!  The baked chips are thin, flat and tasteless next to these.  If you want a chip you can really sink your teeth into you will not be disappointed!"
I guess it's my fault for ordering chocolate online... but these arrived completely melted. I am not sure whether I can return this or not but I was really looking forward to eating these. I ate samples at the Sony Ericcson Open this year. And watching the Roger Federer airport commercial on TV made me really want to get these. I got so excited when I got the package only to be super disappointed :(
"Oh Boy! Oberto Cocktail Pep Smoked Sausage Sticks, 32-Ounce Bag (Purchased on 02/19/2009)<br /><br />This was the worst product I have ever tasted. I have had many Oberto products, and this was nothing like what I've eaten before. Even my dog wouldn't eat them, they were so nasty tasting."
"This was not a good drink! I drank half of a can. After 30 minutes my hands were shaking out of control and my heart rate was elevated. I felt I had to get up and exercise so I wouldn't feel terrible, not because I had more energy. I didn't feel hungry and I had to pee every few minutes. I can't imagine what would have happened if I drank the whole can. I might as well have taken some crazy illegal substance, because the experience was not good!"
"I received two cases of Petite Cusine from Amazon.com earlier this week. I figured that this would be an easy product to review. After all, what could possibly go wrong with cat food? I have a cat. He eats food. Seems simple enough.<br /><br />Well, here's the problem... My cat, who is well-known for eating just about anything, refuses to touch this stuff. From the rest of the reviews here, you would think that this was some sort of feline version of steak and lobster. My cat refuses to play along though.<br /><br />I guess that I can understand why my cat keeps staring at me with this puzzled look on his face. This is not ordinary cat food. At least not the batch I received. Even before I opened the can, I was struck by the fact that there seemed to be more liquid inside than solid. Sure enough, upon opening the can I found the contents to consist of a LOT, and I mean a LOT, of water. It has more of the consistency of soup than of ordinary cat food. If it were human food, you wouldn't be able to eat it with a fork. You would need a spoon, or maybe even a straw. This seemed to be the case with all of the varieties that I tested on my cat.<br /><br />My cat refuses to eat any of the many flavors of this food I have put in front of him. No, he's not sick, and he seems to have a quite healthy appetite for his regular dry food. I wish that I could come up with even a single positive thing to say about Petite Cusine. Nice looking box? That's about it.<br /><br />UPDATE: Just to make sure that I was giving Petite Cusine a ""fair shake"", and to make sure that I didn't just wind-up with a ""bad batch"" of their product, I took a careful look at the ingredients list on their cans. Although the print is so small as to make me wish I kept a magnifying glass around the house, it was well worth the time to check out. It turns out that the #1 ingredient in almost every single flavor of this product that I examined is... fish broth. In other words... WATER!!! The only flavors that did not have fish broth as their #1 ingredient in the whole Petite Cusine line-up was Chicken Pot Pie and Sesame Chicken. The #1 ingredient in those flavors was chicken. The #2 ingredient in both was chicken broth! Some of the other ingredients included such cat ""favorites"" as carrots, sweet potatoes and soybean oil. Has anyone ever seen their cat eat carrots, sweet potatoes or soybeans???<br /><br />I can't blame my cat for not liking this stuff. I'm not sure I even want to know what goes into ""fish broth"", especially being as it comes from Thailand. Do yourself and your cat a favor and read the labels of what actually goes into their food. Spending a bunch of money on ""fish water"" doesn't sound like a good deal to me."
Arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags!!
"We have tried several kinds of gluten free bread for my celiac son who is three years old.  This has been the best overall in texture and taste.  It smells wonderful when its baking too.  We use a bread machine on the lightest crust at rapid bake, if the crust gets too brown the bread dries out too quick.  Keep in the fridge after the second day as it will mold after about 4-5 days, but will last alot longer in the fridge."
"Got product on time - early in fact,  Great Experience!  I would order from them again!  Very good place to buy these from."
"Our dog chewed through ate the vanilla infused rope.  Ropes do not show on x-rays and ultra sound.  The dog was vomiting up to 15 times a day.  Day 3 - our dog could not walk any more. Luckily our vet convinced us to do exploratory surgery and found the rope knot in our dog's intestines.  It is a very hard knot that will tear the intestines.  If not for this surgery, our dog would had died from the obstruction."
Best coffee in the world.  I'm so glad I found it here because other stores had stopped carrying flavors-only regular.
"Very tasty product, this is a wonderful coffee anytime day or night. Smooth flavor, medium strength, goes great with hazelnut liquid creamer, or any other for that matter."
"My dog, Spike, had a skin infection requiring taking 2 antibiotic capsules twice daily for just over a month, and the antibiotic had such a strong smell that I'd want to run away too when opening the bottle.  I've always snubbed Pill Pockets because of the expense - it was cheaper to bury medicines in pieces of hot dog, cheese, or bread or even burying it in peanut butter.  Stubborn Spike managed to figure all of these out though due to the strong scent of the medicine, and it made medicating him a nightmare.  As a last resort, I ordered Pill Pockets to give them a whirl.<br /><br />These really do make giving Spike his medicine so much easier!  In a week, he never turned his nose up or spit out medicine, and that means a lot less stress for this puppy mom.  Another reviewer said this and I figured I'd reiterate - they're a lot like chicken (or other meat, depending on your flavor) putty that's pre-shaped for capsules.  Spike's capsules (at 500mg each) were a little big for these pockets, but it was easy to shape around.  I know I'll be using these again rather than any other methods I've tried before."
"I have been looking for a site to order Snow's Corn Chowder.  Formerly a New Englander and now living in Florida, I cannot find my favorite chowder anywhere.  My whole family loves Snow's Corn Chowder and I promise to share with them if I can order a case.  Would some one please look around and see if you can find one.  The Florida Fredericks would be most appreciative."
"I am a big fan of Primal Strips. In fact, I loved the first flavor so much (Texas BBQ) I decided to buy others and really enjoyed it all with the exception of Mesquite Lime. Luckily, this was the last flavor I purchased and I was displeasantly surprised. I had a rough time even swallowing my first bite! Yes, it was that bad. The ""lime"" in this was horridly instense, very vinegar like. It is really all you can taste. So... if you like biting into a meaty-textured product with an overbearing flavor of vinegar, you may probably enjoy this flavor. Otherwise, if you are like me, stick to the other enjoyable, tasty flavors this wonderful vegan product has to offer."
the creamers where delivered very quickly to my house. Although the only thing I would have a slight complaint is that a couple of the creamers where opened making the other creamer containers a bit sticky. All I had to do was put the containers in a big pot of warm water for a couple of minutes. I did this three times until the water looked clear. Other than this I would say it's a good product.
This is a great tasting product!! Both me and my wife love it. I don't know how they did it but it is wonderful.
"You know how the chocolate turns light brown when it gets old? That's how these were at the top. They were that lighter shade of brown as if they were old. That part just didn't taste right, but the liquor inside was good. These candies weren't fresh."
Our dog loves this stuff.  Ground up and sprinkled on his dry food he just gobbles it up.  No additives or fillers no carbs. We also use as a treat.  Best price at Amazon and quick delivery.
"This tea was very smooth and comforting. I usually don't go for anything licorice flavored, but found that this tea is a nice combo of chai flavors with some anise undertones. I think it would be more than tolerable to someone who hates black licorice like I do! I'm not sure if it actually detoxes, but after drinking it (with food) for about 3 days I started getting rid of water weight and felt more alert without being caffenated which is definitely a plus. I had a little more energy and my mood calmed a bit. I think it needs to be consumed for a longer period of time maybe 2 weeks or more in order to really feel results, but that's the basic principle when it comes to detoxing with any tea or diet foods. I only had 3 bags of it so obviously it would have benefitted me had I a few boxes of this stuff. Good tea!"
"I don't know if its because I used too much of it, or its the coffee, or its just my taste, but this was way to strong for me. As far as the acid free part, that seemed to be true. It didn't flip out my stomach with too much acid like some coffee's do. I just didn't like the flavor of it. When I first opened the bag of coffee I didn't like the smell of it either. It just didn't have that nice coffee smell. Not sure what it smelled like, but it wasn't coffee and it was a really dark black fine grind that didn't look much like coffee either. I assumed that the package was supposed to be for a single pot of coffee and used the whole thing in my Bun Coffee brewer. It could have been too strong because my Bun Coffee brewer has a smaller pot than my old Mr Coffee does. But it doesn't seem to make that much difference with my usual Folgers coffee. While it was brewing it didn't smell much like coffee either. I tried a couple cups and it was so strong that after I dumped the grounds out of the basket I ran a couple cups of water through it to dilute the pot of coffee a little bit. Didn't help any, it still tasted way too strong for me. If I had some more of it I might try using half the prepackaged amount but I don't think it would change the taste of it all that much. Would I buy some of this coffee anyway because its acid free? No. Wouldn't matter how cheap it was either. Would I recommend this coffee to somebody? Not if they were one of my friends! Who would like this coffee? Maybe somebody that's used to having the very strong espresso coffee or the super strong coffee I've heard they drink in the middle east. But I don't think anybody that I know would like this particular coffee."
"Great price compared to the supermarkets.  My dog loves these and they seem less processed than most dog treats.  I don't know if they really help his hips, but he is a golden retriever (a breed prone to hip problems), so hopefully these will help as he gets older."
"Love these, buy them at whole foods all the time.....healthy pure organic and fair trade dark chocolate with yummy banana!  All the chocolates and fruits are good, but these are my favorite.  Helping the environment and small farmers all over the world too.  <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VIWUTE"">Kopali Organics Organic Chocolate Covered Dried Banana, 2 Ounce Pouch (Pack of 6)</a>"
"Watch out, we had a couple of bad tasting bags from a 40-count box from costco recently.  When opening up the third, many of the popcorn kernels inside were odd looking, inconsistent.  It is too bad, so now we are going to air popped popcorn, after using Orville's  bags nearly daily for a few years.  Eden's organic popcorn was OK so far, but harder to find.  Now will try Bob's (red mill?) popcorn kernels.  Hoping none of these are of the genetically modified type of corn."
Great product - 5 stars but my review is on pricing only.  You can buy Stubbs marinade at a Whole Foods (a.k.a. whole paycheck to some) for $4.49/bottle.
"My teenager loves this tea.  It only seems to be available during the holidays, so I bought her a case of 6 boxes.  She is so happy, and this tea is delicious - makes you feel warm and cozy."
"The beef nuggets are soft and easy on the teeth and tasty. If they are slightly less salty, they will be excellent.Very good snack.<br />Johnson"
"This is one great product!  Never again do I have to force a pill or some other disgusting thing down my dogs throat to give her glucosamine.  Both my dogs love the Happy Hips, but chicken is their favorite!  This one is a winner!"
"This smells more like cat food. My dogs ate the first can, but I mixed half with their previous food.  Now they won't touch it, even by itself."
"I have to tell you all this one is the best I've tasted. Seen this at Costco one day a month ago. I only had purchased one 4.5 lb bag. I had like it so much I had gone back for more. Although cheaper than Amazon, I still buy it off Amazon. Since Costco doesn't carry them again. I just placed in another order and he had arrived quick!. When I first did a order the Oats was shipped Next Air via Las Vegas. That's real good service from Amazon. As for this product you can't compare it with anything you buy at Whole Foods nor regular Oatmeal.<br /><br />I've prepare this produce on the store and in two different type of Steamers. I don't use water method. I only use Silk or Blue Diamond Almond Milk Original on both. I use also Honey from local Farm which I wish Amazon would carry. You really don't have to use Honey but I like it so I use it. I set this to cook for 15 minutes in a Steam Oven I got from Amazon. I also have BPA Steamer I also got from Amazon. That one 11L  I can place 3x glass bowls (pyrex type) In the steamer with water only 3x can be cooked in 20 minutes. In Oven Steamer it's about 15 minutes with the Conventional Fan going. On the store using Ceramic cookware cooks pretty fast though. I like the steamer better because you get the puff of hot steam and the oats taste just right.<br /><br />I have bowl of this Oats every morning and look forward to the next day to have it! Also clay soup pots can be also use with handles. Pick up one of these bags and try it for yourselves. You won't be without another bag in your home. You'll be hooked like my family is!"
"Like several other reviewers, my order just arrived and every can is dented.  None of them seem to be compromised so I will use them.  Just disappointing to receive something like this from Amazon.  I know it probably isn't their fault but they are still shipping it from their warehouse.  Would hate to receive other products in this condition. Farmer's Market should be ashamed of themselves. Having said that, I am pleased to receive them and so is my cat!  I have a feeling that people will be grabbing as much as they can of the 2010 pumpkin crop."
"If Keurig brewers were evaluated by this particular K-Cup, Keurig would be out of business. Wolfgang Puck - French Roast Melange Francais is inexcusably terrible coffee. Aroma hints of singed oak leave and the top note is simply bitter.  Mid taste is like the bottom ounces of a days old Kwiki-Mart carafe.  Mouth feel is harsh and leaves an appalling coating. The after taste leads one to immediately brush ones teeth.  I simply couldn't believe my Keurig was capable of making such a bad cup of coffee, so I tried again a week later with same results. I use average-to-good filtered water and have no problems with other brands like Green Mountain, Tulleys, nor Emeril's. Everyone I know that has a Keurig learned of it via word of mouth or a shared cup. Usually the results are stunning, and the Keurig invasion lives on.  When I share I'll stick with offering The Coffee Peoples' Black Tiger or Jet Fuel. Now I have 22 more WP/FR K-cups sitting in the bottom draw of my china cabinet to get rid of. Let me know if you want them, as I'd be embarrassed to even give them away.  Sorry Wolfgang, but what the Puck - your French Roast is unpardonably horrible, and at K-cup prices I'll not be duped again. I'll stay away from any of the other WP offerings."
"great coffee--this was way too much to pay for it, but i could not find it anywhere else at the time.  i feel a taken advantage of price-wise and probably would not order again."
"I was excited for these.  Got them on a Monday, on Tuesday I came in and my husband tells me you have to try these they are excellent.  So I'm like Ok, I reach in the bag and I'm like ewwwww they feel slimey but none the less popped one in my mouth.  I almost puked, I spit it right out terrible, disgusting, don't buy these.  I love Amazon and buy a ton of stuff from them but these are a definite NO!  I might add this was a joke to my husband because he had ate one and had to spit it out!  He was just wanting to watch me eat one.  :("
"My dog, Lucy, suffers from a host of allergies.  Of the higher quality dog foods on the market, Ziwi Peak is the only one without carrots or barley (two foods she cannot have).  Lucy loves this food and her allergies are much better--there are no grains, fillers, colors, preservatives or vegetables (I can give her those separately from home).  Without Ziwi peak I would be making stuff at home.  This is convenient and well worth the price--I only wish I could find a local retailer so I wouldn't have to order online..."
"I was looking for mint green tea I could carry with me to mix up while out and about. If that's what you want, then this product is perfect. I add a little extra water, but that's just my taste. So, if you're looking for mint green tea powder . . . look no further!"
"I'm one of the lucky ones who did not receive any damaged or crushed cans, though, I would not have cared at this point since I was desperate for pumpkin.  I needed the pumpkin for my dogs.  I do, however, notice that it does not work as well for them (their anal glands) the way the regular pumpkin does (Libby's) but I like the fact that they are getting organic."
"The product description says 12 packs of 12 (144 count), but when you order, you only get a box of twelve.  I did this weeks ago, talked to Amazon, but they still haven't updated the product description."
"unfortunately my dog doesn't agree.<br /><br />I have to count these cookies as a loss and reorder <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VD8DSO"">Three Dog Bakery Bitty Bites, Baked Dog Treats, Assorted Flavors, 13 ounces</a>.<br /><br />I'm only giving it two starts because I like the wholesome ingredients this brand uses."
"The description of this product is disceptive.  This product was represented as a powder, but it is not a powder, it's a granule.  It is nothing more than shredded coconut and doesn't even dissolve in a high speed commercial blender.<br /><br />Unless you are using this product to manufacture a dark chocolate-coated coconut patty, to me it is useless.  My intention was to use it as an additive in a healthy shake.  It ended up ruining the shake as I had to resort to chewing the undissolved, tasteless coconut pieces rather than drinking the shake.<br /><br />Additionally, the way the product was packaged, there was no protective cardboard preventing the slashing the top package when the box was opened.<br /><br />If I could have rated this product zero stars, I would have. The only redeeming quality was that it was rather inexpensive.  I gave one package away for FREE to a patient who loves coconut and she gave it back to me two days later complaining that it was terrible!"
"I bought this as a gift for Xmas for my best friend, whom loves chocolate  and loves liquor as well. When she opened her gift to find this, she shined the only cheese smile and said "" you know me so well"". She couldn't wait to try  them. According to her the Jim Beam is the strongest and the Remy Martin least strongest if I'm not mistaken. They are great tasting and the filling is a gel consistence and the chocolate great as well. Only thing i didn't like was the dents on the packaging, noting really to complain about or call the company about cause my best friend loved it either way.These chocolate liquor bottles are a great gift for anyone who loves chocolate and liquor and don't mind them together."
This is the most horrible stuff. Bacon? PLEASE!! I bought the 3 pack and gave 2 to friends. We all threw them away after one taste.
This is the best value Wasabi peas out there. A 5lb bag represents a lot of peas - but leave 'em out at work and they'll soon disappear! Tasty.
"Green Mountain Coffee, Nantucket Blend is my favorite coffee to use in my Keurig Brewer.  However, in this particular box, the coffee did not taste fresh.  Perhaps due to the large quantity in one box, it remained in storage too long.  At any rate, previous orders from other Amazon sellers, like az trading llc and pm trading, and smaller-quantity boxes from Amazon.com LLC were far superior."
"My Black Lab has been eating Canidae All Life Stages dry dog food since we switched her from puppy food to Canidae in early 2006.  Our breeder recommended this dog food.  She did well on the old formula, except for what we THOUGHT were seasonal hot spots where she would chew the hair off of the insides of her legs and also her behind.<br /><br />Since purchasing my latest bag about three weeks ago she has been throwing up, having frequent burping which smells of vomit, having horribly smelly flatulance, and I had to clean my carpet from a poop accident two days ago.<br /><br />I was initially just upset to find that my latest bag had been down-sized from 40 lbs. to 35 lb.  I sent an e-mail telling them that I would rather pay more for something than have it down-sized.  Their response was :<br /><br />""Our economy and industry is faced with challenging times, commodities and energy cost are at an all time high and continue to sky rocket.""<br /><br />They ended their response with this condescending comment :<br /><br />""We have also had a lot of positive feedback from our women shoppers who love the new sizes as they can handle them much better when unloading them from their car.""<br /><br />After talking with my dog's breeder, I discovered that the formula had been changed and that her dogs and many other breeders' dogs had been having problems with the new formula.  The ""Canidae Team"" didn't mention the formula change when I asked them about the down-sizing.  That would have been nice.<br /><br />So, I started searching the internet and found more horror stories of dogs becoming sick with the new formula.  Plus, many dog owners were upset that Canidae did not make much of an effort to inform their customers of the new formula change.<br /><br />I sent another e-mail to Canidae regarding the formula change, their lack of informing their customers about it, and how my dog has been reacting to it.  They didn't address my comments about how it was making my dog and others sick, they just stated that they did their best to post their changes on the internet.  From what I have been reading in posts, that is not the case.  I also found out through forum postings on the internet that Canidae is now in partnership with Diamond Pet Foods.  Diamond was involved in the dog food recalls where dogs were dying from the tainted food.  Maybe since the recall and deaths, Diamond has cleaned up their act and has more stringent guidelines and inspections but who wants to take that chance when it comes to our beloved dogs?"
"I read some negative reviews on the Farmer's Market Pumpkin but I'm glad I gave it a try anyway.  I was shocked when the pumpkin arrived two days after I ordered it.  The cans are in perfect condition and the pumpkin is a beautiful color, texture and taste.  I am very pleased with my purchase!!"
"I simply don't like it. It is easy to prepare, but when I eat it, I feel that i am eatting a lot of artificial ingredients. I cannot even finish one fourth of it....."
"My son is in MCC in Washington State, he received these items, and so far, no complains."
This product was exactly what I expected and met my requirements. If you like hot food I would recommend this item. I will prob order more sometime.
"I like the idea of a healthy soda type drink, but this flavor just missed the mark. The tangerine overpowered the orange and left a bad taste in my mouth. Carbonated juice is a great idea, they just need to tweak the flavors a bit.<br /><br />Ranking the Switch drinks from best to worst:<br /><br />1. Watermelon Strawberry<br />2. Kiwi Berry<br />3. Black Cherry<br />4. Orange Tangerine"
"I do not consider Gingerbread, Spicy Eggnog, Caramel Apple Cider, Spiced Apple Cider summer items.... You cleaned off your self at my expense!  VERY DISAPPOINTED!"
"This is a wonderful English Breakfast tea- nicely flavorful without being either too bold or too bland. Makes a wonderful morning tea without any sort of bitterness or tang-y taste to it. It's a nice comfort tea and a good start to loose teas for anyone who has been using bags and doesn't know which flavor loose teas to start with.<br /><br />I recommend brewing as follows: 2 teaspoons to 12-16 ounces of boiling water for 3.5 minutes. If you overbrew (particularly Adagio's teas), there's a chance for bitterness, so I would not recommend leaving it in the water for a long time.<br /><br />Another recommendation is Adagio's Irish Breakfast (which I slightly prefer) but both teas are standouts!"
"Why am I just learning about these?  They are delicious.<br /><br />Enough in each individual bag for 2 people to share.<br /><br />Low cal, low fat, but not low flavor.  Highly recommend.<br /><br />Will be back for more."
I like Kettle chips but was really disappointed with this order because they were over cooked.  I bought a bigger sized bag from Costco and the chips were all cooked perfectly. So I don't know why these were different.<br />Will never buy these chips from here again.
"This product is Dark Chocolate Not milk chocolate! To the people who can't drink milk this is Great ,the reason it's great is because it is one on the original chocolate candy formula's .Originally All chocolate was dark chocolate ,There was no milk chocolate ,without milk and lactose being used as a filler the normal chocolate had 85 to 90% chocolate solids per volume .<br /><br />Milk was added by the Swiss and used as a filler .Way back in the 1880's they found that when you combine milk with chocolate you could reduced the chocolate content in the candy .Milk chocolate was sold as a less expensive form of chocolate because the manufacturers like Hershey could sell a chocolate with 25% Cocoa content for a low price and still make a huge proffit as the could make 3 to 6 cheap candy bars by reducing the Cocoa in each bar .<br /><br />So in America we eat cheap chocolate because we see it as the normal type of chocolate candy. This product is Bitter sweet Dark chocolate and is very dense not waxy like a Hershey candy bar .<br /><br />To the High end consumer this is the Same grade as expensive Belgian Chocolate if sold as a Bitter sweet Dark chocolate,This product does not normally contain Whole milk ,Milk solids,Lactose, calcium extenders,Milk protein or Animal by products such as animal fat,animal derived protein or bulk extenders which alter the favor of real chocolate<br /><br />While this product may contain  a minimum of 40% Cocoa solids(the main favoring and ingredient in chocolate)It is the best chocolate product produced in Poland and A true value to chocolate lovers Any where!"
"I'm really disappointed with the changes in quality -- it's not even the same product that we used to love.  A couple of years ago, the product was consistently fantastic, but now the taste, quality of the meat, and freshness are hit or miss...and recently it's all been a miss."
Love this brand. Great price with save and subscribe. My husband loves them. Top with whipped cream in a can and I have a happy man. I wish you could buy all pepermint cocoa.
"For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing.<br /><br />Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat.  I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue.  Gatorade wasn't an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a low-carb alternative.  The ""zero carb"" sports drinks didn't help so what to do?  One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them.....voila!...problem solved!!<br /><br />I've shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these.<br /><br />These guys got it right -- they are superbly formulated and simply work....."
"I had high hopes when I ordered this tea, as years ago in San Francisco I used to buy a lovely rose black in Chinatown which was my favorite tea ever. Unfortunately, this blend lacks body and is very high in caffeine. I prefer the opposite, a full-bodied tea I can brew strong without sending my blood pressure through the roof.  But for someone who wants a light tasting tea with a powerful caffeine punch, this might be a good choice."
"This is my new favorite herbal tea. It has awesome flavor. By adding a couple drops of stevia sweetener, this makes a great ""treat"" to sooth my sweet-tooth without negatively impacting a diet."
"I am somewhat of a mac and cheese connoisseur.  This stuff is good.  I like the fact that it's whole grain, too."
"The best thing that I look foreward to every morning . It makes my day ,the best tasting coffee ever"
What else can I say? No other candy bar has this great taste of divine chocolate with the perfect combination of raisins and nuts. A favorite of mine since a little girl. Arrived fine when I bought them but watch out for hot weather deliveries.
"i tried bahlsen chocolates in europe, but you can't find them very often in the states. these are unlike any usa chocolates i've eaten, the wafer is wrapped over itself 4-5 times. you can't beat the crunch these make, delicious."
"I ordered this product because of a good price deal.  Amazon shipped accordingly, absolutely no problems there.  However, the taste of this product was horrendous.  It tasted as if someone through chemicals in a cup and told me to brew it.  I personally will go back to buying Swiss Miss in a can and just using the Keurig to give me Hot Water, cheaper and much better tasting."
"This is a great product... my baby loves it. I especially like the smooth liquid formula versus the powder since the powder never seems to dissolve properly.<br /><br />I am, however, rating this low because of the SELLER... $55 is RIDICULOUS! This product normally sells for $25-$32. But they are jacking up the price because there is a shortage of the liquid formula due to the powder recall.<br /><br />YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED AMAZON!!!! This is food for a BABY! Makes me ill."
"The Ingredients aren't from Nantucket, the blend is not smooth. Too heavy  or something maybe too much arabica.<br /><br />then today I learn Green Mountain Coffee is involved with this:<br />Burlington, Vermont - October 25, 2010<br /><br />Could a routine inquiry into accounting practices at Green Mountain Coffee Roasters lead to an insider trading investigation? A Wall Street whistleblower believes it's possible after reviewing documents from the Securities Exchange Commission.<br /><br />The SEC is already conducting an informal inquiry into Green Mountain's ""revenue recognition practices."" And now Sam Antar, a securities expert who has worked with federal investigators, says public documents show a company executive sold thousands of shares just before the company publicly disclosed the SEC inquiry. The announcement of the inquiry was followed by a 16-percent drop in Green Mountain's stock price.<br /><br />A group of shareholders are already suing the company, alleging executives artificially inflated the stock price and cashed in before the price drop. And Antar says the timing of the stock sale is the kind of thing that could trigger an insider trading investigation.<br /><br />Not recommending this at all. Try the Donut Shop Kuerig Coffee its a lot better blend.."
"I am not the type that ever writes reviews, especially for the internet, but Pop Chips are the best  ""potato chips"" that I have ever had -- so much so that I have to limit myself to one bag per week!  A friend introduced Pop Chips to me and I immediately told her that I hated her because they are so good, they are irrisistable.  I purchased a box of 12 to be delivered every three months so that I can limit myself to one bag per week ... otherwise, I would absolutely be in trouble.<br /><br />Believe me, you have to try these chips!"
"This is mostly concentrated apple and grape juice reconstituted with carbonated water; it's extremely sweet and more caloric than soda.  Do people who consume this think they're drinking something healthy, or indulging in liquid candy?  Or is this supposed to be used as a mixer, e.g., for making daiquiris?"
This coffee brews very weak - like a light roast.  W.P. Chef's reserve pods are just over half full.  Put pod on scale and it's 15% less coffee wgt than normal pods.  Stick with normal pods or extra bold if you like coffee that taste like coffee.
"These apple chips are great tasting, low calorie treats!  We got hooked on these at Costco, then they stopped carrying them.  Happy to find them on Amazon so we can get them whenever we want them!"
"This device does one thing and it does it well. I use it to record demos and it provides a crisp, clean sound with zero noise! I have read some reviews where people complain about the durability of the icicle. While it feels a little chinsy, I hardly think it will snap in half. The price is right and the sound is great.<br /><br />For the most part, setting the icicle up is incredibly easy. I had a few instances where I had to reboot for Windows to recognize it again and such, but no serious headaches.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great device to have on hand of for the traveling musician who wants to quickly lay down ideas on the road."
"I didn't know what to expect when I ordered this, but I was more than pleasantly surprised.  It tastes like regular French Roast Coffee, but it's easier on your stomach.  Suffering from acid reflux disease myself, I can see that there would be extra benefit to drinking this brew.  I love my coffee and don't want to give it up.  If regular coffee upsets your stomach with reflux, you should give this product a whirl--I think you'll be pleasantly surprised."
We are trying to grow all our own food and this sprout is a good addition for our dietary needs. Great price for Organic as well.
"One star given just for possibility that some cats out there may be less (or different) picky from ours.  See my review of CAT-MAN-DOO BONITO SPRINKLES for info on several products I ""tested"" in search of a flavor/appetite enhancer, including this shrimp version and another F&S tuna treat product that was much better received by our gang of four."
"Please be aware that although dogs absolutely LOVE these treats, that they may have caused a recent unexplainable illness in our 9 month old Mastiff pup. He was getting 1 or 2 a day of these chicken jerky's for about a week and then suddenly became very lethargic, along with vomiting, diarrhea, and had no appetite ""except"" he would eat only these treats and drink water. Vet thinks he'll recover OK, but advised us to stop feeding them to our dogs. These are still ""Made in China"" and in 2007 reports had shown that dogs were getting sick from these and other brands, and there are still reported cases today. Just be careful and watch your pets closely if you are feeding them these. We will no longer feed these to any of our dogs, ever. Wish Dogswell would manufacturer these in the USA again."
I've been using Worthing products for most of my life and they are great. This is a very good deal.
"When I saw the ingredients on this box I knew it would be a disappointment. It would be much better and pretty easy just to make your own mix. Also, there are plenty of other quality mixes out there like Pamela's and Bob's Red Mill. This will be a huge disappointment to you so don't waste your money."
I can't even give this any stars.  Nastiest stuff on earth!  Tastes like chemicals and medicine with carbination!  Will never order it again!
"I ordered the Deluxe 6oz Red Popcorn Maker Machine by Paramount Entertainment and as an accompaniment I also ordered the Great Northern Popcorn, 6-Ounce Portion Packs (24 pack). The popcorn maker I like very much but the Great Northern Popcorn is terrible. The flavor isn't all that bad but only 2 ounces of the 6 oz package pop. With one pack, I thought I would give extra time but the unpopped kernels just burned, they never popped. The package itself is hard to use and I needed to cut it apart with a scissor before I could use it. Also, and this is the worst, one 6oz package has 900 calories. I usually eat popcorn as a low calorie treat but not this stuff. One person will end up eating the amount that pops and with the calories being in the grease package, all of the grease calories are put on the 2oz that pop. The last few packages I popped, I fed it to my dogs (which usually love popcorn). They had a few bites than left it alone. My solution - off the shelf popcorn with 3oz of canola oil and some sea salt - ¼ the calories, 90% kernel pop and much better flavor."
"This item, WERTHER'S SUGAR FREE HARD CANDY, if consumed, will give you - or your friends, loose bowels. I purchased 12 bags and discovered more than a bowel problem: You can't return them. Need a laxative? I have ten unopened bags you can have - for free."
"I have an older Newfie and he has had skin problems most of his life.  Unfortunately, he is also a very picky eater, so finding a balance between what he will eat and what is good for him has been tricky.  He really likes this food!  Finally, my worried mom's heart can rest.  His skin issues are clearing and he doesn't scratch like he wants to peel off his skin.  I highly recommend if your dog shares these issues... get this food, mix it with some sensitive skin wet food or even salmon... your dog with thank you!"
"I opened the box to find a huge mess of chocolate all over the tray. Chocolate was no better than Hershey's and worst of all, it is imported from Hong Kong. I don't care to eat food made in China after all their countless product safety issues. Look elsewhere"
"I did not hold out much hope for this product. We have two pedigree Persian cats, and they are as finicky eaters as any cats alive. My wife and I have tried all kinds of different wet and dry foods, but our cats usually just turn up their noses and look at us like we're stupid, until we give them something we know they like. So, when this arrived and I opened the chicken pot pie to see it was full of chunks of chicken and carrot (and something else, potato maybe) in what looked like chicken soup, I braced myself for packing up the remainder and donating it to the local animal shelter...but, NO! Both of our cats dug right in. Both ate up all the soup, and one cleared his bowl. The other left the larger chunks of chicken and all the veggies (he never eats veggies). For our cats, that's a rave review. The second kind, shredded chicken in sesame sauce, they didn't like as much, but they still cleared out all the liquid and a good portion of the chicken. Honestly, I was very pleasantly surprised they ate as much of the new stuff as they did. It must be good. For us, these single serving size cans are perfect, because we can split one between the two cats (they don't eat much), or give half in the morning and half in the evening, so it comes in quantities our pets are comfortable with. Also, packaging two kinds in one box is helpful, as our cats also thrive on variety. Because our cats did not eat it down to the bowl like they would their current favorites, I can't give the product five stars, but I do give this product a hearty four and half stars, and I think we are likely to buy this brand in the future if its price is competitive with our cats' current favorites."
"I was very excited about this purchase until I tried this truffle.<br />These were horrible.  Maybe I got the worst bottle they have ever sold and I just happened to get them.  But, these are bad.  If you want to eat the root of a dirty old root of a tree, you will enjoy these.  If you doubt my credibility of my review, please feel free to read my other reviews.  Please don't waste your money.  My wife tried these and couldn't even believe these could be called truffles."
I used quotes around the word tea because I doubt that the bags contain tea.  I wouldn't be surprised if the bags contained ground up sticks instead of tea.  I would not give this product a single star; it deserves zero stars in my opinion.<br />This tool is not allowing me to continue without giving the product at least one star.
"I've always had trouble getting my dogs to eat dry dog food.  I had ordered a small bag of the potato, chicken & blueberry just to keep on hand just in case.  Well, my dog got sick and would not eat his regular food.  We tried everything.  We opened the bag of First Mate, and he ate the whole bowl!  He's been eating it ever since, and I'm totally amazed.<br />It works!!!"
"This is good stuff, of which I have consumed an absurd amount. I keep some of these brownies in the freezer at all times, for serving guests, or for having a little something sweet myself when I come home from an event where everyone but me (all the non-celiacs) have been snarfing down the cake or cookies and I have had . . . coffee.<br /><br />The first time I used this mix, I made the butter recipe, because I had always cooked with butter and was afraid it wouldn't taste good without butter. But the next time, I was in a hurry and didn't want to bother melting butter, so I made the oil version with canola oil, and it tasted just as good. And it's better for you. So that's what I make. I usually add half a cup of Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate chips. The flavor of the dough has a subtle richness that I think comes from being sweetened mostly with mollasses and honey. As with all brownies, don't over cook.<br /><br />I often make this to take to potlucks or other events that require ""something to share,"" because it's easy and quick and everyone who likes chocolate likes these brownies. They are very moist and rich; I cut them into very small squares. Unfortunately, they taste great right out of the freezer; otherwise they would last longer and I would weigh less."
"I like that these are organic dog treats.  It is amazing how different types of food can really upset your dogs, especially when they get older.  I also like that they don't stink like bacon.  They have no strong odor, and my dogs really enjoy them.  A lot of people say that they are not for small dogs, and I would agree.  These are more for medium to large dogs.  We have a larger Shih-tzu that liked them and did fine, but maybe even if they were a different shape then the small dogs would do better.  They are currently a large, hard rectangle that can be broken into 2 smaller squares. When the smaller dogs try to eat them, they make a bit of a mess.<br /><br />Even with the size/shape limitations, both of my dogs loved them and ate them right up.  And I would mention that our Shih-tzu is super picky.  I would definitely buy these for my dogs."
"This tea was not what I expected.  I love cinnamon tea and was very disappointed with this product.  The tea does not have a strong cinnamon flavor which I enjoy.  This tea has a stronger Rooibos flavor than cinnamon flavor.  Furthermore, I found that the product description does not give a full list of the tea's ingredients.<br /><br />The ingredients listed on the box include:  Cinnamon, Licorice Root, Orange Peel, Indian Sarsaparilla, Chicory Root, Rooibos, Natural Flavors, Star Anise, Almond Extract and Locorice Extract"
"If you plan on making a pitcher of tea, forget it, it takes 4 packs for 64 oz and is still very, very weak, and it must be consumed in 12 hours (so they say) so you're much better off brewing your own.<br /><br />However if you're idea is to ""stash"" this in your purse (for the ladies) or pocket (for men which would be weird) it's just okay.  One packet does little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHo drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature?  Also, with only 8 packets (the raspberry pom) in a box, that gives you 4 16 oz drinks for $3.  Not sure it's worth it at all, I'd rather drink lemon water when out than this, equally as bland but free."
I guess everyone's taste buds are different.  This product didn't work for me.  Every food item tasted as it should :-(
"I normally order 2 pounds a month from this company, so that should apeak for itself.  For reasons unknown, I only ordered 1 pound this last time (12/7/11. This was my only stroke of good luck, for I received a bag of rancid nuts! They had a chemical taste, and I think it would have been nice if someone tasted one before shipping it out.I had to dispose of them in the trash, fearing my squirrel friend would suffer dire consequences, were he to eat one! Nuff said!Note: I just made a mistake on this order! Same company, but a later order that was for only one pound, not the 2 pound order of 12/7! That 2 pound order was fine. The next order was the bad one!"
"These dog treats smell so awful but your puppy/dog will be the happiest you've ever seen in your life. If you ever find yourself annoyed with your puppy because he/she just wants to play, play, play... give em one of these little things and you will not hear a peep for hours! They are kind of messy, so be sure you give one to your puppy in a safe area. And of course, always keep a close eye on him/her when they have one because there are bones in these!"
"This is a great price, and easy way to purchase powdered goats milk.  The cheapest I've found, and the quickest shipping I've ever experienced from Amazon."
"I am an avid tea drinker and have tried so many teas, both loose teas and bagged teas, looking for the perfect cup of Earl Grey.  Rishi hit the ball out of the park with this one.  The flavor is strong and full, but still sweet and comforting.  It is not as bitter or as harsh as many other Earl Greys.  It has a fresh taste and smell.  The tea is superbly balanced and tastes as if there is more to it than tea leaves and water.<br /><br />To compare to some other teas, to give you a better picture of what I mean, it is a fuller flavor than Bigelow, Twinnings, or Ahmad, while being not as delicate as Numi.  It does not have the synthetic taste and smell of Stash.  It is not quite as pungent and bitter as Tazo (which I do like).  Mostly, it compares to Teavana's Earl Grey Creme, which I also highly recommend, but is a more robust flavor, with less of the creamy mouth-feel.  I highly recommend this tea."
I sent a box to my son who is stationed in Kabul Afghanistan.  He was thrilled to get it and really enjoyed it. He shared some with his fellow soldiers and now they want more!!
"My three dogs like these treats, including my picky Chihuahua.  That's saying something right there!  These treats are fairly large, measuring approx. 2"" x 1"".  I have observed that they are very crumbly when eaten.  Each treat has a score line in the middle, which when broken, make two 1"" x 1"" squares for smaller dogs like my Chihuahua.  My dogs all enjoy them.<br /><br />Ingredients (from the packet): ""Organic Barley, Organic Lamb, Organic Carrots, Organic Apples, Organic Palm Oil (Preserved with Mixed Tocopherois, a source of Vitamin E), Organic Molasses.""<br /><br />These treats are certified Organic by the USDA.  They contain no wheat or corn, just organic barley.  They are a ""Product of New Zealand."""
Greenies (96) were received quickly in a protective box. They were fresh in a resealable bag. I would order from vendor again.
Shipped very fast.  Great product for your dog's teeth.  I have been giving my poodle greenies ofr years now and my vet said that her teeth are just as white and healthy as a 2 year old dogs.  She is 10 years old.
"I bought this popcorn to use in my whirley pop and it pops up perfectly.  The taste is wonderful. I liked it so much I decided to have it shipped automatically.  If you want popcorn like they serve in the movie theater, buy this!  Wished I had some right now!!!"
"When i got it, was in amazing condition, only problem is it died due to the fact bugs { nats & flies } Love this for some odd reason. But all n all, love the plant! Will buy from seller again."
"I bought them for a friend because she loves the cherry ones and they're hard to find. I kept half for myself. I admit, gone in no time."
"A coffee drinker for 50 years, this is the best decaf I've ever had. It's fantastic. Can't understand why anyone would brew and drink anything else. Just plain good decaf, and it's low acid too! Fabulous."
"Seems very weak.  I must be honest, I ordered the wrong coffee.  I was sad. This isn't bad as a base for an iced coffee."
"I've tried other flavors of Switch carbonated juice drinks and have enjoyed them. However, this particular flavor of orange tangerine was way too sweet. I felt like I was drinking some sort of carbonated orange ade drink and could barely get it down. While I would probably purchase the other flavors of Switch, I definitely would not purchase this one."
This jerky is extremely addictive!  I have had most every other brand of jerky and this is by far the best jerky I have ever had.  It was originally King B Jerky.
"I absolutely love Pop Chips.  Cheddar is my favorite, but I thought I'd try these cause I like Parmesan too.  Just a word of caution....you'd better like garlic if you buy these because the garlic flavor definitely overwhelms the Parmesan flavor. All in all, these are great chips if you're watching your weight.  They are crispy and flavorful and much lower calories than regular chips."
My dogs love the biscuits but too bad most times all they get are small pieces. Calls to the company get a useless answer of not their fault. Obviously bad quality control.
"These were nasty, they were so greasy and too rich for my blood, plus they lacked major flavor, no spicy jalapeno flavor at all.  I was so dissapointed in these chips, I am always hearing great things about these chips but I am telling you, yuck yuck yuck.  Give me pain chips any day.  Maybe there is a better kettle chip brand out there but I am staying clear from these chips. I wish I could give these zero stars if I could."
"This was ordered accidentally, but I accepted it anyway.  I (and my family) am very glad I did.  It was delicious.  I will definitely order this and other products from them again."
"It is not fair to say I give this product one star as I haven't even tried it, but the label states that it has ""hint of heat from chiles"" in it. I can not eat anything with chile in it and would not have ordered it if it had been indicated on the web site. If you like a bit of heat you may love this and give it a 5star rating, just be aware."
"I wasted my money.  I tried putting different cereal, dog foods, etc. in this, and my dog ignores it completely."
"I'm used to cheap tea (by the way, cheap tea isn't low quality), but this one's awful. It tastes like very spicy water.. water with Tabasco added, essentially. Although I did steep the tea bag for about four minutes, there was no depth to the flavor. I finished the cup, but I certainly wouldn't buy it."
"I prefer handcooked (read fried) peanuts to dry roasted and these are very good. however, they are not as fresh and bright-tasting as Whitley's peanuts which are not sold on Amazon at the moment, but can be found at gourmet shops. You would think they would be the same, both being from Williamsburg and all."
"My first box came with some of the packets opened and they were all sticky.  I contacted you and the recieved another box free.  They were packed much better, and arrived intact.  Thank you so much.  We love these!!"
I drink my coffee with a splash of half-and-half.  Other hazelnut k-cups are too bland for me.  I much prefer Wolfgang Puck's excellent rich roast with definite -- but not overpowering -- hazelnut flavor.
Lacks the flavor I was hoping for and the price was a bit high for the satisfaction level.  I won't be ordering this again.  Live and learn.
"It could be worse. The pineapple, which is not well-advertised on the package, is actually the best part. The worst part is the large discs of... Turnip? I'm not even sure. Sauce is bland. Pass it up, go with the BBQ chicken or zesty marinara."
This cinnamon cake loaf has a wonderful natural flavor.  It's moist and tender and a great little sweet treat when you want something that isn't terribly bad for your diet.  It's delicious!
"I love these Barbecue flavored Pop Chips. They're crunchy, loaded with spicy Barbecue flavor, and highly addicting. Beware... you're going to want more! After trying these you'll find it hard to believe they're pretty healthy. Go to their website and see for yourself (not every product page lists ingredients, it's worth checking it out). I'll definitely be buying more of these.<br /><br />4 stars instead of 5 because although they're absolutely delicious, they're also inconsistent. One bag has different textured chips (and coating variances, mainly color difference) from another. That's fine with me but it's just a a little off putting."
"It was time to order cat food again and I thought I'd give the Natural Balance line a try.  My cat loves fish, so I figured that the Tuna and Shrimp Recipe would be a big hit.  Nope.  Both cats in our house gave it two thumbs down votes - neither of them would touch it.  What finicky little critters they can be sometimes [sigh]."
"GREAT TASTING, WHOLESOME GOODNESS AT A FAIR PRICE!! I PUT THESE LITTLE SEEDS ON EVERYTHING! CHIA HAS A N EXCELLENT SHELF LIFE AND NAVITAS PACKAGES THEIR PRODUCT IN A RESEALABLE BAG TO ENSURE FRESHNESS!!"
Very tasty gluten-free option.  My kids loved it as it wasn't too spicy.
"I bought this because I had been seeing this pod in magazines and other places. I thought it would be a great addition to my fridge to save money on cilantro. However, this is very poorly designed. I could not open it whats-or-ever, even after searching through reviews after reviews. Finally, my genius boyfriend found the solution! Basically, you will need to open it from the BOTTOM. You will need to squeeze the two sides next to the cap in order to open it. You will have to be careful when you are opening or closing it while there's water in the pot. If any one who is reading this still having problem opening it. Let me know. I'll try to explain it better there. But anyway, this is a pretty useless product for its productivity, but a bit more useful if you are too lazy to make your own, and wants a prettier fridge. You can make you own with a cup (or any container) filled with a bit of water and wrapped in plastic bag with the herb....(so unless you have money to waste, don't buy this useless pot)."
"After searching many local stores to find this product I ordered it via Amazon.  I took the advice of other reviewers & ordered the 3 pack.  I've only made pancakes w/ it, but they are delicious.  Some complain that they are bland.  I always add a little something to flavor my pancakes.  A few drops of vanilla & a sprinkle of cinnamon had these pancakes tasting wonderful!  My 2 yr old loved them.  I highly recommend you try the GF Bisquick."
"Unless you like salt vinegar chips as salty as eating actual pinches of salt and drinking actual vinegar, i doubt you will like these chips.  These are the saltiest & sourest chips I have ever had, and the only reason stops me from throwing these away is because I paid for 2 full boxes and dont like to waste food.  The brown chips are especially bad, besides being salty and sour, they also taste overcooked and burnt.  Unless you are the rare kind that can take this kind of extreme taste, you will not like these chips.<br /><br />I actually have a high tolerance for sour taste, so I can down a bag of chips with a bit of difficulty.  But normal people, please do not try this at home."
"Originally, these were made in US. Now made in China ( see back of bag) ... advertised as natural,cage free, no hormones, no fillers, no antibiotics ...HUH? Not in China... I will not trust these as safe treats. Follow up:  My dogs vomited after they ate these. 3/09 original warnings from FDA 2007 re: chicken product from China... a follow up was issued by the FDA again on 12/18/08 to remain vigilant and of concern if fed to smaller dogs.<br /><br />Update: DEC 2011 All chicken Jerky remains a problem according to the FDA (product from China noted again to be of concern)<br />Some dogs made ill from chicken jerky product recovered with treatment and others have died.<br />The email from my vet stated that the FDA would like you to report if you have a problem with chicken jerky treats."
"I wanted a new challenge for my terrier, and she figured this out in no time flat.  Then she ran off with the compartment covers and chewed them to bits.  So, the product is not challenging and not robust.  Maybe this would work for a declawed cat, but if your dog is halfway on the ball, get something else."
"I credit my 11 1/2 year old golden retriever's continued good health to Dr. Harvey's Canine Health.  I have been feeding Cleo this food for 11 years after searching for something to relieve her puppy allergies.  If I run out and feed her something else, her personality changes and she gets ""ouchy"".<br />I can't recommend this product enough!"
love to order my coffee on amazon.  easy and shows up quickly.<br />This k cup is great coffee.  dcaf is very good as well
"This is a very good tea as far as teabags go...traditionally loose tea is always better quality than teabag teas, But this is the exception...being organic as well as the least processed compared to other teas(White tea is the least processed of all teas)...teabags impart a subtle paper flavor that loose teas are free of...these bags are a cut above other teabagged teas(the subtle teabag flavor is less of a factor in this instance)... and are an excellent choice in leu of saving money...It took about six weeks to finally get delivered, but it was worth the weight...This one is a no brainer...!!!"
"This salsa was delicious. It was very spicy as I'm sure you've guessed, but was also pretty dang tasty. It was a bit sweeter than I prefer my salsa and given the price I don't think it is something I would eat with any frequency but definately worth the novelty and if sweet and spicy salsas are your thing, you just might end up loving it!"
"I got disgusted with the garlic powder sold in bulk at health food stores and natural food groceries.  It rarely has much garlic flavor and was way too hot and the quality was very inconsistent at stores that did sometimes sell something good.<br /><br />I'm now half way through my second jar of Tone's, which is consistently excellent.  It has a strong garlic flavor and is not hot unless you use a lot on something like broccoli.  It is way better than raw garlic cloves.  They must have an excellent source of garlic for their powder.  If you have doubts about your current garlic powder, smell it.  If it doesn't have a strong garlic smell, it's just white powder.  Get this Tone's and you'll get your delicious food back."
"I love sorghum flour.  It's mild in flavor and smell, it's easily mixed into flour blends for gluten free baking too.  It's one of my favorites along with millet, sweet rice, coconut and almond."
"I'm of Russian descent and have been eating buckwheat for my entire life. I live in the US and usually buy buckwheat in local Russian or Eastern European stores. This is the first (and last) time I tried American-made buckwheat. Here are things that I found.<br /> 1. It takes only 10-12 min to cook this. Normally, it takes 25-30 min. And this item is not branded as an ""instant buckwheat""<br /> 2. It tastes quite different than ""usual""<br /> 3. There is a strong metallic smell<br /> 4. This item is overpriced. Just go to the closest Russian or Eastern European shop and buy the same thing 4 times cheaper."
"Awful, Awful, Awful!  I like a lighter roast and I really love french vanilla so I was thrilled to find this one.  With the first sip I was highly disappointed.  It has a very strong artificial flavor that doesn't taste anything like french vanilla and it certainly doesn't taste like coffee.  Like one other reviewer said, I'll probably just toss it in the trash and throw that money away because I don't know anybody who would enjoy it.  YUK!"
"This is a great salt; it has a wholesome flavor and, I noticed it doesn't make you thirsty or rise the blood pressure as regular salt does. That's the benefit of the natural balance of minerals in it. I would recommend this to friends and health conscious people."
Been buying greenies for years.  Decide to try the senior version but it made my dog sick.  I don't know if its to soft or what but it seemed to get stuck in his throat that he'd eat some grass to throw it up.  Bummed since I bought a tub.
"Popchips are ok.  However, these snacks are made from potato flakes, similar to ""Pringles"".  If you have ever eaten ""Funyuns"" the onion flavored rings made by Frito Lay you have already tasted pretty much what Popchips taste like, just without the onion flavoring.  If your not concerned with calories, but simply want the best potato chip you can buy, try ""Grandma Utz"" potato chips, a true potato chip."
"I ordered this pasta because I thought my children would love the animal shapes. Since I am the only GlutenFree in our home, I try to find FUN things for the entire family instead of making 2 separate meals. When I served this at dinner the other night, my husband's expression said it all! He followed his surprised look with ""Now This is Pasta!"" We could not believe how good this pasta was. We are now hooked! I can not wait to try some more of the OrgraN products."
"I am still trying to find the perfect bean for making espresso. This is probably the closest I have come yet, at least to making espresso shots for lattes and cappuccinos. I have used the crema e aroma and the Supercrema. I like the Supercrema a lot, and this is very similar, but in my hands came out a little more smooth and a little less bitter. I grind with a LeLit Pl53 and brew on a Rancilio Silvia. My final verdict is that these shots are smooth enough to make milk-based drinks that need little-to no sweetener, as the shots (done properly) have very little or no bitterness. As far as drinking them as straight espresso, I would still like a little more body to each shot and maybe a little more complexity. However, as I am constantly refining my brew methods, it would not surprise me at all if I was still not reaching the full potential of these beans. Delicious!"
"Just small enough, but not too big for my dog. He loves it and it helps keep his teeth clean."
My cocker puppy 4 mos threw up castor and poullex and Natural balance and had loose motions. SO i tried this and he did great ! even the red streaking from his eyes have almost cleared up after a month along with similasan eye drops. which is great.
"A few years ago, my wife was on a new medication that would make her sick all the time.  We were on vacation and she was in our room throwing up all day.  I walked over to the Whole Foods next door to see if I could find anything that might make her feel any better, when I stumbled upon this while just looking around the tea aisle.  I'm not really much of a natural remedies kind of guy and don't worship crystals... but this just seemed to be too much of a coincidence.  I had to try...!  I made her some back at the room and she felt much better in just a few minutes!  Over the following months, I would make her a cup whenever she was feeling badly.  It really worked!<br /><br />Later, over the years, we recommended or gave this to friends and acquaintances struggling with nausea.  We gave it to one lady who was pregnant and having awful morning sickness.  It worked so well for her, she went right out and bought her own supply!<br /><br />This week, my wife is sick again and we ran out. I couldn't find any locally!  I checked Amazon and found this six pack to be way cheaper then the $4.99 per box I typically would pay.  It arrived quickly and my wife is feeling much better."
I love Rosarita Refried Beans.  I grew up in Mesa Az where these beans were manufactured (at least a long time ago) and I have always thought they were the best on the market.  I can't always find them on the east coast so when I saw them available through Amazon I was thrilled.  They have a smooth texture and subtle taste so they can be used in any recipe.
"I like the idea of a low-acid, but not decaf coffee, because I love coffee, but have been absolutely flattened before by acid-induced stomach pain (and GAWD forbid I give up my cup of coffee in the morning!).  But I'm not a fan of the Puroast Low Acid Coffee, French Roast.  It leaves a funny taste in my mouth that I can't quite identify, and I tried this coffee black, with sugar, with sugar and skim milk.  That unidentifiable funny taste was still there.  As I've never tried a ""low-acid"" coffee before trying this product, I don't know whether to pin it on Puroast as a brand, as something they do with their beans, or if the strange taste is a trade-off in low-acid coffee.  In the days since trying this coffee, I've had other brands/kinds of coffee and have not had that weird taste, so I don't think it's me.  Your experience could be different, but I'm not a fan of this one."
"Guys - can't call it coconut water if the the product contains sugar.  That beverage would than be JUICE. After yoga, I went to Whole Foods to pick up dinner and to hydrate. I thought this could be a good one - the minute I tasted it I KNEW it! Sugar. Gross. Kinda the last thing I wanted to put in my body after a bikram session."
"My sister and I are gluten intolerant.  Pamela's bread mix is very good tasting, moist and we enjoy it better than any bread mixes we have tried.  We are able to save a lot of money by purchasing by case lot through Amazon.  Thanks."
The claim that this is the best vanilla flavored coffee I have ever had is JUST NOT SO.  This product does not even taste like good coffee.  It does not smell like vanilla and does not even taste like coffee.  It is overpriced and terrible as far as I am concerned.
"I found Dogswell products 7 years ago when my vet recommended the Glucosa-Chondro chicken strips to help my dog who had just had patella luxation surgery on both his knees. The vet said the supplements would help my little one avoid arthritis in his later years. I'd say so! He's pushing 8.5 yo and doesn't show any signs of slowing down even though he has pins in both knees. He jumps high, runs like a maniac and is spry as a pup. Between this and various other dogswell treats that care for his eyes, hair, coat, breath, teeth, etc, he's going strong which makes momma very happy. All in all, I love these products and recommend them to all my friends who have dogs."
"I use all sorts of K-Cups, but this breakfast blend is definately my Go-To blend!! It is perfect - not too light, not too dark. I highly recommend this, as the price for the 50-count box is pretty good!!"
"I have been using this product for 5+ years and have enjoyed it much.  I sometimes will mix in chopped hot dogs or sausage for variety.  Spicy sausage works well.  The main complaint I have is the amount of salt they put in the mix.  I can almost smell the salt!  Unfortunately they do not have the reduced sodium version where I live so I will try to order it online.  Overall, it's very flavorful but too salty.  It's much more flavorful than the similar Goya product."
I have ordered my Pop Chips from Amazon for months. The last boxful was nasty. My whole family agreed and we threw them out. They tasted old and rancid. I wrote this to Amazon and never heard a word back about it. I just cancelled my regular delivery.
"Excellent Customer Service, Quick Ship, VERY well packed merchandise. My new supplier of all things HOT!."
My husband has been looking for this product in the store and it is nowhere to be found. He is a happy camper.
"Been gluten free for 7 years now. Thought we were done with mixes that tasted awful.  We threw it away because we did not like it. For my money, you can't beat Pamela's baking mix. But, the Betty Crocker chocolate chips are the BEST! So, don't give up Betty Crocker, just work on this one!"
"I didnt like these, ended up throwing them away because I thought I was getting more of a chocolate fix out of them than a healthy snack. The berries were dry and crispy - I was expecting maybe a little chewy like a small raisin or something."
"While this mix is pretty pricey to end up with a small pan of brownies, they do have a great taste!  I love that they have alternative recipes on the package.  We have egg allergies, so I use the egg-free recipe.  I have to cook it for significantly longer than the recipe states, (10+ mins.), and still the brownies are pretty gooey and don't hold together.  OK to eat at home, but not good enough to take anywhere.  Again, they taste great, especially for a chocolate and sweets deprived pregnant woman :)"
"If you like fresh popcorn from a kettle, and you aren't completely satisfied with the microwave stuff, this is the popcorn for you!!!  It tastes great and it comes conveniently packaged for smaller kettles. I have a 2.5 ounce kettle, and this premeasured bag makes the perfect amount. No measuring, no guessing, just great tasting, easy to make popcorn. I'm definitely going to buy this stuff again."
These remind of a product called Munchos that I liked a long time ago in regards to flavor. Great crunch and salt level. I wish they packages a bit bigger than the 0.8 and smaller than 3 oz.  The 0.8 isnt quite enough and the 3 is too much. About 1.5 oz would be right for my appetite.
I love this coffee but I am not sure what has happened to the price lately I used to get this exact product on average for about 15 dollars and the price has skyrocketed to $40.  I am hesitant to buy this product again for this price
"This bread mix definitly lives up to it's name.  It is really easy to make in a bread machine, oven or even as dinner rolls.  We used to use a couple of other brands, but this is all we buy now.  Even the non-celiacs in our family love it."
"I have tried many brands and this is the best. Pappardelle is not too sticky and not too flimsy.  Holds up nicely with a dense sauce.  You could easily pass this off as ""your own homemade"". When I serve it people always want to know more about the pasta. It makes a great hostess gift,(so much better than a scented candle)!"
"If you plan on making a pitcher of tea, forget it, it takes 4 packs for 64 oz and is still very, very weak, and it must be consumed in 12 hours (so they say) so you're much better off brewing your own.<br /><br />However if you're idea is to ""stash"" this in your purse (for the ladies) or pocket (for men which would be weird) it's just okay.  One packet does little for flavor with 16 oz of water so you'd have to use two, and WHo drinks just 16 oz of water when out to eat or something of that nature?  Also, with only 8 packets (the raspberry pom) in a box, that gives you 4 16 oz drinks for $3.  Not sure it's worth it at all, I'd rather drink lemon water when out than this, equally as bland but free."
"i'm a big fan of hodgson mill products (we love their bread mixes, i use their pancake mixes.) i'm not afraid of whole grains  (i mill my own grains, wheat, kamut, rye, barley) and i even put milled flax seed in my (home made) yogurt. I've been a baker for 35 years and love to try new recipes.<br /><br />i had high expectations for this product but was very disappointed by the results: the box calls for too much fat and the baked brownies have a distinctly oily feel in the mouth.  I can enjoy the grittiness and the chocolate flavor is fine but i would caution buyers against the results if following the instructions on the box<br /><br />one of the problems is that the coarse texture of the mix does not allow the fat to be absorbed well.<br /><br />i will go back to making whole wheat brownies from scratch.  a little bit of time required... a little less convenient but brownies being a treat (and comfort food), the texture should be right :)"
"This is the first K-cup and Tea product from Twinings that no one enjoyed in our family. If I could have returned it, I would have after the first cup, but this item is not returnable."
The Green Mountain Nantucket Blend K-Cup portion pack for Keurig is a great coffee and everything is fresh and packaged nicely.
"As others have said this drink is 100% natural and contains none of the things that we don't want in soda.  My family really enjoyed it.  I thought it had a great bubbly and fruity taste.  None of us found it overly sweet.  We're not big soda drinkers, but this would be fun on a hot day as something different."
"After trying many of the other hot cocoa k-cup options, I find that the Grove Square product tastes the best.  For my personal taste, I find that brewing on the medium cup size setting creates the best taste.  Just add minature marshmellows and it is a great treat.  However, this is not hot chocolate, which may be a turn off for some tasters."
I really like Pamela's brand mixes.  It's nice to have gluten free mixes that DO taste good. :) The recipes on the bags are awesome plus you can go to Pamela's website for addition recipes.  If you haven't tried this brand yet don't put it off it's wonderful.
"This is delicious.  It makes a gourmet cook out of a novice.  Put it on chicken, pork, steak...it is ca c'est bon.  I wish I could say it in Chinese.  We love it. We purchase it on Amazon Prime.  Saves a trip to the market. Makes a wonderful hostess gift."
"I have a German Breed, G.Sheph. & he is VERY, VERY, PICKY! He loved them. He is such a happy camper. He wakes up in the morning & ready to go for his walks & comes home straight to his treat cabinet, he wants his chicken stix....thank you, finally something that my boy loves...."
"I did order two of these items, but they only shipped one...bad business, why must fight for something that I did paid for in good faith"
"This product is very good. I have really been pleased. As usual of Amazon,it arrived in good timely fashion. Thank you."
"The bottles were both leaking badly; about half the product had leaked through the bottom of the box.  Unfortunately they cannot be returned, so I just wasted money ordering this."
"I prefer my coffee black.  Usually, I turn to my Keurig for a great cup of rich black coffee.  However, the Dolce Gusto does a nice cup of unadorned coffee, as well.  The Caffee Lungo is, indeed, a very nice, naked coffee.  For my taste, though, it is a bit to strongly  flavored.  The frothiness is not altogether to my liking.  However, with a bit of milk and sugar the Lungo is very tasty, indeed.<br /><br />There are two ways to brew it.  The smaller cup is the ""Americano"" while the larger is the Caffee Lungo.  A frothy ""Americano"" seems a bit odd but it is tasty, if a bit to strong.<br /><br />Remember, the strength of the flavor is largely a result of a dark roasting.  A rule of thumb is the darker the roast the less caffeine in the  coffee.<br /><br />Anyway, the Dolce Gusto continues to impress me."
"I agree with Paul.  I had a sick cat and was looking for a deal online.  The Solid Gold tuna looks like 6 oz in the ad but was really 3 oz.  I looked everywhere for a weight, also.  I ended up paying more for this online than if I would have purchased it at Petco."
I returned this item because it contains palm oil.  Bad for the body and VERY bad for our planet.
"The Teriyaki gives these healthy crackers a great flavor.  Baked not fried, low-cal.  They are so good it's really hard to eat just a few."
"Positively delicious!  I love the combination of nuts and raisins in this bar.  It's not too sweet, but sweet enough.  It reminds me of an adult candy bar but without the chocolate and the added benefit of actually being good for you."
"I was SO excited to have found tea that tastes like aveda tea without the price. Based on the high reviews, I figured I would give this tea a try... I just received this tea and it tastes NOTHING like Aveda tea. It does not that that great licorice after-taste that makes you want to have another sip like Aveda tea. This tea also has cinnamon which is not in the Aveda tea at all. Overall, I would NOT recommend this tea to anyone who is looking for Aveda tea. It is very minty and has cinnamon in it."
I had no idea there was a gluten free Bisquick mix..I made pancakes and they were great and the tea cakes also...
"I'm new to food allergies.  My 6mo son was diagnosed with some severe FA and since he's still breastfed, I had to drastically alter my diet.<br /><br />Before learning about this brand, I was stuck eating chicken breasts with potatoes for every meal.  So when I stumbled upon this at my local Whole Foods, I was very excited to try it.<br /><br />Overall, I really like them.  It's got pretty good texture, taste and heft.  It's not so dense that you want to gag after two bites but also not so light that you can eat the whole box (which really isn't that big).<br /><br />I know alot of people complain about the size/packaging and I agree somewhat.  But each bar is an ounce and 120 calories... on par with many other breakfast bars.  I like the Berry flavor the best, it's the closest to real, non FA specialty flavor. Overally, I'm grateful for these bars because now I can tote several in my diaper bag and car and know that when I really need a quick snack, I won't be left stranded."
My wife rates this  5  Stars. SHe is the chocoholic in the family and if you please HER...you please everybody .
"I have a history of mild/moderate acid reflux, so I take it easy with coffee. I was delighted to discover Puroast, which is a reduced acid coffee that is reasonably priced. The French Roast flavor is utterly delicious. It tastes like I went to a coffee house for fancy coffee, but it's just brewed in my drip coffee pot in my kitchen. (Even more convenient if my husband does it for me!) Try it - you won't be disappointed. The cinnamon flavor is also very, very good."
I really enjoyed the Spelt Pretzels.  They were less chalky/dry than other pretzels and had a nice mildly nutty/buttery flavor.  The four (4) grams of fiber per serving were also an added plus.  I purchased these from a local grocery story for $3.79 for one (1) bag.
"This was a fine food until some time in early August, 2008. I bought two bags, this formula for my old, 140 lb dog, and lamb meal and rice for my 1 year old. They had loose stools the entire time. My older dog finished his bag, and I switched him to Innova, the diarrhea cleared up immediately, so the argument that Canidae makes on the web site about needing to make a slow transition is at best specious. I will have to throw out the remaining food for my young dog, to get him back to normal. Investigate the very large number of complaints on the web about the new formula before exposing your pet to it."
"The plastic jug portion of this shattered. After the fact, I learned that the same thing happened to several friends. Great idea, but not well built."
This is a great cup of hazelnut coffee; smooth and balanced with no chemical aftertaste.  My husband and I like it so much that we've ordered it twice directly from the Keurig manufacturer.  SO GLAD that it's now available on Amazon through subscribe and save!
Probably because it doesn't taste like coffee.  It is flavorless.  I saw the good reviews and thought I'd get a couple boxes and now I'm stuck with a bunch of k cups that I don't want to drink because I'd rather literally drink any other k cup I've ever tried.  As you can see I'm not a fan of these k cups.  These are the worst ever.
"Flavor was perfect but absolutely horrible texture!<br /><br />Mushy to the point that they would fall apart when taking them out if you weren't exceptionally careful.<br /><br />Just about to finish our first tin, and if the second is the same I won't be ordering again.<br /><br />If by some chance, the second tin is different I'll update.<br /><br />Otherwise, no news is bad news."
My Dobes would barely let me put the box on the kitchen to open it!  Terrific product at a great price and superior customer service.
"I read a lot of the [mixed] reviews here, and I ordered the product.  I actually tried a small bag at the local Co-op.  I absolutely love them.  They are very tasty and have a not-too sweet nutty flavor.  Yes, there are some color variations in the bag, but it doesn't change the texture or flavor.  I eat them in salads, smoothies, with oatmeal, made chocolate candy with them, and eat them straight out of the bag!  I have not found a negative thing about them.  You should try them, you might like them as much as I do!  And, they are organic which is important to me."
"Carbquik is an amazing product. I use it for all kinds of bread like things on my low carb diet. breadsticks are delicious, the pizza crust is awesome.<br /><br />my only gripe with this is that its TWICE the price on Amazon. Netrition.com offers it for nearly half the price."
being an old chemist with a spectrophotometer I am pleased when the chemical is what they say it is this is what they advertized
"I'm not a coffee drinker, but when I need a pick-me-up this stuff just can't be beat.  It leaves a little silty material at the bottom, but let's face it- if that bothers you, why are you drinking tea?  I mix it with mostly water and a little milk, and this is the closest to authentic Indian chai I've found in the states.  It's simply delicious!  My husband and I were ordering this stuff from the local coffee shop almost daily until they made the mistake of letting us see the box...oops!"
"Got these Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar (15 5oz bags) and was not impressed. Tasted kind of flat. I was eating some out of the bag, when I looked down into the bag and noticed a hole in the bag about the size of a sesame seed. Then I started looking at all the unopened bags and MANY of them had this type same hole. Some bags had multiple holes. One bag had a hole the size of a dime at the bottom of the bag like a rodent had got to it. The box they shipped in had NO holes so they we're packed this way. So much for quality control and who ever let these ship should be fired. Needless to say I'll never be eating anymore Kettle products and expect a full refund from Kettle or Amazon.<br />M. Martin"
"pack of 6. this is delicious when put on top of chocolate cake. but i wish they had the tall tubs instead. either way though, i end up using 2 tubs, but im also making 2 cake mixes at a time so it makes sense. good flavor and creamy texture. fresh taste as well. i will buy some more because i ran out."
I purchased this on the advice from a pet store employee since my 14 yr old cat was throwing up.  The cat won't eat anything other than Friskies wet food and I am pleased that this food stays down much better than regular Friskies.
"these chips were way overpriced for what you get.  i bought them for a special recipe, but in retrospect could have used andes candies and saved a bundle."
"I heated these up in the microwave, and they do not microwave evenly. some will be burnt and hard as a rock when others will be just right. since you dont get very many in one bag, and since about 1/3 dont cook right, you barely get any pork rinds and throw the rest away. Maybe I am not cooking them right, but i followed the directions..."
"Excellent BOLD coffee ... if you're a weak coffee drinker, then this coffee isn't for you ... if you love tasting coffee ... you'll love this blend ..."
"We don't have a dog, but we pet-sit for the neighbors and were hoping these treats would be welcome.  Sadly, the hound just pushed one around the floor and then abandoned it under the table.  Is it because they're so terribly hard ?  Is it some flavor (or lack of flavor) that only dogs can sense ?  Too bad the hound can't read and can't tell why these treats should be such a good healthy treat for him."
"I've always, ALWAYS loved Skittles! They are sweet and chewy, and they will give you plenty of cavities if you're not careful! ^_^<br /><br />Enjoy them, and buy this 3.5 lb bag today!<br /><br />4.5 stars."
"all of the veterinary products made in China are potentially dangerous to your pet.  Do not buy pet products made in China.  Along with the melamine issues of a few years ago, there have been reports of Salmonella on these so called ""treats"".<br /><br />Additionally, there are no good studies showing any efficacy of glucosamine for the treatment of arthritis.<br /><br />And Amazon should make it easier to find the country of origin of all of their products."
I ordered this plant as a gift for a friend and was not told until recently that the plant had died shortly after she received it.  She said she followed care instruction but the leaves started to fall off and it wilted and died.  I wish I had known sooner but she just told me last week.
"I love the cereal, but my local Safeway (San Jose California) has priced this product at $4.79 each, one sale today at 4.49. Some on-line sellers are even higher than Amazon! I'm underwhelmed by the lack of inexpensive product online."
"After dissolving one tab on my tongue, I ate 1/4 of a large lime, and it tasted mostly sweet with just a hint of tartness!  I would have eaten the whole lime but was worried all that acid might upset my stomach.  I didn't notice any difference when I ate parsley, though--the parsley still tasted somewhat bitter to me.  Miracle Berry worked extremely well for me with sour stuff, but not at all as far as I could tell with bitter stuff.<br /><br />Still, well worth the price to experience this amazing transformation in taste.<br /><br />Edit:  I had a craving for blackberries and bought a large container of them from a warehouse-type store.  I planned on eating them all at one sitting, but after one or two I couldn't eat them--they were mostly sour and hardly any sweet.  I remembered that I had some of these tablets left, so I rolled one around on my tongue until it dissolved, and thereafter the blackberries tasted pleasantly sweet, so I was able to finish them all."
"My puppy, Megabyte, is a very picky puppy.  After spending hundreds of dollars on finding treats that she will eat.  These are one of only two."
"I purchased this coffee to make iced coffee drinks.  It has very little 'coffee' taste, and the dark chocolate taste is more chemical than chocolate.  Similar to the taste of flavoring used in baking.<br /><br />I will not be purchasing this coffee again.  My suggestion to those considering a purchase . . . buy something else."
"Excellent starter! Even better than regular Yogourmet starter. Simply delicious! We wouldn't be without it! Good for you, too... We've used this CBA starter for years! Not so ""tart"", creamier and thicker than the regular version."
"I am very disappointed that this Happy Hips product is made in China now. If it wasn't for me going into a pet food store that doesn't carry products not made in the USA I would be still feeding this product to my dog. I am really concerned on finding a new product due to my Bichon's allergies, she can only have Lamb. She now sits at the cabinet and cries for her treat. I think I may need to make my own lamb jerkey in my dehydrator. More work but worth it. With no regulations in China who knows what is swept from the floors and put in the product. As we know the packaging is misleading what is misleading in the ingredents. I have been to China it is scary. We take so much for granted in the USA.<br /><br />dp"
Luv these.  Super tastes and smells when I brew a cup.  Have ordered before and will order again.  My favorite of all the coffees I have tried!!!!!
"I don't know if it was the case of chips we received or what, but everyone we allowed to sample the chips (in a buffet style setting) agreed that these were slightly on the salty side.<br />One person jokingly stated that these would be terrific for melting ice and snow, due to the amount of salt in these.<br /><br />We had ordered these with the expectations that these would be similar to the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips, but these Kettle brands outback bbq chips are the exact opposite.<br /><br />Sorry folks, we just had better expectations from these chips but they a little on the on the salty side.<br /><br />We are still looking forward to Amazon finally getting the Lay's Kettle Mesquite Potato Chips in stock.<br />These got a 2 star, because the bbq powder they had used on these were flavorful enough to be unique."
Love this tea and drink it daily. It is a great tea with a great taste. It sooths the stomach and aids digestion.
"Product is ok, but I consider it very expensive for a small plastic item!  If I had seen the product in person, I never would have paid that much for it."
"When my son and I were diagnosed with Celiac's Disease, I was on the hunt for a bread mix that would make good bagels. I finally found it with Pamela's baking mix. Always enjoying the texture and taste up until January 2011. When I baked up some bagels with the new batch something changed in their mix...and I just couldn't quite figure it out. The color was lighter and the bagels would no longer rise as they used to. The smell was nauseating while it baked and left me with a bad aftertaste and sour stomach. The texture was not chewy and the bagels did not have that beautiful golden brown color to them anymore. I was so disappointed and upset that they changed their mix which was Amazing just the way it was!  The company may receive their flour from another manufacture or they may have changed flour ratio. Whatever they have done, PLEASE change the flour back to the way it used to be! You have lost a dedicated customer! Such a Shame! =("
Popcorn PERFECTION! When they say it's premium popcorn they aren't kidding! High quality popcorn with outstanding flavor. The cheese pack is GREAT! Outstanding real cheese flavor without that cheap acidic taste. Also the popcorn isn't overly greasy. You won't have grease all over your fingers. It's priced a lot higher than the competitors but it's worth it. It doesn't get any better than this!
"Wow, very weird taste.  I typically like all the ingredients, but this mix just tastes wrong.  It's somewhat similar to sarsaparilla tea, but with a licorice aftertaste.  It isn't so bad that I couldn't finish the first cup, but not my cup of tea."
"The product was expired for a year before I received it. It was unusable, and I had to throw it away."
"These figs are firm on the outside and somewhat soft on the inside. I can just feel the health radiating through my body *wink* when I eat them. I dipped them in extra dark heart-healthy chocolate, put each one in a mini-heart muffin paper, and gave as valentine gifts instead of the usual boring, bad-for-you chocolates."
I am a long time customer of Amazon.com and everytime I try to order this bread mix it comes up they will not ship to Canada. Amazon in Canada does not carry food items.<br />Please allow us to order too<br />Mrs Huyben/ Ontario Canada
"I can't really speak to the Detox effectiveness but this is the first herbal tea I've ever really liked the taste of.  I make one cup of tea, add a little packet of stevia then put it in a 32 oz jug of water and chill.  Even diluted that much it still has a nice flavor to me.  I love my Starbucks Iced Venti Soy Chai Tea but my waistline doesn't.  So between this and General Foods International Chai Latte (Sugar-Free) I'm staying clear of Starbucks."
"Creme Caramel is by far my newest favorite!  Great coffee flavor, not too weak, with a wonderful caramel aroma!"
"I normally love Earth's Best products (as does my son). However, tonight after I'd given him half the jar I thought I would try some since it was a new flavor and I realized that there were little pieces or soft shredded plastic in it. I was appalled!  As this is my first child and I don't have any experience with this kind of thing, I called poison control. They said he would be ok and once I knew he was fine, I got really angry. I looked it up online and found that Earth's Best has actually known about the plastic for some time but are still selling it. Don't buy Earth's Best! Really disappointing."
Great for when you're pregnant or nursing...no artificial anything....INCLUDING NO Aspartame.  Yay!  The Bubble gum is the best gum in the whole world.  LOVE this gum.
"I received this item as a gift. As shown in the product images,this box contains a very small amount of candy for the price you pay. The candy is good, but paying almost $20 for $2-3 worth of candy is ridiculous!"
"Very expensive and not worth the price. Try PurityFarm Organic Ghee, it's much cheaper and taste much better than this Ghee. Don't waste your money."
"Being something of an energy drink junkie, I was eager to try this out and see what it tasted like.  ""Green Thunder""? What exactly does that mean..?  My first impression was somewhere between Monster or Mountain Dew, with the sweet tart-ish flavor of Red Bull (even if the radioactive green color is a little unsettling).  Pretty good overall!!  Hard to believe it's zero calorie... I think it tastes great and usually end up putting in more than the two squirts that are recommended. I'm hoping I can use this to wean myself off of Red Bull, seeing as it's much cheaper and waaay lower in calories. In my opinion, Mio has done it again. $4/bottle isn't too bad a price; it's approximately what I can find in grocery stores."
"As I'm not much of a tea drinker, so I gave this to my wife (who is from Japan) to try out before I tried it myself.<br /><br />In Japan, tea is a big deal.  The tea (the leaves as well as the tea itself) has to look good, smell good, and overall present itself as something of great refinement.  No Japanese would offer another person tea that was less than wonderful, except maybe at the office.<br /><br />If the eyes are the window to the soul for Americans, the tea a person serves is the window to the soul of Japanese people.<br /><br />So my real expectation was that my wife would open up the canister, maybe try some herself once, and it just wouldn't pass enough to serve to anyone else.  Wow, was I wrong.<br /><br />She opened it up with her friend, who is also from Japan, with the disclaimer that I got it from Amazon.  Clever Japanese strategy.  If it was coffee, I'd be offended as coffee is my thing, but tea is alright.<br /><br />They loved it right away.  They said, ""Come here.  Smell this.  It's a wonderful aroma.""  They added a few obligatory potential criticisms like, ""This isn't from Japan I suppose.""  And then they drank it.<br /><br />You have to understand, these two ladies drink nothing but the best.  It has to be great or they wont serve it.<br /><br />My wife has served me this tea every day since.  It's that good."
This gum is crumbly and the lackluster flavor fades faster than any gum I've ever chewed. It's gone in around 10 seconds.
"I wish there was a zero star rate for this product. All the chocolate were completely melt , very disgusting. But you cant tell from outside, they just looks very normal. I don't have time to return this product, but I will never shop at  amazon for chocolate"
"I'm trying to cut sugar out of my diet and more importantly, I'm getting rid of Aspartame.  That stuff is a neurotoxin and I'm suffering from some of the long-term health effects of that poison.  I had high hopes for beverages using the new Stevia extract and tried the Other brand with the Stevia ingredient.  The other brand is a little pricey, so I thought I would try this one too. The other brand, outside of the price was a very pleasant experience.  Keeping in mind that this is the only flavor I tried of this brand,  I can't comment on the Blue Sky brand as a whole, but in this one instance, I have to say it sucks.  The initial taste in unpalatable and the after-taste is even worse.  I tried six cans over the course of a week (hoping my taste would acclimate)  and ended up pouring the rest down the drain.  It doesn't taste like a beverage.  I'm not sure what the taste reminds me of, but I definitely cant drink it.  Sorry for the harsh review, but this stuff is awful."
"To those who believe these Onion Rings doesn't have enough 'FLAVOR'; that flavor is what we call sodium.<br />Want to eat 20 bag of high sodium funyuns? Be my guest. In my opinion, these bring the subtle balance between<br />highly saturated flavor with 150% dosage of sodium in one bag vs more decent amount of sodium with just enough flavor<br />to taste it. Yes, bringing the health factor in the chips section is hypocritical but in the end everything counts right?<br /><br />Bottom line is, you will like these alot! Give it a try and you will more or less love them!"
This is the worst energy drink I ever tasted. It has a really big spicy flavor to the drink. The spicy to the drink over powers it and its impossible to even finish one out six. I even tried giving the other five away for free and people would do the same thing I did throw it away. So I really spent about $19.00 down the drain.
"I was looking forward to this flavor. I don't tend to like a very strong brew, but a nice light coffee flavor with a touch a vanilla is something I enjoy. This coffee was awful. The coffee reminded me of cheap Folgers with some international delights creamer thrown in. Typically that grosses me out, it's so artificial tasting and that is what I got with this. Glad it was just one in a variety pack and I didn't have money wasted. I think I'll stick to a good regular brew and add my own vanilla."
"Beer nuts are an incredible and healthful snack as long as you don't overeat them. Each 1.25 oz. package is just the right amount for a delicious ""break"" between meals. I don't know why stores do not have this item. The package is also convenient to put in a brief case or any other carry item."
Ordered two for my partner who is on a navy cruise and he said that none of them broke and wanted more already lol (i guess they took to long to get there...so here's to purchasing more)
"I tried these in Colorado and came home to find out they only sell them on the west coast. Amazon didn't sell the ones I wanted. I put it on a wish list as a gift for a loved one. Within a week of their birthday, Amazon e-mailed me that it was available. Great chips but, took longer to ship then expected. Just in the nick of time for the birthday. When you want something real bad, Amazon usually comes through."
"This tea was a major disappointment. I had been used to drinking the Assam from Teaism in DC and was looking forward to buying this variety of Assam in bulk to save money but it ended up being a waste of money. There is no flavor no matter how long you steep it or how much you use. It gets two stars because it does not taste bad, there just is no taste."
"Good stuff, take it easy if your not used to it. it improves taste of food, better breathing, better circulation, helps with arthritis a bit"
"Although this bread tasted decent. My husband had a severe allergic reaction. When he contacted Pamela's Products they told him many has had an allergic reaction to this mix. He advised them that they should post this information. Whether they will or not is up to them. This reaction caused his stomach to close and he had to go in and have it ballooned back open. If they would have posted ""many people"" having allergic reactions, we may have thought twice about trying this product and could have saved him a lot of severe pain plus the approx. $4000.00 for the procedure he had to have done. He has had no reaction to the Pamela's Baking and Pancake mix and the pancakes are really good. Good luck to those trying this product."
"This coffee is extremely weak. It lacks flavor, like drinking a cup of hot water, yuck! Not what I expected from Green Mountain and the name ""Nantucket Blend""."
"I have recently stopped eating a number of allergens (dairy, soy, nuts) and these were one of the few snacks which fit into my dietary restrictions.  Unfortunately, these were pretty gross - miserable texture and more cardboard flavored than berry.  I threw them away.  I would recommend the cocoa ones as they are much tastier and also allergen free."
"I was sadly disappointed in this brand of Assam tea. Once properly brewed, the tea was weak. When I brewed another pot, I added more tea, in the hopes of making it drinkable.  The second pot was weak, and bitter."
"Love these popchips.  They are all great.  Do not care for the salt & pepper flavors.  I wish manufacturer would come up with a variety pack that didn't include that flavor as that flavor is just wasted with each purchase I make (and I've made alot!).  The BBQ, Original, Salt & Vinegar and Sour cream & onion chips are superb!"
"I bought a package of these at Starbucks, and thought good crispy, hmmmm so I bought a case of a mix cinnamon, sugar, chocolate chip and oatmeal.  First they all tasted the same.  They are probably suppose to be crispy but they taste stale, and then they leave an awful aftertaste.  They also taste way to buttery and a portion side is two cookies and the rest are all cracked in the package.<br /><br />There is nothing special about these and are not worth the price, although I love the packaging.<br /><br />Sorry Lucy I've tasted way better GF cookies."
"I purchased this item and then saw it for $20 less in a big retail store.  When I contacted Amazon I was told that they couldn't do anything for me and the price I paid was firm.  I wrote them and told them I was going to return the item and buy it where I had seen it for much cheaper and they just didn't care.  When I asked how much my refund was going to be they told me approximately $3.00 more than what they had credited me for.  I don't like to be deceived and I thought you get the best prices with Amazon, but that is not true at all.  Keep checking other places before you purchase from Amazon and there Customer Service stinks in my opinion.  Furthermore, I received my item from the other place and I love it!"
"Popchips are so much better than, say, potato chips with about 1/10th the calories and fat.  I have tried the variety case and absolutely love all the flavors.  Instead of chips and dip, I now have popchips plain or with fat-free dip or salsa and still loose weight eating something that I truly enjoy!!!  Popchips are the best tasting 120 calorie snack on the market.  It truly does replace your craving for salty, high fat potato chips, doritos, fritos, etc.  You may be amazed when you try these popchips!!"
"This is a great coffee. I have tried many, many kinds for my Kerug... this one is a nice balance of rich flavor. It's a great coffee for everyday... if you are looking for something that is good and not too expensive this is it."
"these are not DOP they're just ""certified"" which means nothing significant. they should go a step further with a little more nonsense and write ""department certified"". real dop tomatoes are much better."
I have this coffee in the past and really enjoyed it. However this one I received was so weak that neither my sister-in-law or I could drink it. It was left for my mother who likes weak coffee. It feels like it's only half full so it may have been a bad box. Like I said I've really enjoyed it the past when I've purchased it at the grocery store.
"Convenient, cost effective and delicious.  I went to the local grocery store and for the same amount of money, the ingredients weighed about half the weight of Great Northern.  Worth the buy and I recommend it.<br /><br />I just don't recommend following the included instructions.  Before you turn it on, add the oil, then turn it on and add the rest of the ingredients ... you won't accidentally melt the plastic package. IMHO"
I was very unhappy when this package arrived at my workplace. The bags were not wrapped for shiping and was damage in route.  When I opened the box the baking soda was spiling all over the place.  I could not identify where the many holes were and did not have acess to a container to put them in so I threw it away.  I made a mess all over the place  What a waste.  I will not be ordering from this company again.
"Just wanted to warn any potential buyers that I received an open package buying from Amazon LLC.  I think that's pretty disgusting since this is a product that's intended for consumption by your pet.  Also, there were portions of the red ""meat"" that looked like it had been chewed on and the white bone portion was stained red all over.  Basically it looked as if a dog had chewed on it for a little and then repackaged up and sold on Amazon.  Buyer beware."
"My 3.5 yr old daughter with Autism loves these! She is on a special gluten-free, casein-free and soy-free diet and these are a wonderful snack for her."
This food is great. My 11 year old beagle loves it and she is much more active since I changed her food. I highly recommend this dog food.
"We have purchased Newman O's Original for several years now.  They are way better than Oreos.  Crunchier, very tasty, and no trans fat, so they are much healthier for children!  Highly recommended -- will not buy Oreos anymore."
If you are an almond fan like me and like sweets as well this is a great treat.  And healthy as well.
For anyone who likes pork rinds and a decent spicy flavor these are the way to go!<br />Super easy to cook in the microwave and less cost than buying regular ones.<br />Great taste! Easy and not bad on carbs and fat as well!
"The hubby & and I have sworn off microwave popcorn for some time as, regardless of brand, it tends to leave an oily residue in the mouth and hulls stuck between the teeth, all followed by a night of indigestion depending on how much ""stuff"" that particular manufacturer adds to differentiate their brand.<br /><br />However, given the rave reviews we decided to try Black Jewell. It absolutely lives up to its reputation. It is flavorful, light and crunchy, with just the right amount of salt. - The hubby & I disagree on this point. He likes to add more salt.<br /><br />While there has been some variation, of the many bags we have popped, there truly have been few ""old maids"" as we used to call kernels that didn't pop, fewer hulls lodged in the dental work, and no cloying aftertaste.<br /><br />We're having a hard time keeping it on hand as we keep giving boxes away for others to try! :)"
"We've given our dog Zuke's Hip Action for about two years. She had been taking Rimadyl for back problems, but due to some other health problems could no longer take that long term. The Hip Action product is working for her to keep her free from pain and very mobile. It has made a great difference in her quality of life - plus she loves getting her 'treat' every day!"
I drink about 4 to 6 cups of coffee every morning - I'm always looking for a new flavor - so I gave it a try - I drank it but I would not order again. steve
"My dog has many food allergies, but these made-in-the-USA treats are free of wheat, corn, egg, and dairy.  My dog can't get enough of them."
"I have 2 large dogs, one of which is rather picky with treats.  They eat these up.  I like the fact they are organic and healthier than rangular dog treats you get at the grocery store, which you have no idea what some of the ingredients are in a lot of those.  These treats aren't very good smelling or nice to look at, dry brown squares, but I'm not the one eating them. I would definitely choose these over other crap that is on the shelves."
my yorkies love these things. I have a 3 pounder and an 11 pounder and they think getting these are the bees knees! i tried the other sizes but i think since these just fit right in their mouth they love it. The product has a really over bearing smell but once you get over that (it is a dog treat) its amazing
"We have tried several whole bean hazelnut coffees, including ""gourmet"" ones, and like this one best...and Amazon had the best price."
"I ordered on a Wednesday and USPS tried to deliver on Saturday but I wasn't home.  Picked them up on Monday morning from the post office, and except for one of the pitchers being slightly crumpled, everything is still alive and looks exactly like the picture! I got 4 chutes with a 5th growing in.  Overall a good purchase."
"This is a wonderful powdered chai mix.  It is mixed with hot water, can be iced, can have milk added.  A local shop here served it and sold it for home use.  I really like it.<br /><br />That said, I subtracted a star because of the ""99% caffeine free"" statement in the product listing.  While it may be technically correct (I'm not sure how I'd calculate whether the can contains only 1% caffeine, and whether by weight or volume), I think it is misleading.  I use caffeinated products, but seek decaf for my son.  I do not feel that 65mg of caffeine per serving counts as ""caffeine free,"" and would suggest that this part of the product description should be amended or removed.<br /><br />Meanwhile, I see that at least one other reviewer has noted the caffeine issue, and I will call attention to it, as well.  Still great tasting chai mix, would just like to see an improved product description rather than a misleading statement and a legal disclaimer."
"I'm one of those fussy dog owners that read labels and annoy others and so I really like the ingredients in this and think this would be a 5 star product for a lot of owners. My dogs certainly liked the flavor, but they aren't a fussy crew -- still, I feel good about this biscuits. The reason I'm holding back a star is because two out of three of my dogs -- my greyhound and my sheltie -- are seniors and this is a harder treat than is really comfortable for them and the treats are hard to break into pieces. (Soaking in water for a couple minutes seems to help.) Some dogs genetically have really made tartar prone teeth and that's these two and there have been extractions over the years. My dachshund also has to work to crunch through it due to the size -- remember, couldn't break it -- and the hardness, but she managed.<br /><br />If you have a medium and up dog with good teeth, them this is quite highly recommended. If you're constantly looking for a softer treat, they're less ideal and might at least need a little soak."
"i don't care for the unpleasant aftertaste this leaves.  I loved that it was organic, and wanted to try a new sweetener.  It dissolves easily in my hot tea, but it gives that coconut flavor and tastes slightly metalic."
"I purchased this coffee to replace my Lavazza because Lavazza quality has been inconsistent.  Upon opening, I noticed no date on the package... concerning.  I tuned my Vario grinder to ensure the correct grind for this new bean.  I pulled a shot of espresso (I have an Andreja Premium from QuickMill)... Horrible.  I adjusted the grind three more times with as many shots.  The shots were consistently watery, bitter, and, quite frankly, embarrassing.  DO NOT purchase this product.  I will use these beans to pull throw-away shots after cleaning my grinder and espresso machine... that's all they are good for."
I'm giving this treat to my dogs for 3 years and they love it!  Very healthy and made in USA!<br />Very fast shipping too!
"I bought this for my 8-mo-old blue heeler/husky puppy, and she managed to pull the rope enough to break it within 2 days. She's a rough-and-tumbler to be sure, but they claimed it was indestructible. Hardly.<br /><br />Pity too, she'd almost learned how to use it."
"Grove Square Hot Chocolate is the best K-cup hot chocolate. I read many reviews before making this purchase, and now I agree, and will continue to buy this brand."
"These chips arrived in terrible condition. The box they were sent in was a display box with all the usual perforations on the box for display. Why someone would send a box like that in the mail and not have put it in another real box is beyond me. The box we received was heavily taped to keep it together since the box came open on the display perforations and looked like someone had driven over the box as well, which gives you an idea of the shape of the box. The chip bags inside were pretty flat, there were no chips, but plenty of crumbs for any use you would need crumbs for. This is how many of the packages looked, flat. There were a few with edible chips, but not many. Not sure what to think of shipping chips in this type of a box, common sense should have been used??"
These are our favorite indulgence at 100 calories for a sweet fix and energy- they are the best!  Sad to see on Amazon they are no longer available ;-(<br />Quick shipping and they arrived safely!
"I understand that the smell of cooked broccoli isn't the greatest, but we gradually introduced this to my son who absolutely loves it.  It's also a great way to get some vegetables in him too.<br /><br />To each their own I suppose..."
"I was first reading reviews @ the Starbucks website for this coffee, and it had great reviews, so I though I might give it a try. I went to downtown and bought a bag of whole bean Caffe Verona and boy I am glad I made that decision.<br /><br />Out of the bag, the rich dark brown colors and the aroma punished me of the years I lived without this. A blend of 80% Yukon Blend, an array of Latin American and Indonesian coffees; and, 20% Italian Roast - a blend of Latin American coffees.<br /><br />In the cup the flavor was weak, bold as it smelled it did not seem to have the same score in taste. Light bodyweight with a woody feel to it. The light acidity is topped off with a fruity overtone and bittersweetness.<br /><br />Let me be as bold as to recommend Peet's Arabian Mocha-Java. If you are looking for a Multiblend similar to this, Peet's fixes whatever lacked in Starbuck's Verona. This Mocha-Java is balanced, nutty and smooth. It has excellent acidity, with a slight bite.<br /><br />If you want a closer mix to this than I would mix the Arabian Mocha-Java with Sumatra and you will be very satisfied with its resemblance.<br /><br />There are many coffee drinkers who hate Starbucks because of their corporate culture and popularity. I just like to try anything which looks interesting to me and this caffe Verona is one of the better speciality blends Starbucks has offered.<br /><br />I almost forgot to mention, whole beans always rule . Even if you ground your beans at your nearest cafe or supermarket, the moment the ground coffee comes in contact with the air, the aroma starts to leak. Grind your beans moments before you put it to use, you will see notice the change in taste and aroma when you are drinking it."
This is a healthy and good snack for my dog.  It is a great training produst too.  When you take into account that a couple are all she needs it is a good value.
It seemed like it worked at first but after a week the ants were back with more growing.  Very frustrating.  Combat gel worked last year but could not find it this year.
"I will start off by saying I have yet to purchase this on amazon but I have purchased this at health food stores. So I can not say how it will arrive to you but i cant tell you about the taste.<br />  Amy's organic has consistently done a great job of creating delicious vegan/vegetarian organic food. This soup has a very similar taste to certain canned pasta product. It totally brought me back to my childhood. It is extremely delicious, low in fat and calories. It is a quick and healthy alternative to the old stand-bys we are used to. Whether to give your child a better lunch or a trip down memory lane for yourself please give this soup a chance."
I had so hoped they would be close or better than Cheetos Flamin' Hot but they aren't. They were NOT past the expiration by  3 months but they did taste stale and almost flavorless even though you get a tiny after burn. I gave the rest of the case to the food shelter.
"I have Celiac disease, and been on a GF diet for over a year.  I have not had problems with any GF foods, but each time I eat a slice of this bread, I get stomach upset.  I am not allergic to dairy or eggs.  Celiacs beware- there is something tainted in this mix."
"I've purchased this item twice.  The first delivery was excellent in all respects.  The sun-dried tomatoes looked and smelled great, and they tasted even better - I ate many of them straight from the bag.  Unfortunately I re-ordered and the second shipment was awful.  The tomatoes were over-dried, dark brown in color, and smelled burned.  Worst of all they tasted horrible in everything I've tried to use them in so far.  Honestly I think I'll probably throw away the rest before I have to throw away any more dinners prepared with these.  A huge disappointment after my initial impression, and due to the cost of a 5 lb. bag."
I purchased this 12 pack of pumpkin and was delighted.  All cans were perfect...no dents at all.  The pumpkin was flavorful and great to work with.  I would recommend this purchase highly.
"The rope is made of rubber, and after about 30 minutes my little 20 lb. terrier had chewed up the rope, thereby eliminating the ""tug"" part of the toy. I wouldn't be surprised if she ingested some of it. For $10, this toy needs a more durable rope."
"This was a little smaller than I thought, but my fault for not reading the measurements. It seems well made out of a vinyl type material and the color really pops in person. The mom I gave it to really loved it and thought it would fit all her necessities in an easy to organize and carry package, so missing accomplished Hadaki!"
I admit I don't usually drink decaf but this is a favorite in my office and I felt it deserved a good rating.
"My two elderly Lhasa Apso dogs loved these organic and healthy treats.  We compared them to the treats we usually give them, and they made it clear that the Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog treats were every bit as good as their old-time favorites---and I am sure they were much healthier.  The only problem we had was with the size of the treats and the hardness of them for dogs that are as old as our two pets.  We did have to break them up into little pieces but then they quickly devoured them, seemingly having no trouble chewing up the pieces.  We did a test by placing their old brand of treats on a plate along with the Lamb and Barley treats; they finished the latter first and were looking for more so I surmised they felt the extra chewing was worth it.  I would definitely recommend these for younger dogs with better chewing power than our 16 and 17-year-old family pets. Anyway, a ""thank you"" from Mopsy and D. J."
"I bought these chips looking at its sale rank as one of the most sold chips on amazon.com. Unfortunately, I was highly disappointed. Way too much vinegar and they aren't like regular potato chips, some weird ""pops""."
"We love this product!  Our baby is 6 months old and we're introducing new foods to her.  So far she has tried the pumpkin, and she can't get enough!!!  She grabs for the spoon!  We love that this product is organic and that use can use breastmilk to mix so your baby gets added nutrients.  It's portable, compact, and you can take it anywhere.  If at a restaurant or away from home, simply warm up your milk and combine.  It's really fantastic!"
"I had previously purchased the chicken and the duck from this line so I wanted to try the beef liver.<br />Well, my dog likes the flavor but I don't like how dry they are. They have very sharp edges and I had to be creative to soften them a bit so that my dog wouldn't suffer from a rapture in the esophagus while eating them as they are. The other 2 (chicken + duck) are a little chewer than this one. I would not buy this again unless texture improves."
"After reading several glowing reviews about this product, I decided to buy it and see for myself how great it is.<br /><br />After following the instructions, I taste tested a variety of items, that were suggested on the packaging. None of which seemed to have any affect. On lemons, I noticed a slight taste change, however the lemon was no sweeter.<br /><br />Bottom line; the product is over-hyped, and in my opinion, is not worth the buying. I know it's definitely not something I will ever purchase again."
"I have been using this product, as well as the duck breast, for well over a year. There is no comparison to Tail Waggers from [...]. This product is the only one that my 3 dogs will eat without hesitation. They have put their noses up to all other treats, except this brand."
I love this jell-o I don't eat cake or candy or any kinds of sweet so this jello is the sweets for me.
Kind of  a ripoff.  I bought the theater box instead of the 5 piece candy bar version and that turned out to be a big mistake.  Each box has only 8 or 9 pieces and they are randomly filled so you are not guaranteed even 1 piece of each flavor.  One box had 6 green pieces and 3 black.  A better value is 20 pack of the original 5 piece bar.  This theater box is sold by weight (4oz) and not volume.  The box is about 90% empty- Ripoff!
"This is a wonderful warm flavored tea, especially now in colder weather.<br />This tea has a sweet,soothing chamomile fragrance. It is subtle and sweet.It's one of the better chamomile teas.<br />If you find it hard to sleep at times, a cup of this sweet chamomile tea may help.<br />If you really like sweet taste try Bigelow Chamomile Mango Herbal Tea.<br />I highly recommend both."
"I've purchased many different Americolor gel colors and am happy with them when they are fresh. I purchased 7 bottles from this TCP vendor and 5 of them were old, one even had a use by date of one year before my order! Working with TCP to get a refund has not been as pleasant as working directly with Amazon. I finally did get a refund but only for the product, not the shipping charges. The products were old and unusable. I am very disappointed with this vendor and will purchase my colorants from another more reliable source. Americolor is good TCP is not."
"WE LOVE LOVE LOVE these muffins. They are moist and delicious !! We like them best the day you bake them. The 2nd day they do dry out a bit but are wonderful if you pop them in the toaster oven for a few min to warm them up, then they are good as new. Our only complaint is that they are DIFFICULT to find !! BUT DEF Worth every penny !!"
this coffee has a very funny taste to it not good you would think wolfgang it would be good dont buy this coffee this is a review of 6 people there are 6 people in my shop we all hate it not good
"As I have with all other Earth's Best jarred baby food, I won't be purchasing these Dinners for my baby because the jar lids contain BPA.  I contacted Earth's Best's consumer relations dept. personally, and the representative read me a prepared statement saying that the epoxy resin that lines Earth's Best baby food jar lids contains ""trace amounts"" of BPA, but it ""doesn't come into direct contact with the food.""  That kind of lukewarm response wasn't enough to put my concerns about BPA to rest ... after all, packaged food is jostled-around so much during shipping that these jars could spend days upside down, with the food resting directly on the jar lids.  So I guess I'll have to pass on these jarred Dinners for now.  (The Earth's Best rep did say that they were doing ""accelerated testing"" of BPA-free alternatives for lining their baby food jars).<br /><br />This is such a shame, because Earth's Best is the only company that makes organic, pre-packaged Stage 2 complete meals (e.g., with meat/protein, veggies & carbs/starch) in PUREE form.  All the other organic baby food manufacturers, such as Plum, Sprout, Ella's Kitchen, etc., only make Stage 3 meals, in chunky form.  Earth's Best does make some baby food in BPA-free squeeze pouches, but that doesn't include its Dinner line.  I was hoping to be able to expose my little-one to a wider variety of flavors and well-balanced meals while still at the puree stage.  But I guess I'll have to wait until she's old enough for Stage 3 chunky meals, or make her baby food myself.  (Virtually impossible for this super-busy and domestically-challenged mom, LOL!)"
"These were a pleasant surprise...You know when you are looking around for something to munch on and you don't want another Triscuit or a Potato Chip or even something two sweet or two dry?<br />This is it!<br />These are just moist enough, great flavor...right on time...wish I had one now!"
"I really love Kettle brand chips, but these are rather disappointing. There is very little sour cream or onion flavor."
these green mountain k cups are great tasting with my favorite breakfast blend and its very conveninet and the best k cups for me that we like will buy again
"I'm not a gourmet coffee critic, but this stuff is disappointing.  Based upon previous good reviews, I suspect that the coffee in the K-cups I received is not the same -- they may have changed the manufacturing.  The Wolfgang Puck Decaf I received is lifeless, watery, and tasteless.  There's no aroma when it's brewing in the Keurig.  Never again."
"Madhave blonde coconut sugar:  put in my tea and black specks floated to the top. not bugs, just unidentified black specks<br />of something. not very appealing. tried it again in a cup of coffee. got a sliver of something that looked like a hair-thin<br />toothpick. realized it must be one of the stringy hair-like parts of the OUTSIDE of the coconut. then I got another, spit it<br />out and dumped the coffee. I'm back to Xyletol, and I'm throwing out $27 worth of coconut sugar. this was one BAD buy!!!"
Ordered this and most of the boxes were stale and stuck together.<br /><br />Checked the expiration date and it wasn't expired.<br /><br />Starting to think they just changed the expiration date and shipped everything that went bad.
"The carbonation in this drink was way too much. So much in fact, that it over powered the flavor. (Orange-tangerine is usually very good together).  I expect this from a soda, but not a ""healthy"" drink. Lose some of that club soda bite and you have one delicious drink. Until then, I'll pass."
that is so unfair. I was a faithful customer now i have to go buy them somewhere else . Why Amazon!!!
We had these along with Omaha prime rib. Both were great. Two where plenty to fill up. Made them in toaster oven in less then 20 minutes.
"frozen and fresh on arrival awsome tasting highly recomend this co.,the lobster tails were as advertized jumbo and tasty,some of the best ive ever had"
"This is not regular coffee as the description would lead you to believe... it's artificially flavored, and it appears from the other ratings that you either love the flavor or hate it. My household hated it. Of course, that would be my problem if the description was accurate, but it's not. Amazon refunded my money and said someone would check the information on the product page."
"Not sure if this was AUTHENTIC Cosmic Catnip, as it had a lot more larger bits of stems and coarse material. My cats had loved this stuff when I had gotten a small sample from a local pet store. So, I thought it would be a great idea to get this larger size, but the catnip was not the same. My cats barely like this stuff and it even hurts my fingers when I pinch it to release the aroma. Would not recommend this 3 oz size!"
"After doing numerous googles looking for Chipsters, one of my favorite childhood snacks, some reported that this product was very close to them. I disagree. About the closest flavor to the Chipsters so far would be Munchos, but still not the same. If you are conscious of diet, these will probably due."
"I couldn't resist the price... so many beef sticks for so cheap. However, I think I was expecting something different. The jerky has a good taste, and at first it wasn't very oily, but as they got older (and exposed to the air) I did notice some oil spots forming through the casings of the sticks. Overall, if you can consume this, say, within 1 week of opening, they are great! If you need something that will stick around longer (stick, get it?) then maybe this isn't the right product. They also sent me a free sample of some of their other products with my order, and the shipping was quick. I like the company, the beef sticks just weren't what I was looking for, I guess."
"I have been looking for Morinu Soft Tofu, Silken. I was happy when I found that Amazon.com had it. I still don't know if I like it as well as the Firm. I have to try it a little longer."
"Awesome baby food, I bought it online to save a few bucks, but some of the jars were broken when they arrived. 5 stars for the food, 1 star for packing and shipping quality."
"This tea is a must for people who like a flavored tea.  It has enough spice to taste but not overpowering.  It works quickly and easily in my Keurig K-Cup coffee maker.  With a couple of ice cubes it makes a delicious ice tea as well.  I have been buying this brand for several years, and now with the auto ship from Amazon, I have tea whenever I need it."
"DON'T YOU KNOW THAT SUGAR IS THE SAND OF TIME ?  SINCE THE INGREDIENTS OF KAVLI CRISPY THIN WERE LISTED ON AMAZON, AND THE TIME I RECEIVED MY ORDER,  SUGAR  WAS ADDED TO THIS PRODUCT.  YOU ARE GOING TO GET IN TROUBLE, MISTER."
Great tasting cheddar crackers. Too bad the idiot manufacturer has stopped making it. This is your last chance to buy some before the supply runs out.
This is a wonderful product that my dog really loves.  there is only one thing to make this product better - 30 chews in the box so we would have one for every day of the month.
"I had a good experience with other Amazon grocery products and these were a good deal, so I bought a three pack. They weren't horrible but they don't taste the same as the ones you buy in the store. They taste like cheap generic chocolate chip cookies. Which is not necessarily bad, but not what I expected for the price and Chips Ahoy brand.<br /><br />They are cheaper tasting, a little stale and much less chocolate chips. I haven't had store-bought Chips Ahoy for a few months so maybe they changed the formula for all these cookies, but if not, then these seem to be cheap knock-offs made with cheaper ingredients."
I have purchased green coffee beans from several local and internet providers often with poor results.  U-Roast-Em is the exception. I have never had bad service with this company and now purchase all of my coffee from them.  They provide an excellent selection of high quality beans at great prices.  They do a great job with packaging and shipping!  Most of my orders have shipped the same day I ordered.<br /><br />I have tried most of their coffees and have yet to be disappointed.  If you are looking for a good mid priced coffee I would recommend La Minita Tarrazu de Costa Rica.<br /><br />I highly recommend you check out U-Roast-Em for all your coffee needs!
THIS IS THE BEST CHAI TEA I HAVE EVER HAD.  I DO NOT LIKE SPICES IN MY CHAI TEA AND THIS ONE DOES NOT HAVE EXTRA SPICES IN IT.
"Great and simple product. Is replacing my k-cups and goes with me everywhere. Simple, fast, convenient, affordable and so much better than most products out there. You wonder how long before there is some serious competition."
"I got this as a gift for my girlfriend's mother who had mentioned getting heart burn from coffee - even though she loves coffee.  I thought this might make a reasonable fix to the situation.  After trying though she seemed to be a little less worried with the heart burn and little more concerned with the taste.  She didn't have heartburn, but she also didn't drink very much either - due to taste.  She thought it tasted a little stale and bland.  Maybe it was just a bad batch, but seems the process to limit the acid also limits the flavor.  Too bad, I had hoped this was going to be a big winner."
"Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanuts...the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted. Not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as ""Jumbo""."
I was excited to try this sauce after reading the reviews.  I was very disappointed in the flavor of the marinade.  If you like a smokey flavor than this is for you.  I was hoping for a fajita flavor.
"I love Senseo Paris!  It's easy, fast and great-tasting, with never that chemical aftertaste of so many of the French-vanilla coffees.  Amazon is the only place I can find it consistently...so I have it on the subscription plan!  Thanks Amazon and Senseo!"
The tea was very weak and not that good. Now I have six boxes of tea I that no one in my family likes.
"Love the chips, nice 100 +/- calorie snack, reminds me of Munchos, but less greasy, flavors are good (salt & vinegar least favorite). And they've started shipping APO--thank you and my family thanks you (so they don't have to get the package and reship!) Made my day."
My celiac daughter loves the gluten free animal pasta.  It is by far her favorite.  We make macaroni and cheese with it and she asks for it several times a week and takes the leftovers to school for lunch the next day.  She loves that the pasta is animal shapes and different colors and the horse is her favorite.  A must have.
"When I used the k-cup filter that came w/keurig, I didn't like the taste of any coffee I used so I stopped using it altogether.  However, when I saw DisposaKups on Amazon, I had my doubts but took a chance...They worked great.  Plan to keep them in stock."
"My German Shepherd is incredibly picky when it comes to treats... So I was incredibly excited that he was finally happy about a toy I had given him.<br /><br />I, however, was not happy that it only took him 8 minutes to eat the entire thing.<br /><br />I was also not happy when he puked the entire thing up (and his dinner) 12 hours later at 4AM... Customer reviews are pretty consistent that this product is too expensive for what it is, and is making the dogs sick.<br /><br />I would never recommend this product to anyone, and will be informing my fellow dog rescue colleagues never to buy this product."
MADE IN CHINA..<br />Even our dog food has gone the way of the Hershey Kiss. I won't be back to this vendor.<br />Will be looking for made and sold in AMERICA only.....
"Smooth with a hint of flavor.  Medium boldness yet rich in taste.  Not a ""wake me up"" but certainly enjoyable!"
"I was hesitant to buy a larger bottle at first because I had read some reviews regarding a clear bottle and a decrease in quality from OliveNation, so I bought the smallest container to try it out. I encourage you to ignore the previous review about there being alcohol in the extract: all extracts are suspended in alcohol- normally an pure fruit oil and alcohol mixture.<br /><br />Anyways, the extracts were well packaged and shipped quickly. I was pleased to find that the 4 oz container is tinted glass and the aroma is superb. I have used the extract in various baked goods and it provides a lovely hint of lemon.<br /><br />The only con about this item is that it is very subtle. I need to add what seems to me to be a lot of extract to get the dominate lemon flavor in things like lemon poppy seed muffins.<br /><br />I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone who is in short supply of fresh lemon juice. This makes an excellent substitution."
"The cheese pack with the popcorn is mostly salt.  Put it on the popcorn and you have salty popcorn.  It's orange but it doesn't taste anything like cheese.  Without the packet it is very bland, dull and only looks like popcorn.  Best to skip this and look for something better."
My puppy just preferred to eat the toy than the treats. My older dogs were curious but did not do any thing. However the red plastic is pretty stong. My dog has been chewing on it for a few days. So if anything it gives your dog something to chew on other than your shoes.
"This was a Christmas Gift for my wife. This and Green tea are the only ones that she drinks. Good price and shipped fast,(in time for x-mas) Everyone is happy"
"Recently bought this for use in a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001CNG7RY"">DeLonghi EC702 15-Bar-Pump Espresso Maker, Stainless</a> and this bean rocks.<br /><br />I consistently get a very nice crema and the flavor is just mild enough to drink the espresso straight."
"after multiple tries its always the same, the popcorn pops about 50%. it is definitely bad popcorn because i succesfully used the oil pack with my own popcorn and achieved great results. i found it interesting that there is no date code on either the case or the packages. isn't there a law about that or something?"
"I got this product for my husband beause he loves Dr Pepper. It came before the date it was suppose to arrive on. He loves it he wants to drink it but he doesnt, he is keeping it as a collertors item beause they dont make them anymore. The item was packed good and safe and everything was there. NO COMPLAINTS!"
"I used to eat tofu almost every. And i havn't had those for a while.<br />So i was searching and i was actually surprised that amzon has tofu!<br />I was Half-curious and Half-pleased!So i bought it..and i don't regret it.<br />It's Organic, cheap and doesn't need to be refrigerated until opend.<br />I just like to eat these by it self or with udon soup.<br />I am going to buy this again. So good..: )"
"I have a stubborn chihuahua/daschund mix dog.  Kibbles 'n Bits is the only dog food that he will eat with any degree of consistency.  He actually prefers the mini-bits. (I guess size does matter.)  I tried premium foods thinking they would be better for him, and, at most, I've only been able to get him to eat each brand once or twice."
"This very crispy sugar wafer is perfect with ice cream, or with coffee or tea.  It's got a lovely burnt marshmallow flavor.  I really like these- they seem to harmonize with anything.  I'm allergic to GMo cornstarch, so it is hard for me to find cookies I can eat.  This one is lovely, and it's safe for me to eat."
My Dogs love this natural kibble.  It's simple (only rice and protein) yet tasty.  They maintain a healthy weight and have regular and healthy bowl movements.  Wellness is a fantastic product for dogs because they keep in mind the many ingredients that are not natural to a dog's diet and keep it out of their food.
"I can honestly say this is the worst frosting we have ever bought. It's kind of generous to call it frosting, it has more the consistency of rubber cement. And since we were in a time crunch, we didn't have the luxury of going back out to the store for a different frosting, so we forged ahead and decorated a cake with it. Horrible experience, bad enough to put us off cake decorating forever. It spread about as easily as chewing gum, stuck to everything it came in contact with, and got crumbs of the cake mixed up in it. On top of all this, it didn't even taste good. By the time we were done decorating, we knew there was no way we could feed this mess to our family. So we ended up going to the store anyway to buy a pre-made cake. Our cake, which took twice as long to decorate because this stuff is so gooey, was used as a centerpiece. A really ugly centerpiece, that cracked and peeled as the frosting dried."
"I've tried so many K-cups. The greatest problem I have with K-cups is many are too weak for me and I've never liked a ""strong"" cup of coffee. You know the one's that make your grow chest hair. I've tried many flavored K-cups but all are a milder coffee for some reason. However, I'm so glad I found this vanilla k-cup. I can actually taste the vanilla and coffee in my cup of coffee with this k-cup. I enjoyed my sample of this so much that I bought 2 boxes of 48ct in addition to the Hazelnut. I hope the Hazelnut is just as good."
"My dogs loved these treats!!  Recently my 9 yr old hound that has never been to the vet got sick.  Couldn't keep anything down and after 3 days of this we went to pet emergency.  $1200.00 later it was concluded that it was something digested.  Not possible, I spare no expense when it comes to my 3 furry buddy's!  I grabbed the bags of treats and sure enough, MADE IN CHINA.  Went to FDA web site in 2012 and they said chicken from CHINA bad but no recalls yet.  DOGS have been getting sick from chicken products from china, advised not to buy.  Called company and no return call.<br />Trashed them all!!"
"We ordered a pack of these and ate through them very quickly! My husband and I both like taking them to work for lunch. Here's my recipe, so that I get more protein: I slip a fresh unbroken egg into the box before I leave home in the morning, then I add the egg to the water before I cook it at lunchtime."
"This product is wonderful. It becomes real peanut butter by just mixing with a little water, but without all the fat of grocery story peanut butter.<br />when we eat bananas, we often dip the banana into a little dry peanut butter. Delicious. Medical specialists urge people to eat some nuts every day, so this product fits the bill."
"These were kind of expensive for a dog treat and two of my dogs wouldn't even touch them, so I doubt I would buy them again."
"I used this in homemade protein bars and it worked great. Good flavor, longer shelf life, and healthier than regular peanut butter. A nice addition to the cupboard."
"I can finally get rid of the five boxes of K-cups sitting on my counter.  The padded top of the drawer shelf means I don't get a rattling vibration noise when the brewer runs, and the drawer slide action is very smooth.  The drawer extends far enough out that it's easy to get the last cup in a row, so you can see all the cups at once - much better than digging around in a bunch of boxes.  The whole thing feels very sturdy, and has a nice modern look to it."
"I've tried a number of protein powders over the years.  Most problems I encountered ranged from poor taste, to not mixing well, to leaving me bloated.  The Healthy n Fit egg protein is only 100 calories and you get 24 grams of protein with no cholesterol, no fat, no carbs, minimal sodium (in the big scheme of things) and even some potassium.  Add to that the fact that it mixes really well and tastes good either on it's own or mixed with fruit.  I don't feel bloated with this at all like I did with other products like Muscle Milk light.  I usually throw a banana and some blueberries into a blender with one serving of the protein for breakfast and then I use it straight right after a good workout.  Again, it tastes great on it's own or mixed with fruit.  I strongly recommend this product."
They are awesome to snack on.  They have a little kick to them but that's the best part.  They help me with my cravings for sweets.
"This is my absolute FAVORITE hot chocolate! Stephen's Gourment Hot Cocoa is all over Utah, but I have been unable to find it anywhere else.  I love it so much that I even pay shipping and handling so that I can enjoy it all the way on the east coast, too.  It's SO good! I look forward to it every year."
"I love rice and really had hopes that this product would be great. Rice can be a pain to make, with this only taking 90 seconds in the microwave, it was really appealing! Really I should have known better though... a product being cooked in a plastic bag is going to come out smelling like plastic. The smell of plastic was pretty stomach turning, couldn't possibly be good for you...."
"This honestly good.  It does not taste like syrup or cough medicine like one of the reviewers raves.  It taste like carbonated water with a hint of Raspberry flavoring.  Everything is natural and if you add some of your favorite juice like lets say...Orange, you can easily make a nice Italian soda...Yummy!  Don't be fooled, it's great."
"I don't know... maybe I got a bad batch. The pastry was sandy in texture, broken in a million pieces by the time it got here. I reconstructed one to give it a try. The filling had a strange, bitter taste; the bad aftertaste was horrible. Such a shame, because I have enjoyed other Mr. Kipling products. Try Mr. Kipling's Cherry Bakewells (yum!) or Battenbergs. I wouldn't even give these a second try."
"I love these - they taste great.  But I get them in the local Dollar Store. Two stars for the value, five for taste."
"On an empty stomach, in a controlled environment, with plenty of water, I felt no physical change to stress levels, at least not the way that you feel an immediate sense of relaxation from Xanax. Like homeopathic medicince (highly diluted), this product is bunk.<br /><br />But it tastes good, and maybe it could have a little placebo effect."
"I actually did say to my brother on one occasion, I would take almond milk with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002DHNBAO"">Kellogg's Raisin Bran Cereal, 20-Ounce Boxes  (Pack of 4)</a> over a steak dinner. Yeah, I know I'll probably never get a date again. Word up; it's elegnicity."
"We ordered the salt and pepper version since they were on sale and we really like PopChips.  They were AWFUL!  Honestly, we couldn't eat them because they were so hot.  I would not have thought that ""salt and pepper"" would have been so incredibly heavy on the pepper.  Our mouths were burning and it wasn't a good burn!  We will continue to buy Popchips but never the salt and pepper variety again."
I really enjoyed this peanut butter powder and need to buy some more as I am out.  I use it for my Herbalife shakes.
"I bought this product thinking it would be a great substitute for lemon peel  . I also wanted to save time from grating lemons . I put the product in lukewarm water to reconstitute it . It smelled like chemicals and tasted even worse . I make lemon bread to give as gifts ,this product was totally unacceptable to put in my bread."
"Very loud.  We have a larg dog that likes to counter surf and is always hungry.  Thought this would be good for prolonging his mealtime and making it challenging for him.  Even though I put small dog food in, it was extremely difficult to get the food out.  He gave up after about 5 minutes.  Was disappointed in product."
"Kettle Branch Potato Chips New York Cheddar:  These are good if you like kettle fried potato chips that are waaaay salty, on the burnt side, and taste rancid, either because the cheese flavoring or the oil it was fried in was already old.  I want to like this brand of chips and try their new and other flavors every now and then.  But, after having tried all sorts of other brands of kettle cooked chips, these just don't hit the spot for me."
"My senses were surprised by the aroma of the glistening beans as well as the satisfying flavor of the brew.<br />I substituted this bean when Amazon dropped Starbucks Sumatra from their Subscribe & Save program.<br />Now I would never go back.<br />I use a ceramic cone drip filter into a Nissan Thermal Carafe for our brew.<br />For an organic bean, this Breakfast Blend is top of the heap.<br />{{* *}}"
"These tea biscuits are also my favorite, I love having them with chai tea or ovaltine."
"If you want a truly healthy, filling snack, you must give these a try, as well as their sisters, the Vanilla Bean Almonds. They are both just lightly sweetened, and fragrant with either the cinnamon or the vanilla, depending on which you choose. The container is marvelous; there is a half flip top which is easy to do with one hand (like in the car). And they're not roasted in more oil, so the almonds are ""meaty"" and sweet. And almonds are SOOO good for you. I'd recommend that you try them, and then get an Amazon subscribe and save if you can. It's well worth it! And all natural. LOVELY!"
"This product is great cooking pork chops.....boneless or bone in.  It adds taste as well as keeps the meat moist and tender. We use it often, and recommend it to friends!"
"Each bag is only 100 calories, so it makes a perfect snack. And they taste great, they have become a staple in our pantry!"
"Love the smell of the ghee, just reminded me of the authentic ghee we used to get back in India. The fact that the ghee is made of grass-fed cows is for me a huge relief. I am so glad I found this treasure. Hope they reduce the price a little so that I can buy more with out guilt."
"I'm not a gourmet coffee critic, but this stuff is disappointing.  Based upon previous good reviews, I suspect that the coffee in the K-cups I received is not the same -- they may have changed the manufacturing.  The Wolfgang Puck Decaf I received is lifeless, watery, and tasteless.  There's no aroma when it's brewing in the Keurig.  Never again."
"This is a good tasting K-cup from a guy who drinks coffee black and prefers a bold, full flavored taste. I would recommend."
"This toy seems well-made, which is important for my puppy who is a powerful chewer and destroyer. Sometimes, though, the base can be difficult to screw back on after filling it with kibble.<br /><br />I have used the toy with my 8-month-old, medium-sized dog 3 times now, putting her kibble meal inside instead of treats. The first time she used it, she was frustrated and confused, and my mom just gave her the food inside after a while. The second time, I was with her and constantly encouraged her but didn't touch the toy. She got all of the kibble out except for a few pieces after significant efforts. She eventually discovered a way of manipulating it (tipping the jar upside down to stand on the narrow neck) that was most successful. The kibble came out many pieces at a time instead of just one piece at a time, which was happening often before. The third time, I barely watched her, and she had the food out pretty quickly. She started to get really frustrated with the toy, wanting more kibble to come out. I examined the toy, and there wasn't a single kibble left! This surprised me that she was so quick, but a similar thing happened when I introduced her to the Kong. It was quite hard the first time; but, after that, she seemed to have easy success."
"i'm giving this a solid 5, because my old but healthy cat loves this stuff and it's wicked good for him, but i'll tell you right now that this stuff looks and smells quite gross; as long as i don't have to eat it, it's all good."
"Popcorn oil solidified once it was in my house. This does not do so well in my new popcorn machine. I have to squeeze the oil out of the compartment then microwave it to make it liquid,  then I have to put it in my popcorn machine. Also when my shipment arrived the box the popcorn was in, looked as though one of the oils had leaked. Not sure if this is normal for all of this to have occurred but I'm just not happy with the way the oil has set up like concrete in the package. I was not happy with the popcorn purchase."
"I've had the other Annie's shells and cheddar and they're usually very good. I wanted to try whole wheat to be healthier, but it's really not worth it. It has a different texture that I didn't like. The flavor was okay but a little bland. If you want a good mac and cheese, stick with the original version from Annie's!"
"This coffee tastes very flavorful and is not too strong, but I have to say it almost ruined my months' old Keurig Personal Brewer. The coffee is ground so finely that when the K-Cups are punctured by the needles (top and bottom), it gets packed into the needles and also sifts out through the holes made by the needles, going into the coffee cup creating a very nasty ""sludge"" in the bottom of each cup. I purchased a pack of 2 (48 K-Cups) and didn't even use one full pack. I do not recommend this brand or blend. It is a waste of money, which is something I couldn't really afford at this time. I sent a letter of complaint to the Wolfgang Puck company and, except for a ""cookie cutter"" letter acknowledging receipt of my comment, I have not received any further contact from them."
"It is just like a k-cup...no ground left in the bottom of my coffee.  Makes a strong, hot cup of Joe.  The cup melts to the shape of your coffee maker.  It works wonderfully, but when i did the math for saving a few bucks...the whole reason i went looking for an alternative...it is just about the same as buying the prepackaged cups (i try to buy the K-cups around $28), except you can choose your own coffee and YOU have to measure it out.  Now i have not used all 50 cups yet so i will see if some of my coffee is left over and then it might be a little cheaper. The breakdown... $18 dollars for the disposable cups (shipping included), and $10 for my favorite coffee + time to fill the cups + environmentally wasteful = We need a better solution.  The reusable filters received mixed reviews, but i might give it a shot."
Same tasty product I had when I was learning to cook.  It is handy to keep in the pantry.  It is one of the few ways that I like to cook pork.
"I recently purchased several of these from the PrettyPartyPlace, and while the bottles are tiny, they certainly get the job done! I put two drops in my 32 oz of homemade creamer, and it is definitely English Toffee flavor. Also, the buyer ships quickly (with USPS). What a great product!"
The granola bars are pretty decent. They bars are lightly honeyed so it is not too sweet but still sweet enough. The bar is well textured and contains bits of nuts with the flax. 72 bars of it might be a bit much but it is definitely manageable as it lasts a decent amount of time.
I got a similar variety pack at Costco and every flavor was amazing.  Unfortunately they left me wanting MORE!  Much better tasting than other 100 calorie snacks especially if you are a chocolate lover!
take a cup of salt water add smoke and drink it that how bad it was in my opinion yepper full of salt
"I bought this toy for my 9 month old lab and had to return this twice. My dog loved it, but he dropping it on our hardwood floors and the bottom twist off part broke with each one. Good concept but plastic too brittle. Company does stand behind it, just not good for my dog."
"I didn't buy this product but got it as a gift , I tried it and it is greasy ,mushy and brown. It doesn't taste like summer sausage but like a mistery meat mush.It tasted almost like potted meat but worse.I am glad I didn't waste my money on the product.I won't recommend."
"These are good sunflower seeds at a good price if you prefer the unsalted variety, which can be hard to find.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind though, is the expiration or ""best by"" date.  For example, if you order these in April and the batch you receive has a June ""use by"" date, it may be a stretch to consume the 300 bags before the seeds start going rancid on you.  Since they're roasted in oil and unsalted, these seeds may spoil more readily than the salted variety, even if refrigerated upon receipt.<br /><br />Amazon doesn't seem to specify ""use by"" dates for the food products they sell, so it's a gamble for the purchaser.  I'm assuming that Amazon won't ship stuff that has ""expired"", but they probably ship out the oldest stock first, and the ""use by"" date on the item may not be what you would select if you had a choice."
This mix is so good and so versatile that you can make multiple types of drinks.  It is great replacing the water with ice cubes and blending.  The frozen drinks this make is fantastic.  I would never use anything else
"This popcorn is perfectly seasoned and uses oil with butter flavor.  And it's convenient, self-contained in a sealed package.  Just open it and dump it into the popcorn maker.  Ever since I discovered this popcorn, I have not reverted to the old boring popcorn."
This has a strongly bitter taste of lime when made as directed.  Definitely not a natural made from scratch taste.  It made the worst tasting Margaritas that I've ever had.  My initial response is to just pour the rest of it down the drain and cut my losses.  I'm glad I only bought one bottle to try.
This is without a doubt the most incredibly addictive packaged cookie in the world. The dark chocolate dipping at one end is a great contrast to the rolled wafer of the cookie itself. Why did I ever buy a whole case! Bless Amazon for carrying the Bahlsen line of fabulous cookies because it is not available in Montana.
Very disappointed with purchase.  The dates were so dried up where it tasted like leather instead of dates.  Must have been sitting there for a long long time.
"My dogs love these. the pills go down easy, the dog dosen't know the pill is in there. They beg fot these as treats long after the pills are gone."
"I am one of those people who like sweet lemon chicken. This is not sweet. It is not spicy, either. The yellow dye is very excessive and your fingers can stain if you touch the sauce. If you want to try it out, I'd recommend buying one packet if you can."
Both my dogs love these treats.  They trouble with rawhides and chicken strips but have had not trouble with these.
"I have been giving my dog these treats for years, thinking I was giving her something healthy.  I took her to my vet because she has been having bladder issues.  That's when the vet told me not to give them to her because they were made in China.  She said dogs have been getting sick from eating jerky treats made in China.  I can't believe I have been poisoning my poor little dog!  I will never buy another food product from CHINA!"
"Delicious, no added sugar, and perfect consistency! I eat them plain, add them to salads or cottage cheese, and always without guilt. Easily the best dried fruit I've ever had!"
"Not worth the cost.<br /><br />I have only had these as free samples.<br /><br />I would pay $5 for a pack of 10. I may even be willing to pay $10.00 for a pack of 10.<br />Anything more than $10 is total robbery.<br /><br />So, obviously, $17.99 is WAY too much.<br /><br />This product is SUPER cool, and I LOVED how it worked.<br /><br />But, really? $18.00?<br /><br />Mberry should Market their product as a food enhancer, not as a ""Flavor tripping experience"".<br /><br />If Mberry does that, and prices their products reasonably, it WILL gain customers.<br /><br />Keeping there product around as a ""Flavor tripping experience"" will surely make it a passing fad."
"For those of you who, like me, had to order the Kettle Spicy Thai chips from Amazon because they are so hard to find locally, you will probably be aggrieved to know that the recipe has changed.  They are just like regular potatoe chips.  I paid for them but now my husband gets to eat them because he didn't like the spicy thai, but these are fine for him.<br /><br />Yuck!!!"
"This is our favorite k-cup coffee, it is strong - and taste great (although it seems that many of the k-cups) have nearly the same overall taste..."
Items was timely delivered and in great condition.  If you are familiar with this line of cereal than you will love being able to buy in bulk and have it shipped directly to you.
"MORE OF THE PRODUCT IN THE PACKING BOX ARE LEAKING OUT, AT LEAST 10 OF THE SINGLE SERVE PACKAGES LEAK OUT IN THE BOX. WITH ALL THE CREAMERS I HAVE ORDERED THROUGH YOU HAVE PACKAGES THAT HAVE LEAKED ALL OVER THE BOX. I AM LOOKING AT OTHER SOURCES FOR MY PRODUCT."
These are pretty good. I haven't tried any other brand of these but just judging this brand alone I would buy again. The price is good and the product taste great. I eat 12 of them as a lunch so they don't last very long.
"This drink is very, very sweet, and only mildly carbonated.<br /><br />I don't drink soda, but i do occasionally like bubbles in my drinks. I had some hope that Switch would be a nice bubbly fruit drink to fill this need, but it's not. The ingredients may be all-natural, but it's still syrupy, and has an odd aftertaste that i think is from the added vitamin C.<br /><br />For regular soda drinkers, the sweetness may not be as offensive, but for anyone expecting something that tastes like sparkling fruit juice, this will be a disappointment. I'd still choose this over an orange soda, but i'd choose to have nothing at all rather than this.<br /><br />Also, note that the cans are only 8.3 ounces each, smaller than normal 12oz soda cans."
"I tried to change my review to 4 stars, but I don't seem able to do that.  These are 3 oz cans of 4 different flavors of fish based catfood.  Chicken and rabbit are often more recommended for cats.  The first ingredient is fish broth, making it somewhat high in moisture.  I've heard that cats often need more water than they drink, so I'd assume its a good thing to get more moisture down them, but this is an expensive way to do it (you could just add a little water to their food).  The good news is that there appears to be no grains in the ingredient list, looks like almost all meat based (except for the usual additives).  The grains in most catfoods are thought to not be good for the cats.  This catfood is not cheap, but it appears to be a better than usual cat food."
"Great Product, these are my Chihuahuas favorite treat.  I have never had any problems with them except the bucket runs out to fast."
You will not find better tasting soup anywhere.  I initially purchased it because my wife is sensitive to MSG and other kinds of additives that are found in most soups.  After eating some myself I now keep a supply on hand for all of the family.
"I have used this product for many years.  It is ORGANIC/NON-GMO which is a requirement for me, as well as the good nutrition analysis, ease of use, and cost.  Morinu is packaged with a shelf life of 9-12 months, needs no refrigeration, and can easily adapt to most recipes and smoothies.  My pantry is never without Morinu Organic Firm Tofu and Amazon has the best price."
"I like this bread, and several other flavors in this brand.  This one and the seven grain are my favorites.  They bake consistently well in my Wolfgang Puck machine.  Recommended!"
"First things first: if you've been drinking powdered drink mixes flavored with aspartame or similar chemicals, True Lemonade will probably take a bit of getting used to.  These days, everything is ridiculously over-sweetened, and our taste buds have become accustomed to it.  Now that I've been drinking True Lemonade for years, I don't know how I ever drank the other stuff.  It's all sickeningly sweet.<br /><br />True Lemonade is milder but perfectly palatable.  It won't replace fresh-squeezed lemonade or anything of that sort, but when it comes to naturally flavored, low calorie drink mixes, it's the best game in town.  I can't stand plain water, and this jazzes it up very nicely.  The flavor isn't watery or over-sweetened (and I actually use the packets meant for 16 oz in my 25 oz water bottle, so I get a much milder flavor than most people do).<br /><br />My only complaints might not apply to everyone, since they have to do with the packaging.  I wish True Lemon offered a container of just powder, sans the packets, since I don't use it on the go, and the packets just create extra waste.  I also recommend ordering from Amazon, because the official True Lemon store likes to send outrageous amounts of plastic packing peanuts along with the order, which shows a real lack of environmental awareness.  Amazon's packaging is much less wasteful."
"I ordered this for my brother's 30th Birthday cake and having never used anything like it before I was a bit clumsy with it.  There isn't much, but it goes a long way. It covered the chocolate genache great and it looked very cool-as did my entire kithen for a week because it gets everywhere...proceed with caution in the kitchen."
"My dogs love this and each figured out different techniques to get food out - took a while for them to get good at it. The Pit Bull holds her paws around the rubber ring and turns it over to pour some out. The Heinz 57 bats it around until something falls out, just beginning to hold the rope with 1 paw and hit the jug with the other. They are tied for time to get all the treats out!<br /><br />This cannot be played with on tile or wood floors - too noisy for people and jug slides too much for dogs. It would work in a crate, but I won't leave my dogs alone with ANY toy of this sort.<br /><br />It is hard to find dog goodies that will come out most are too thick to pass through. Charlee Bear Treats(any flavor) <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002QX3Q0"">Charlee Bear Dog Treats 16Oz Zip Pack Cheese/Egg</a> work perfectly as do larger sized cat treats. I love watching the dogs as they figure out a new way to make it work. No one has eaten off the rubber ring (the toy would still work if they did) and no one has chewed off the rope. (You could replace the rope or put in some sort of ball as someone else did.)<br /><br />I'd have given this 5 stars except for the noise on hard floors."
These are just delicious. Better than the traditional chip and better for you too! I would recommend that everyone try them. I plan to order more flavors and more and more.
"I first encountered this flavor at an airport magazine stand.  I sampled a couple and was hooked.  I thought this flavor was the best of all in the TicTac line.  On my flight, I was munching on the pack absent-mindedly.  I landed with the idea of buying several packs.  Then came the rude surprise - Grapefruit flavor is not a common sight on TicTac stands - anywhere.<br /><br />I finally settled on this purchase as the only way to maintain a steady supply.  This flavor of TicTac is best used as a ""chaser"", following a heavy-duty breath freshening from TicTac Power Mint, the blue color.  Not only is Power Mint effective, it also numbs out my tongue for several minutes.  A follow-up with a single Grapefruit restores my mouth to normality.<br /><br />I rate Grapefruit as the best flavor, with Watermelon and the new Strawberry Foelds close seconds.  In general any flavor TicTac is effective breath-freshening, but Grapefruit is truly addicting.  TicTac settles the issue that the tongue is a major contributor to sour breath."
"No disappointments with this coffee. I have always been fond of Melitta coffee and this lived up to their great reputation, although a bit pricey."
"I picked up a package during an airport layover and since I won't be back to LAX soon... decided to check Amazon for some more.  The 4 oz package cost 7.99 at the airport, so you do get a small price break by buying them here in triple packs.<br />WOW!  The flavor is amazing.  I don't know if the other reviewer got a bad batch -- or what -- but mine were crunchy walnuts with the smoothest slightly sweet tasting thick dark chocolate coating.  One bite and I was hooked.<br />If you are looking for a sweet treat for your sweetie, look no further.  this should be in every adult Easter basket or Christmas stocking.  I haven't raved about a candy like this since See's dark chocolate covered raspberry cremes!<br /><br />If you like walnuts and dark chocolate, you will absolutely love these.  The taste is so pleasurable it is hard to describe.  I just ordered 6 packages, for me and to use as gifts.  Amazon, you need to start selling these so I can use prime shipping!  (these will fly off the shelf, I promise!)<br /><br />ingredients:  Organic Walnuts, organic ark chocolate coating -- ooh there is some organic chocolate liquour and soy lethicin in there, that's why it's so tasty and smooth.  Contains small amounts of milk, soy wheat and egg and is manufactured in a plant that processes peanuts.  Made in the USA by Tropical Valley Foods.<br /><br />YES, these will melt in your hand or the hot sun, so be forewarned!"
"I used to get this product at Walmart but in there great wisdom they stopped carrying it. I love this product as it is light, easy on the diet."
"I am always feeding my dogs chicken jerky, I love how this product has Glucosamine and Chondroitin in it. I am not sure how many I would have to feed though to get the true effects, I only feed 1 a day to each of my 4 dogs.<br /><br />They love these, as they love all the Dogswell products. For smaller dogs, make sure you break up into smaller pieces as I had a pug almost choke on chicken jerkey ( not this brand )"
"Since flowers are mostly bought either for or by women, it seems self destructive to support someone who denigrates your entire customer base.  Not all of us have bought into the conservative war on women's health led by Rush and his Republican cronies., nor will we continue to support companies that do.<br /><br />The personal attack made on a college student is unacceptable and I do not accept any apology from this misogynist bully.<br />I imagine my daughter in this position and go ballistic! All women are someone's daughter, wife or mother. How would you feel if these comments were made about your wife, mother or daughter?<br /><br />Rush Limbaugh has been getting away with these kind of personal attacks for years... well no more.  The climate in this country is changing and we will not stand for this any more."
"The product is a good value for the amount you get, however it is way too salty.  The product is very dry and firm.  I think this would be good if they cut the salt content in half."
"I loved this product and participated in the subscription service. However, my last shipment came in a newly designed box and the formula of the coconut/guava mixture had changed.  There is more guava juice now, which I find overwhelming.  The sugar content has also increased.  I've had to purchase plain coconut water to mix with my last order to tone down the guava flavor.  I am not a fan of the change and plan to cancel my monthly subscription.  Beware if you were a fan of the old true splash of guava formula."
I love Chunky candy bars-they remind me of being a kid and sharing them with my dad!  When this package arrived the outer card board box was sealed but the actual silver box of candy was not. The box was missing 3 candy bars not a big deal when you have ordered 24 except I now wonder  what other tampering could have been done.  I would go with a seller directly and not try to save by using Amazon Prime for this one!
"I have tried many many many different brands. I also did my research on what's the best for my Dane and most of it is expensive. I found this to be very good quality and a good price among Chicken Soup and Canidae.<br />My GD loves this he eats 7-8 cups a day and he would love to eat more. He has a shiny coat, no allergies and his sensitive stomach thanks the food. I highly recommend this. But I am buying it somewhere else a little cheaper and 2 day shipping. ;)"
"I'd give it three stars for the approximately 50% of puffs that have little or no cheese on them, and five stars for the ones that have a lot (maybe too much?). I have been eating Michael Seasons puffs and curls for at least two years and can't help but notice how their production has shifted from full-flavored to light-flavored (after which I wrote the company) to mixed-flavored. It seems they produce one batch of light and one batch of full flavored and then mix the two. Are they expecting nobody to notice? At least my wife loves to pick out the light flavored puffs leaving me the full flavored creating a kind of bonding experience if you will, but if I were eating this by myself I'd be annoyed. Still, because they contain at least partially organic ingredients, and because they taste so well overall, there's no other brand that beats them so I keep ordering anyway."
"I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).<br /><br />The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers. A requirement is to exclusively feed Science Diet to the animals.<br /><br />TRY THIS INSTEAD: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001BCUBZ0"">Castor & Pollux Ultramix Indoor Feline Fomula Dry Cat Food, 15-Pound Bag</a>"
"When I bought this food, I saw the image and price and assumed that I would be paying a fair price ($1 less per bag than the grocery store) for low grade cat food. The image and price combination led me to think that I would be paying $45 for 6 18lb+ bags - a good deal. When I received six 3.6lb bags, I thought there had been a mistake. Nope. So, I spend $40+ returning it (I bought three 6 packs - oops) and now Ozbo customer service tells me they take 2-3 weeks processing returns! My kitties need food now, and these people want to sit on my $180 for that long? DO NOT BUY FROM THESE SCAMMERS !!!"
Holy cow it didn't read the size when I ordered this. This is like having a liqueur cabinet in your coffee bar. So far we have tried and used up the hazelnut and vanilla we just started on the caramel and its ok but I think I will move on to chocolate. Great buy if you drink coffee everyday like we do and don't want to add the extra cals to your morning ritual.
"I Love the Blue Sky Energy Drink, Wild Berry Flavor, but was used to drinking the 8 oz size that I would buy at the grocery store, so I was very surprised to receive a whopping 16 oz size via Amazon. Since I was used to drinking the 8 oz size with no problem, I gave it no thought to drink the 16 oz. BOY was that a mistake. Not only did it make me VERY nervous, but it was entirely too much 'energy' for my system at once. From then on I only drank half a can at a time and I was fine. They should put a warning on this stuff. DO NOT DRINK A WHOLE CAN."
"These are a nice, light alternative to ordinary potato chips. To me, they have a sort of buttery flavor. They're crunchy, a little sweet, and not the least bit greasy. My husband took some to work and they were a huge hit with his coworkers. In fact, he had none left for himself!"
"I love Big Train! There is a local shop that sales Big Train Products.  After spending $20 a week on the stuff, I decided that I wanted to make it at my house sometimes to save a little money. The individual bags are the exact bags that the local shop uses.  I do prefer the consistency of the product when made by the shop, I think that has to do with my blender's age.  Overall, this product is super yummy!"
Excellent service. Goat milk is delivered in premium condition.I will continue to order online. Thank you.
excellent product no imitation about to place another order came in two days great service i'm sold just try it you'll see also bought the sorrel great together
These were great almonds. I am using them for my wedding favors and they are an elegant treat. Great flavor & fresh!
"Some people may put Shake N Bake anything in the same category as Ramen Noodles, but I don't really care about all that. This little pouch is a life saver, not to mention time saver. I have an 18 month old and sometimes attempting to cook anything is impossible. I need something quick and easy. Well, this is it. Literally, just shake and bake. Anybody can do this, it requires zero skill. And it actually is tasty. I leave mine in the oven a couple minutes longer than the suggested time, because I like my chicken somewhat on the crispy side. Pair it with anything you want, for you can't go wrong!"
"I decided to give a try to roasting my own beans, and so bought these relatively cheap green beans.  I just used a heavy stainless steel pan with a lid and did it on the stovetop.  It took a bit longer than expected because I was purposely going kind of slow (maybe 25-30 minutes), but the results came out great!<br /><br />THis coffee has good complexity and earthiness, and it's not excessively acidic.  Very smooth overall, and I would readily order this again.  It is one of my favorite coffees I've tried."
"really nice tea, and smells wonderful. I enjoy it with a teaspoon of ""sugar in the raw.""  Stores well as is wrapped in foil. I usually buy the box of 100 teabags since it is an excellent value"
"when i saw these for the first time online, i thought ""sweet deal!"" and i purchased it and when it was delivered, i was so disappointed. the whole thing is about the size of my hand. not going to buy this again and i don't recommend it at all :("
"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck."
"I ordered this coffee under the impression that it was a medium roast,that was according to the brief description & by zooming in the box on my laptop. On the the side of the box it stated medium. When the coffee arrived today it is not medium it is light. No medium on the box at all, just light. I am very disapointed with this purchase as I wanted at least a medium roast flavor. To be able to get a full flavor at all you will need to use a very small amount of water & make a very small cup of coffee. I'm sure I could send it back but the hassle is not worth it, but will not buy again. If you like extremely light coffee this is for you, if you like to taste your coffee this is No good. I will order bold from now on. As far as taste there is none unless you make about a 4 oz. cup even then it's not very good.<br />Amazon did ship very fast,I received the order sooner than expected & it was packaged very well.<br />Too bad the coffee was not what I ordered/ expected."
"I used to get this at the 7-11 for five cents each so it brought back memories from my childhood. When I was little, it came in all flavors.<br />This package was the same product and as good as I remembered, but it was<br />like a multi row of flavors for each bar. When I was little, each bar was a seperate flavor"
The quality of Tofu is very good. But it is a little bit more soft than what I expected. I will try the firm version.
I bought this as a gag gift because my wife loves peppermint patties.  Turns out we are goign to start ordering more of these because it saves us a little bit of money
These chips are incredible! Enough can't be said about them. They are better than potato chips and without the guilt of fat and calories!
My little guy ate this all up before I could even write a review!  :)
Robust and aromatic from the time you pop the container top to the last drops in the pot.<br /><br />Great flavor black or mixed with cream and/or sugar.
"I was introduced to this tea at a local restaurant and went absolutely crazy about it. Its unique flavor and healthifying blend of green and black teas and yerba mate, along with a light touch of ginger, is a wonderful thirst quencher.  As a tonic for health and energy, I now find myself drinking it daily instead of my usual afternoon coffee. It perks up the body and brain without the jittery effects of caffeine. I find I get a delightful pick-me-up later in the day--when I need it--without the negative affects of keeping me up at night.  While a tad expensive, I will continue to buy SPORtea and enjoy its delicious brew.  It is now a part of my every day routine."
"These Honey Dijon chips bring a terrific balance of salty, tangy, sweet and crunchy. Other brands I've tried use too much mustard flavor, which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing.<br /><br />These chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans, coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat. Naturally, they also go down great with beer.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend these other Kettle Chips flavors: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBUA"">Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."""
"I was at a charity fund raising event where they were handing these out. They seemed pretty tasty, so I bought a couple bags at Target. The ones I bought (Barbeque and Salt and Vinegar) were AWFUL! I ended up throwing away most of them, neither I nor anyone else who tried them could choke them down. The ones they were handing out as samples were clearly very different from what they are selling. Don't waste your money."
"and they definitely do, being as i tried out this whole 24 pack. They taste alright and not too much fat or calories but i dont know why but they give me gas!! At first I was confused but then I realised when I ate them is when Id later stink up the room. Never again!"
"A while back I was looking for more natural sweeteners so I decided to give agave a try on the recommendation of others.  I had success with another maple-flavored agave for pancake topping, but this version left an unpleasant plastic-y taste in my mouth.<br /><br />Since learning that agave is very similar to high fructose corn syrup, I've switched to more natural sweeteners: maple syrup, honey and rapadura."
"The local auto shop offers this free to it customers. I've tried it twice and liked it both times. Perhaps, if I had to pay for it, I might not love the price, but I would still enjoy the flavor."
"The pork rinds cooked up fairly well in the microwave, but the smell was less than appetizing and the taste was fair at best."
"Unfortunately having ordered quite a few of these previously, I neglected to not look for the word: ""supreme"" in this offer and since I was then receiving free shipping had 4 delivered. We (that is my husband, guests and me)knew immediately that these were different from those previously enjoyed. BUT, currently Amazon featured the ""supreme"" babka and now I am awaiting to receive these. In the future, I will read more carefully."
"Once you've tried some random sampler packs (and now are overloaded with decafs,extra bolds, or teas), this is a great way to get exactly the brands or style that you want.  Received the order in a couple of days and was exactly what I ordered.  This was my second order and I'll be ordering this item again."
